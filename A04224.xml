            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst the infinite number of great <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>olumes wherewith the world ≈øeemes, as it were, to bee wayed downe, there bee few of them that were written at once, or were at first publi≈øhed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Writings as they con≈øist of ≈øun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry natures; ≈øo they will beare a diuers maner of Edition. To ≈øet foorth an Art by pieces, is to ≈øhew you a body di≈ømembred; the one is no more vncomely, then the other is vnproper. To publi≈øh a <hi>Hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> before it be at an end, is to turne the Hower-gla≈øse before it bee runne out; neither of both will giue you a trew ta≈øte of the time. But writings of other Natures, Common places and Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies, Meditations and Commentaries, as they are for the most part, accidentally taken vp, ≈øo they are as occa≈øionally ≈øet out: They craue no other birth into the world, then they had conceptions in our braines, ≈øingly by vs conceiued, and ≈øingly by them≈øelues ≈øet out.</p>
            <p>The different maner of <hi>GOD</hi> his ≈øetting foorth of his owne Workes, may in≈øtruct vs in this point. His diuine Wi≈øedome held one cour≈øe in his Naturall Workes, an other in his Ceremonialls, Politicalls and Moralls. Jn his Naturalls he made a ma≈ø≈øe at once, which ≈øpeedily he diuer≈øified into diuers formes. Hee gaue a kinde of potentiall delineation of all things in that vniuer≈øall matter, which pre≈øently hee di≈øtingui≈øhed into diuers <hi>Species</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:23110:6"/>perfection: But in his Ceremonialls, hee takes another cour≈øe, he brings not them out of a Ma≈ø≈øe, but into a Ma≈ø≈øe: He doeth not out of a <hi>Totum</hi> produce the parts, but out of the parts make vp the whole. For example; Jn the Ceremonialls, fir≈øt he beginnes with Sacrifice, long after he followes with Circumci≈øion, then hee filleth a Tabernacle with them; at la≈øt makes them full vp in a Temple. Jn his Politicalls, hee beginnes with a paternall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in a family, proceeds to an Election of a Captaine in an Armie, as in <hi>Io≈øuah</hi> and the Judges, perfects it by way of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øsion in a ≈øetled Kingdome, as in <hi>Solomon</hi> and his Succe≈ø≈øors. Jn his Moralls, hee beginnes with the word out of his owne mouth, proceeds with the <hi>Tables</hi> written by his owne fingers, followes on with the fiue Bookes penned by <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> till hee make vp the <hi>Canon</hi> perfect by a number of ≈øucceeding <hi>Prophets.</hi>

            <p>What we haue from <hi>GOD</hi> in a pre≈øident, it may wel be≈øeeme vs to practi≈øe; and ≈øince his Bookes came out ≈øo farre a≈øunder, it is no reproach to any man, though his Workes come not foorth together: for there is a rea≈øon for it in vs an≈øwerable in ≈øome proportion to that of the Workes of <hi>GOD,</hi> for workes of Nature haue their roote from within vs, and bring with them a radicall kinde of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that neuer ≈øuffers them to rest, till they haue produced their fruite to perfect forme and perfection: Workes of deliberation and Art, haue their foundation from without vs, and giue vs occa≈øion to worke vpon them, as our phanta≈øies thinke fittest for the pre≈øent time: Hence proceeds it, that the workes of Nature haue ≈øo few errors in them, tho≈øe of Art ≈øo many; They of Nature ≈øo con≈øtant, they of Arte ≈øo variable; they of Nature ≈øo perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, they of Art ≈øo ≈øoone peri≈øh; they of Nature ≈øo well accepted and approued of all, they of Art accepted or reiected, as it plea≈øeth the ≈øeuerall apprehen≈øions of men to conceiue of them.</p>
            <p>Now, albeit the workes of men be of Errors ≈øo full, of nature ≈øo different, ≈øubiect to ≈øo many Jnterpretations, publi≈øhed at ≈øo diuers times; Yet hath it bene euer esteemed a matter commendable to collect them together, and incorporate them into one Body, that we may behold at once, what diuers Off-≈øprings haue proceeded
<pb facs="tcp:23110:6"/>from one braine, and how various Conceptions the wit of man is able to afford the world. To instance in a few of them beginning a little higher then the writings of ordinarie Men. The ≈øeruants of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> are commended in Scripture for collecting together the Sentences of <hi>Solomon. Ie≈øus</hi> the ≈øonne of <hi>Sirach</hi> is prai≈øed for ≈øearching out the Copies of his Grandfathers workes: But prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally <hi>Ezra</hi> is had in great honour for ≈øetting in order the whole Bookes of the Old Te≈øtament, and deuiding them into Chapters and <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>er≈øes, which before were caried along in a ≈øcroule, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall <hi>Series,</hi> without any distinction at all. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> is reported to haue ≈øearched out the Copies of the three former Euangelists, and to haue added his owne for the fourth in that order, as now they are extant. And the Primitiue Church was curious to gather together the Epistles of the Holy Apostles; which, they being not able by rea≈øon of per≈øecution perfectly to performe in euery place, gaue occa≈øion to after-times, to call the authority of ≈øo many of them into question.</p>
            <p>But to de≈øcend; How are we bound to tho≈øe, who haue laboured in ≈øetting out the <hi>Coun≈øells,</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> together? Jn≈øomuch, that we thinke our ≈øelues as much bound to <hi>Eu≈øebius</hi> and <hi>Hierom,</hi> and of later times to <hi>Peter Crab</hi> and <hi>Era≈ømus</hi> and diuers others, who haue laboured in that kinde, as wee doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt to the Authors them≈øelues. <hi>Traian</hi> commended <hi>Plutark</hi> for gathering the <hi>Apothegmes</hi> of wi≈øe men together. <hi>Con≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> the ≈øonne of <hi>Leo,</hi> collected out of all Histories, both in the Ea≈øt and West, one <hi>Corpus Hi≈øtoricum,</hi> which they counted an inestimable Trea≈øure. <hi>Iu≈øtinian</hi> by the helpe of <hi>Tribonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> did the like in the Lawes. <hi>Gratian</hi> compiled the Decrees out of the Epistles of <hi>Popes, Councells</hi> and <hi>Fathers. Dama≈øcen</hi> collected into one body of Diuinitie, the Sentences of the Greeke <hi>Fathers;</hi> And <hi>Peter Lumbard 400.</hi> yeeres after him by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample did the like in the Latine <hi>Fathers.</hi> And how doe wee labour to recouer Bookes that are lost? The Bookes of <hi>Origen</hi> that amounted to ≈øixe thou≈øand, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> witne≈øseth, were much laboured for by <hi>Eu≈øebius</hi> and others. The Bookes of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero
<pb facs="tcp:23110:7"/>de Repub.</hi> were much ≈øought for by Cardinall <hi>Poole;</hi> and great ≈øummes of money haue bene ≈øpent to recouer the lo≈øt <hi>Decades</hi> of <hi>Liuie.</hi> Wherefore ≈øince it hath beene heretofore the practi≈øe of all aages, to collect the workes of Men of worth, and pre≈øerue them from peri≈øhing; to labour much in recouering tho≈øe that haue bene lo≈øt; to giue to euery childe the owne Father; to euery Booke the trew Author: (for there neuer had bene halfe ≈øo many birds to haue flowen about the world with fal≈øe feathers, if euery Author had ≈øet out his owne workes together in his owne time,) J hope then it ≈øhall not be now a matter of reproofe in a Seruant, to trauaile in the ≈øetting foorth of the <hi>Works</hi> of his Ma≈øter; and for giuing you that together, which before yee could hardly get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øunder; and for pre≈øeruing that in a Ma≈ø≈øe from peri≈øhing, that might ea≈øily be lo≈øt in a Mite.</p>
            <p>But while I am collecting workes one way, I heare others ≈øcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering wordes as fa≈øt an other way, affirming, it had beene better his Maie≈øtie had neuer written any Bookes at all; and being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, better they had peri≈øhed with the pre≈øent, like <hi>Proclamations,</hi> then haue remayned to <hi>Po≈øterity:</hi> For ≈øay the≈øe Men, Little it befitts the Maie≈øty of a <hi>King</hi> to turne Clerke, and to make a warre with the penne, that were fitter to be fought with the Pike; to ≈øpend the powers of his ≈øo exqui≈øite an vnder≈øtanding vpon pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which had they beene ≈øpent on powder, could not but haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled ere this, for the Conque≈øt of a <hi>Kingdome.</hi> For a <hi>King,</hi> ≈øay they, to enter a Controuer≈øie with a Scholler, is, as if he ≈øhould fight a Combate with a Kerne; he doth no more de≈øcend from his Honour in the one, then he bringes vpon him≈øelfe Di≈øgrace by the other. And ≈øince that Booke-writing is growen into a Trade; It is as di≈øhonorable for a <hi>King</hi> to write bookes; as it is for him to be a Practitioner in a <hi>Profe≈ø≈øion.</hi> Jf a <hi>King</hi> will needs write; Let him write like a <hi>King,</hi> euery Lyne a <hi>Law,</hi> euery Word a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi> euery Letter a <hi>Mandate.</hi> Jn good trewth, I haue had my eares ≈øo oft dung through with the≈øe Obiections and the like, as I know not whether I conceiued ami≈øse of my ≈øelfe or no, thinking I had more ability to an≈øwere the≈øe Calumnyes, then I had patience
<pb facs="tcp:23110:7"/>to heare them: And therefore hauing ≈øo fit opportunity, J ≈øhall not let to deliuer my opinion; <hi>Whether it may ≈øorte with the Maie≈øtie of a King, to be a writer of Bookes, or no.</hi> First I could neuer reade, that there was any Law against it; and where we haue no Law, the best is to follow good Examples: And many Diuines are of opinion, that examples that are not contrary to any Precept, doe binde vs in practi≈øe, at least ≈øo farre; that though they doe not inforce vs to the doing, yet they warrant the deede when it is done; And if Examples will ≈øerue the turne, wee haue Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples enough.</p>
            <p>First to beginne with the <hi>King of Kings</hi> God him≈øelfe, who as he doth all things for our good; So doeth he many things for our Jmitation. Jt plea≈øed his Diuine wi≈øedome to bee the fir≈øt in this Rancke, that we read of, that did euer write. Hee wrote, and the writing was the writing, ≈øaith <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> of God; the maner was after the maner of engrauing; the matter was in Stone cut into two Tables, and the Tables were the worke of God written on both ≈øides. <hi>Diuines</hi> hold, that the Heart is the principall Seate of the Soule; which Soule of ours is the immediate worke of God, as the≈øe Tables were the immediate worke of his owne fingers. The Stone, the expre≈ø≈øe repre≈øent of the hardne≈øse of our heart; the engrauing the worke of God ≈øo deepely impre≈øsed, that it can neuer be blotted out; the writing, the writing of the Law in our hearts; In two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, for our double duty to God and Man; on both ≈øides to take vp our heart ≈øo wholly, that nothing contrary to tho≈øe Precepts ≈øhould euer haue any place in our Soules. And certainely from this little <hi>Library,</hi> that God hath erected within vs, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all our Learning layd; So that people Ciuillized doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them≈øelues depriued of one of the be≈øt abilities of nature, if they be not ≈øomewhat inabled by writing, to expre≈ø≈øe their mindes: And there is no Nation ≈øo bruti≈øh or Barbarous, that haue not inuented one kinde of Character or other, whereby to conuey to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers their inward Conceptions. From the≈øe Tables of God, wee may come to the writing of our Ble≈ø≈øed <hi>Sauiour,</hi> which we may put in the next place, though not for order yet for Honour. His Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb facs="tcp:23110:8"/>Maiestie left behinde him no Monument of writing, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by his owne hand in any externall Booke; for he was to induce and bring in an other maner of the writing of the Law of Loue; not in Tables of ≈øtone; written not with incke and paper, but in the Tables of our fle≈øhly hearts written by the Spirit of the Liuing God: Yet did he once with his owne finger, write on the Pauement of the Temple of <hi>Ieru≈øalem.</hi> What he writ, J will not now di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈ø≈øe. <hi>S. Ambro≈øe</hi> ≈øaith he wrote this Sentence: <hi>Fe≈øtucam in oculo fratris cernis, trabem in tuo non vides. Beda</hi> thinkes, he wrote that Sentence that he ≈øpake: <hi>He that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øinne, let him ca≈øt the fir≈øt ≈øtone at her. Haymo</hi> hath a pretty Conceit: He thinketh, he wrote certaine Characters in the Pauement, which the Accu≈øers beholding might ≈øee, as in a gla≈ø≈øe, their owne wickedne≈ø≈øe; and ≈øo blu≈øhing at it went their wayes. What euer it was, ≈øure we are, our <hi>Sauiour</hi> would haue fal≈øe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øations written in dust, to bee troden vnder foote of them that pa≈øse by. But how≈øoeuer, I ≈øay, our Ble≈øsed <hi>Sauiour</hi> did leaue behind him no writing of his owne hand; Yet we may not deny, but that God in the old <hi>Te≈øtament</hi> and our <hi>Sauiour</hi> in the New, haue left vs many bookes of their owne inditements: For all the Bookes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture were written by in≈øpiration; and the Prophets and Apo≈øtles were but their <hi>Amanuen≈øes,</hi> and writ onely as they were led and actuated by the Spirit of God: So that we may not make the Author of any of tho≈øe Bookes any other then God Him≈øelfe.</p>
            <p>The old world before the flood wil afford vs no writings, neither did that aage require them; for the liues of Men of that aage were liuing <hi>Libraries,</hi> and la≈øted longer then the labors of Men doe in this aage: Yet <hi>S. Iude</hi> doeth in≈øinuate ≈øomewhat of the writings of <hi>Enoch,</hi> who though he were not in Stile a <hi>King,</hi> Yet there is no rea≈øon to contend with him for that Title; for his Dominion would beare it, ≈øtanding Heire-Apparent to the greater part of the world. <hi>Origen, Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> report many things out of the ≈øuppo≈øititous writings that went vnder his name: And <hi>Io≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> and that <hi>Bero≈øus,</hi> that wee haue, tell vs, that hee erected
<pb facs="tcp:23110:8"/>two pillars, the one of Stone, the other of Bricke, wherein he wrote of the two-fold destructions of the world, the one by Water, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Fire: But how≈øoeuer that be trew, it is very probable, he wrote ≈øomething of that matter, which though it peri≈øhed with that world; yet doubtle≈ø≈øe the memory thereof was pre≈øerued by Tradition vnto the dayes of the <hi>Apo≈øtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>J will not here in≈øist vpon the writings of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> who was not onely a Prie≈øt, and a Prophet, but was, as him≈øelfe records, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the people a <hi>King,</hi> and was the fir≈øt that euer receiued au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie from <hi>GOD</hi> to write in <hi>Diuinitie:</hi> Neither will J in≈øi≈øt vpon the Example of <hi>King Dauid,</hi> in who≈øe <hi>P≈øalmes</hi> and <hi>Himnes,</hi> are re≈øounded out the prai≈øes of <hi>GOD</hi> in all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; for that J finde nothing that the≈øe men writ, but what they writ as the <hi>Scribes</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> acted, as I ≈øaid euen now, by <hi>GOD</hi> his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and not guided by their owne. Yet I ≈øuppo≈øe wee may ≈øafely collect thus much from them, that if <hi>GOD</hi> had thought it a matter derogatory to the Maie≈øtie of a <hi>King</hi> to bee a Writer, he would not haue made choice of tho≈øe, as his chiefe <hi>In≈øtruments</hi> in this kinde, who were principalls in that other Order. J would ea≈øily beleeue, that ≈øuch men as haue had the honour to be <hi>GOD</hi> his <hi>Pen-men,</hi> ≈øhould neuer vouch≈øafe to write any thing of their owne: for as we hold in a pious opinion, that the ble≈ø≈øed <hi>Virgine,</hi> hauing once conceiued by the <hi>holy Gho≈øt,</hi> would neuer after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by man; So ≈øurely men, that had deliuered nothing but the conceptions of that Spirit, ≈øhould hardly be drawne euer to ≈øet out any of their owne labours. But we ≈øee the flat contrary both in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> the one the greate≈øt Iudge, the other the mo≈øt glorious <hi>King,</hi> that euer that Kingdome had. <hi>Samuel,</hi> who writ by <hi>GODS</hi> appointment, the greate≈øt part of tho≈øe two Bookes, that beare his name, writ al≈øo by his owne accord, a Booke contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Law of a <hi>King,</hi> or In≈øtitution of a <hi>Prince,</hi> whereby hee laboured to keepe the <hi>King</hi> as well from declining to Tyrannie, as the people from running into Libertie. <hi>Solomon,</hi> be≈øides the Bookes of Scripture, which remaine, writ many likewi≈øe of his owne accord, which are lo≈øt: For to ≈øay nothing of his <hi>3000. Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>

Neither let any man ≈øuggest, that the≈øe writings, that are lost, and, as they ≈øay, were destroyed in the destruction of the Temple by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> were of the ≈øame authoritie, as tho≈øe that doe remaine: for J can hardly be induced to beleeue, that the writings, that were indited by the Spirit of <hi>GOD,</hi> layed vp in the <hi>Arke,</hi> receiued into the <hi>Canon,</hi> read publikely in the Church, are vtterly peri≈øhed. Jt is a de≈øperate thing to call, either the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of <hi>GOD,</hi> or the fidelity of the Church in que≈øtion in this point: For if tho≈øe, that haue bene, are peri≈øhed; then, why may not the≈øe that remaine as well be lo≈øt? which is contrary to our <hi>Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> a≈ø≈øertion, that one <hi>Iota</hi> ≈øhall not peri≈øh till all bee fulfilled: Therefore J rather incline to thinke; that what euer was Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ≈øtill is, then that any is lo≈øt: Neither is this opinion ≈øo curious to hold, as the other is dangerous to beleeue; Better it is euer, to argue our ≈øelues of ignorance, then to accu≈øe <hi>GOD</hi> of improuidence: But if ≈øo much Scripture be lo≈øt, as is alleadged, farewell <hi>GOD</hi> his prouidence, farewell the fidelitie of the Church, to who≈øe care was concredited the <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>GOD.</hi> Let vs come to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Kings,</hi> where we ≈øhall not incurre any danger of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouer≈øie; that were ≈øo farre from being acted by <hi>GOD</hi> his <hi>Spirit;</hi> that they were more like tho≈øe Di≈øciples of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that had not heard whether there were an <hi>Holy-Gho≈øt,</hi> or no; that knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>GOD,</hi> though they felt neuer ≈øo much of his Goodne≈ø≈øe; that neuer beleeued his Omnipotencie, though they had neuer ≈øo much experience of his Power.</p>

            <p>Therefore ≈øince wee are compa≈øsed about with ≈øuch a Clowd of <hi>Witne≈ø≈øes</hi> (albeit the≈øe are but a little handfull in compari≈øon of the infinite multitude, that might be produced,) Since we haue the examples of all the Mightie-men of the <hi>World,</hi> euen from the beginning thereof vnto this day; who haue ≈øtriuen as much to get a Name for their writings, as fame for their doings; haue affected as much to be counted Learned as <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ictorious; and to be reputed of, as much for their wi≈øe Sayings, as for their worthy Deeds; Why ≈øhould it bee thought a thing ≈øtrange in this time, that his <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtie,</hi> whom <hi>GOD</hi> hath adorned with as many rare perfections of Nature and Arte, as euer he did any that wee read of, (I except ≈øuch as were Diuinely in≈øpired) ≈øhould lend the world a few leaues out of the large <hi>Volumes</hi> of his <hi>Learning?</hi> J commend the wi≈øedome of our Aduer≈øaries, who hauing a≈øsayed all meanes, the wit of man is able to inuent, to incline his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> to like of their partie; and finding by all their Tricks, they haue got no ground, would at last put his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> to ≈øilence, and gaine thus much of him, at least; that ≈øince he will doe nothing for them; yet that he would ≈øay nothing against them. Therefore they cry out against his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> writing, and vpbrayd him more for that hee doeth write, then they doe for any thing that hee hath written: Jt is ynough to wonder at, that <hi>Rex ≈øcribit.</hi> The≈øe people are wi≈øe in
<pb facs="tcp:23110:13"/>their generation, and haue learned by long experience; that as the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>CHRIST</hi> is the Go≈øpel of peace, ≈øo it hath bene from the beginning ≈øpread more by the Pennes of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles,</hi> then by the power of <hi>Princes;</hi> more propagated by the ≈øweet writings of the ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> then it could bee ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed by the ≈øeuere Edicts of <hi>Emperours;</hi> and of late, their Kingdome hath bene more ≈øhaken by a poore Monke, then it hath bene able to recouer by the helpe of Mighty <hi>Monarches.</hi> Therefore ≈øince the writings of poore Schollers haue ≈øo rai≈øed the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and ≈øo di≈øcouered the <hi>My≈øterie</hi> of Jniquitie; they do well to feare what may follow vpon the Writings of ≈øo great a <hi>King.</hi>

            <p>They liue ≈øecurely from bleeding by his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> Sword; but they are not ≈øafe from being bla≈øted by the breath of his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> Bookes. Jf they could bring it about therefore, to calme and quiet his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> Spirit from working vpon them that way; as they ≈øee his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe to bee farre from drawing of their bloods the other way, they would deeme it a greater Conquest, then all the conuer≈øions of the <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi> and <hi>We≈øt-Indies</hi> they tell vs ≈øo many tales of: For they looke vpon his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> Bookes, as men looke vpon <hi>Bla≈øing-Starres,</hi> with amazement, fearing they portend ≈øome ≈øtrange thing, and bring with them a certaine Influence to worke great change and alteration in the world: Neither is their expectation herein deceiued; for we haue ≈øeene with our eyes, the Operation of his <hi>Maie≈øties Workes</hi> in the Con≈øciences of their men ≈øo farre, as from their highest <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claue</hi> to their lowest <hi>Cells,</hi> there haue bene, that haue bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by them; and that in ≈øuch number, as wee want rather meanes to maintaine them, then they minds to come to vs. But to conclude this point, that <hi>Kings</hi> may write; Giue mee leaue to offer you this Meditation.</p>
            <p>How many are the wayes that men doe inuent to perpetuate their Memorie! In≈øomuch, that mortall-men haue made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues Gods, when they were dead, that they might be adored, as if they were aliue. Wherein, is the <hi>Impetus</hi> of Nature ≈øo ≈øtrong,
<pb facs="tcp:23110:13"/>as in the affection that propogates to <hi>Po≈øteritie?</hi> Wherefore ≈øerue Pictures, but to continue our features? Why doe men bestow ≈øo much cost in ≈øumptuous Buildings, but to leaue a <hi>Monument</hi> of their Magnificence? To what end doe we erect Holy-hou≈øes and Ho≈øpitalls, but to po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe mens mindes with the Deuotion of our Soules? And ≈øhall wee ble≈øse a <hi>King,</hi> when wee behold him in his <hi>Po≈øteritie!</hi> Shall wee admire his features, when wee contemplate them in his <hi>Pictures!</hi> Shall we wonder at his <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence,</hi> when we gaze vpon it in his ≈øtately <hi>Edifices!</hi> and may wee not as well bee raui≈øhed, when wee ≈øee his ≈øharpe Wit, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Judgement, his infinite Memorie, his Excellent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in his admirable <hi>Writings?</hi> Certainely it is a peruer≈ønes to esteeme a man least, for that whereby hee liues the longest; to value him more for the outward worke of his hand, then for the inward operation of his minde; to esteeme him more for that which instructs but little, then for that which ≈øhall edifie for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. What now remaines of <hi>Cae≈øar</hi> ≈øo famous as his <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries?</hi> What of <hi>Cicero,</hi> as his <hi>Orations?</hi> How comes <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtotle</hi> to be of more authoritie then <hi>Alexander?

            <p>Hauing now deliuered my opinion, that J thinke it neither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull nor inconuenient for a <hi>King</hi> to write, but that he hath the Liberty that other men haue, if hee can get the ley≈øure; to ≈øhew his abilities for the pre≈øent, to perpetuate his Memory to <hi>Po≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> to aduance his prai≈øe before his owne People, and gaine Glory from others; but e≈øpecially to giue <hi>Glory</hi> vnto <hi>GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>J will craue leaue to de≈øcend to an other Con≈øideration: for it may be, there will not be ≈øo much fault found with a <hi>King</hi> for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as for the matter or Subiect whereof he treates: For <hi>Per≈øona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> of their eminent Degree and <hi>State,</hi> mu≈øt not ≈øpend their paines on poore purpo≈øes; nor write ≈øo much to try their witts
<pb facs="tcp:23110:14"/>on triuiall thinges, as to winne them≈øelues Honor by the Excellency of their ≈øubiect. Jndeed, if I were worthy to adui≈øe a <hi>King,</hi> hee ≈øhould meddle very ≈øparingly, and but vpon important Cau≈øes, with <hi>Polemicalls:</hi> Hee ≈øhould not often fight but in the field; for put the ca≈øe a <hi>King</hi> writ neuer ≈øo mode≈øtly, that there be not in a whole Booke one word <hi>ad hominem,</hi> nor any touch of his Aduer≈øary in any per≈øonall infirmity; yet J know not how it comes to pa≈ø≈øe, that in all Controuer≈øies, a ≈øolide an≈øwere to an argument, is a very ≈øufficient occa≈øion to make an Aduer≈øary wonderfull angrie. And ≈øo long as there are diuer≈øity of Opinions, there will neuer want matter for Confutations. And in the≈øe Replications the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of a <hi>King</hi> is more expo≈øed and lyes more open, then the per≈øon of a poore Scholler can doe; for as he is a farre greater marke, ≈øo he may farre more ea≈øily be hit: And though they mi≈ø≈øe him and can hit vpon nothing iu≈øtly to bee reprehended in him; yet they doe thinke it <hi>Operaepretium,</hi> to make a Scarre in the face of a <hi>King;</hi> Whereas on the contrary, if a <hi>King</hi> doe write of <hi>Piety</hi> or <hi>Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> compile a <hi>Hi≈øtory,</hi> giue <hi>Precepts</hi> of <hi>Policy,</hi> handle Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, or treate of ≈øome rare Experiences of Nature; wee doe in the≈øe things commend his Iudgement, admire his parts without any euill cogitation against his Per≈øon. There can hardly be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a more viue Example in this ca≈øe, then is to be found in the <hi>Writings</hi> of his <hi>Maie≈øtie.</hi> When the <hi>King</hi> had publi≈øhed his <hi>Ba≈øilicon-Doron,</hi> a Booke ≈øo ≈øingularly penned; that a Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granat is not ≈øo full of kernells, as that is of Excellent <hi>Coun≈øells:</hi> What applau≈øe had it in the world? How did it inflame mens minds to a loue and admiration of his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> beyond mea≈øure; In≈øomuch that comming out iust at the time his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> came in, it made the hearts of all his people as one Man, as much to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him for Religion and Learning, as to obey him for Title and Authoritie; and gaue vs then a ta≈øte, or rather the first fruits, of that we haue ≈øince reaped a plentifull Harue≈øt of, by his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> mo≈øt prudent and Gracious Gouernment ouer vs. The like I may ≈øay of his <hi>Maie≈øties Demonologie;</hi> a rare peece for many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Experiments, both in <hi>Diuinitie</hi> and Naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophie.
<pb facs="tcp:23110:14"/>Jn the≈øe, there was nothing heard of, but Sunne-≈øhine and faire-weather; euery countenance ≈øweet and ≈ømiling vpon them: But as ≈øoone as his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> dealt against the <hi>Pope,</hi> tooke the <hi>Cardinall</hi> in hand, made the world ≈øee the v≈øurped power of the one, and Sophi≈øtry of the other; Good Lord, what a ≈øtirre we had; what roaring of the wilde Bulls of <hi>Ba≈øan,</hi> what a commotion in euery Countrey; Jn≈øomuch, that I thinke, there is ≈øcarce a People, Language or Nation in <hi>Chri≈øtendome,</hi> out of which his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> hath not receiued ≈øome an≈øwere or other; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by way of re≈øuting, or at lea≈øt by rayling: So that, had not the <hi>King</hi> contemned and made him≈øelfe ≈øport and recreation by ≈øuch kinde of Reuelling, rather then bene mooued to pa≈øsion; It could not haue bene but a marueilous perturbation to a <hi>Prince</hi> of ≈øo exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite ≈øen≈øe and vnder≈øtanding.

And the better to induce you to bee of my minde; I will make vnto you a trew Relation of his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> entering into this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and then leaue it to your con≈øideration; whether there were not a <hi>Diuine hand,</hi> that led his into it, or no. Jt is the Speach of our Ble≈ø≈øed <hi>Sauiour,</hi> that there is nothing hid, that ≈øhall not be knowne; and what is ≈øpoken in darkene≈ø≈øe, ≈øhall be heard in the Light: This his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> as him≈øelfe confe≈ø≈øeth, found trew in the comming foorth of one of his Bookes; and I thinke it may bee found as trew in the comming foorth of ≈øome other of them. For after the <hi>Pope</hi> had put forth his <hi>Breues,</hi> and the <hi>Cardinall</hi> had ≈øent his Letters to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie≈øt; the one to enioyne the People not to take the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,</hi> affirming they could not take it with ≈øafety of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation;
<pb facs="tcp:23110:15"/>the other to reproue the Arch-priest for that hee had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, and to draw him to a penitencie for ≈øo foule a Lap≈øe: His <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> like as became a Prudent and a Religious <hi>Prince,</hi> thought it not meete, that the≈øe things ≈øhould pa≈øse for current, but that it was expedient his People ≈øhould know, that the taking of this <hi>Oath</hi> was ≈øo farre from endangering their Soules, as that it intended nothing but ciuill Obedience, and without touching any point of their con≈øcience, made the <hi>State</hi> ≈øecure of their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. To performe this worke, his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> thought the <hi>Bi≈øhop</hi> of <hi>Winche≈øter</hi> that then was, a very fit man, both for his ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Learning, as for that he had long laboured in an Argument not much of a diuers nature from this: Whereupon his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> calling for penne and incke, to giue my L. of <hi>Winche≈øter</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, how and in what maner to proceed in this Argument, I know not how it came to pa≈ø≈øe; but it fell out trew, that the <hi>Poet</hi> ≈øaith,

                  <l>In≈øtitui, currente rota, po≈øt vrceus exit.</l>
               </q> For the <hi>Kings</hi> Penne ranne ≈øo fa≈øt, that in the compa≈øse of ≈øixe dayes, his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> had accompli≈øhed that, which hee now calleth his <hi>Apologie;</hi> which when my Lord of <hi>Canterburie</hi> that then was, and my Lord of <hi>Elie</hi> had peru≈øed, being indeed deliuered by his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> but as briefe Notes, and in the nature of a Minute to bee explicated by the <hi>Bi≈øhop</hi> in a larger <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>olume; yet they thought it ≈øo ≈øufficient an An≈øwere both to the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> as there needed no other: Whereupon his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded, to giue way to the comming of it foorth, but was plea≈øed to conceale his Name: And ≈øo haue wee the <hi>Apologie</hi> beyond his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> owne purpo≈øe or determination.</p>
            <p>After that the <hi>Apologie</hi> was out, his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> diuer≈øe times would bee plea≈øed to vtter a Re≈øolution of his; that if the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardinall</hi> would not rest in his an≈øwere, and ≈øit downe by it; take the <hi>Oath</hi> as it was intended for a point of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and Ciuill Obedience; Hee would publi≈øh the <hi>Apologie</hi> in his owne name with a <hi>Preface</hi> to all the <hi>Princes</hi> in <hi>Chri≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:23110:15"/>wherein hee would publi≈øh ≈øuch a Confe≈øsion of his Faith, per≈øwade the <hi>Princes</hi> ≈øo to vindicate their owne Power, di≈øcouer ≈øo much of the <hi>My≈øterie</hi> of Jniquitie vnto them; as the <hi>Popes Bulles</hi> ≈øhould pull in their hornes, and him≈øelfe wi≈øh he had neuer medled with this matter. The <hi>Cardinall</hi> contending against the <hi>Apologie,</hi> his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> confirmed his Re≈øolution, and with the like Celerity, in the compa≈ø≈øe of one weeke, wrote his <hi>Monitory-Preface:</hi> for as <hi>Hirtius</hi> ≈øaid of <hi>Cae≈øars Comentaries, Qua foelicitate</hi> they were done, let others iudge; but <hi>Qua celeritate,</hi> J can tell: And being ≈øo written, publi≈øhed it and the <hi>Apologie</hi> in his owne Name; and made good his word, ≈øent it to the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> and all the <hi>Kings</hi> and free <hi>Princes</hi> in <hi>Chri≈øtendome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now hauing made this Relation, wherein J haue deliuered nothing but trewth; Let me offer vnto you ≈øome few things worthy Con≈øideration.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, that vpon the comming foorth of that Booke, there were no <hi>States,</hi> that di≈øauowed the Doctrine of it in that point of the <hi>Kings</hi> power; And the <hi>Venetians</hi> mainetained it in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and put it in Execution; The <hi>Sorbons</hi> maintained it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, their owne writers, that oppo≈øed it, ≈øo ouerla≈øhed, as they were corrected and castigated of men of their owne Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Becanus</hi> his Booke corrected by the <hi>Cardinalles</hi> of <hi>Rome; Bellarmines</hi> Booke burnt in <hi>Paris; Suarez</hi> his An≈øwere burnt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo in <hi>France.</hi> As for the Raylers, I leaue them to God his Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who≈øe hand hath bene vpon the mo≈øt of them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> Confe≈øsion of faith, hath bene ≈øo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally approued, as it hath conuerted many of their partie: And had it not bene (as J haue bene informed by diuer≈øe) for the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øe of <hi>Antichri≈øt,</hi> many more would ea≈øily haue bene induced, to ≈øub≈øcribe to all in that <hi>Preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> haue by his <hi>Maie≈øties Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,</hi> had a more cleare in≈øight, and a more perfect di≈øcouery into the Iniury offered them by the <hi>Pope</hi> in the point of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Power, then euer they had; Jn≈øomuch, as that point was
<pb facs="tcp:23110:16"/>neuer ≈øo throughly di≈øputed in <hi>Chri≈øtendome,</hi> as it hath bene by the occa≈øion of his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> Booke.</p>
            <p>Fiftly and lastly, for the point of <hi>Antichri≈øt;</hi> I haue heard many confe≈ø≈øe, that they neuer ≈øaw ≈øo much light giuen to that <hi>My≈øterie,</hi> neuer de≈øcerned ≈øo much trewth by the vniforme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of the Text, and ≈øtrength of Interpretation of places, as they haue done by his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> Booke. So that, though Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer≈øies be fitter ≈øubiects for Schollers ordinarily, then for <hi>Kings;</hi> Yet when there was ≈øuch a nece≈øsitie in vndertaking, and ≈øuch a ≈øucce≈ø≈øe being performed; I leaue it to the world to iudge, whether there were not a ≈øpeciall hand of <hi>GOD</hi> in it, or no. Now ≈øince I haue begunne with this point of <hi>Antichri≈øt,</hi> J will make bolde to proceed a little with his <hi>Maie≈øties Paraphra≈øe</hi> vpon the <hi>Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> wherein that Treati≈øe of <hi>Antichri≈øt</hi> is principally grounded.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> ≈øingular vnderstanding in all points of good Learning is not vnknowne: But yet aboue all other things, <hi>GOD</hi> hath giuen him an vnderstanding Heart in the Interpretation of that <hi>Booke,</hi> beyond the mea≈øure of other men: For this <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phra≈øe,</hi> that leades the way to all the rest of his <hi>Maie≈øties Workes,</hi> was written by his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> before hee was twenty yeeres of aage; and therefore iustly in this <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>olume hath the first place, the rest following in order according to the time of their first penning. Anciently <hi>Kings</hi> drempt dreames, and ≈øaw vi≈øions; and <hi>Prophets</hi> expounded them: So with <hi>King Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> So with <hi>Nabuchodono≈øor</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Babylon.</hi> Jn this aage, <hi>Prophets</hi> haue written <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>i≈øions, and <hi>Kings</hi> haue expounded them. <hi>GOD</hi> rai≈øed vp <hi>Prophets</hi> to deliuer his People from a temporall captiuitie in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> by the Jnterpretation of the one; And <hi>GOD</hi> hath in this aage ≈øtirred vp <hi>Kings</hi> to deliuer his People from a Spirituall <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the Interpretation of the other. It is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeruable thing, that <hi>GOD</hi> neuer made his People any great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe, but he added vnto his promi≈øe a famous <hi>Prophecie.</hi> Three great promi≈øes we reade of, that runne through all the Scriptures.
<pb facs="tcp:23110:16"/>The first of the <hi>Me≈ø≈øiah;</hi> the ≈øecond of the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> the third of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of Heauen: To the≈øe three promi≈øes, are reduced all the <hi>Prophecies.</hi> Of the promi≈øe of the <hi>Me≈ø≈øiah,</hi> prophecied all the <hi>Prophets</hi> from the fall of the fir≈øt <hi>Adam,</hi> to the comming of the ≈øecond: Of the promi≈øe of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> prophecied <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Io≈øeph,</hi> and the rest, from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to the po≈ø≈øe≈øsing of it by <hi>Io≈øuah</hi> and the children of <hi>I≈ørael:</hi> Of the promi≈øe of the Kingdome of Heauen, made by our <hi>Sauiour CHRIST',</hi> prophecied the <hi>Apo≈øtles;</hi> principally <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in the Reuelation. Now though all were to lay hold on the promi≈øes; yet few were able to vnder≈øtand the <hi>Prophecies.</hi> And ≈øurely, though all the people of <hi>GOD</hi> are to lay hold on the promi≈øes of that Glorious <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> de≈øcribed in that Booke; yet few are able to vnder≈øtand the <hi>Prophecies</hi> therein contained, comprehending in them a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Hi≈øtory</hi> and <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> euen from the de≈øtruction of <hi>Ieru≈øalem,</hi> till the con≈øummation of the whole world. Yet this I thinke, I may ≈øafely ≈øay; That <hi>Kings</hi> haue a kinde of interest in that Booke beyond any other: for as the execution of the mo≈øt part of the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of that Booke is committed vnto them; So it may be, that the Interpretation of it, may more happily be made by them: And ≈øince they are the principall Instruments, that <hi>GOD</hi> hath de≈øcribed in that Booke to destroy the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Antichri≈øt,</hi> to con≈øume his State and Citie; I ≈øee not, but it may ≈øtand with the Wi≈øedome of <hi>GOD,</hi> to in≈øpire their heart to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it; into who≈øe handes hee hath put it to excute, vntill the <hi>LORD</hi> ≈øhall con≈øume both him and it with the Spirit of his mouth, and ≈øhall aboli≈øh it with the brightne≈ø≈øe of his comming: For from the day that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> writ the Booke to this pre≈øent houre; I doe not thinke that euer any <hi>King</hi> tooke ≈øuch paines, or was ≈øo perfect in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> as his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> is; which will ea≈øily appeare by this <hi>Paraphra≈øe,</hi> by his <hi>Maie≈øties Meditation</hi> on the <hi>20.</hi> Chap. and his <hi>Monitorie Preface.</hi> Jt was my purpo≈øe to haue past through all his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> Books; to haue expre≈ø≈øed the Argument and the occa≈øion of their writing; But I find by that J haue already
<pb facs="tcp:23110:17"/>≈øaid, I ≈øhould be ouer tedious vnto you. This therefore in generall; They are all worthy of a <hi>King,</hi> and to be kept to Po≈øterity: For if <hi>Ouid</hi> could imagine, that no time ≈øhould eate out the memory of his <hi>Metamorpho≈øeis,</hi> which were but fictions; J hope no time ≈øhall ≈øee an end of the≈øe Books, that carry in them ≈øo much diuine trewth and light. And as in this first worke of the <hi>Paraphra≈øe,</hi> his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> hath ≈øhewed his <hi>Piety;</hi> So in this la≈øt <hi>Pearle</hi> (I meane <hi>his Maie≈øties Speach in the Starr-Chamber</hi>) his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> hath ≈øhewed his <hi>Policy:</hi> The fir≈øt ≈øheweth, hee vnder≈øtands the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>GOD;</hi> this la≈øt, that hee as well apprehends the State of his <hi>Kingdomes</hi> in this <hi>World:</hi> The first ≈øheweth him to haue a large Portion in that of Heauen; and this la≈øt ≈øheweth him to haue a great Power and experience in the≈øe <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes</hi> hee hath on earth. Therefore, let the≈øe men, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light ≈øo much in Detraction and to vilify him, whom <hi>GOD</hi> hath exalted; and to ≈øhed his blood, who≈øe Soule <hi>GOD</hi> hath bound vp in the Bundle of life; Let them, J ≈øay, write what euer the Subtilty of the olde <hi>Serpent</hi> can put into their heads, or the Malice of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> infu≈øe into their hearts; Let them ≈øpeake, what the poy≈øon of <hi>A≈øpes</hi> is able to put into their lippes; they are not all able to make his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> to appeare le≈ø≈øe then he is, nor to ≈øhew, that euer they had of theirs a <hi>King</hi> ≈øo accompli≈øhed. It is trew, that wee haue not had many <hi>Kings</hi> in this <hi>Kingdome</hi> of our Profe≈øsion: But for tho≈øe we haue had, this <hi>Iland</hi> of ours neuer ≈øaw the like, either for partes of Nature, giftes of Learning or Graces of <hi>Piety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The little time of life, that God lent to <hi>King Edward,</hi> must needs le≈ø≈øen his pray≈øes; But neuer did there appeare beginnings of more rare perfection, then in him.</p>
            <p>The length of <hi>Queene Elizabeths</hi> dayes, together with the felicity of her time, was not only a Glory to her owne People, but a wonderment to the World, euen our Aduer≈øaries, as <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øaid, being <hi>Iudges.</hi> And pray≈øed be <hi>GOD,</hi> the pre≈øent time pa≈ø≈øeth a long with the like felicity and much more Securitie: for let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a little, for the Glory of <hi>GOD</hi> and encouragement of his
<pb facs="tcp:23110:17"/>
               <hi>Maie≈øtie,</hi> to goe on in his happie Cour≈øe begunne, the Ble≈øsings of <hi>GOD</hi> we receiue by him; And then let our Aduer≈øaries tell vs, whether we be a mi≈øerable People or no, as ≈øome of late haue gone about to per≈øwade vs. Neither doe J ≈øtand in feare of any mans reprehen≈øion; for J will ≈øpeake nothing but trewth, and I haue my <hi>Pre≈øident</hi> from <hi>GOD</hi> his owne Booke; wherein the good Actes of euery good <hi>King</hi> are to their eternall prai≈øes trewly recounted.</p>
            <p>First to beginne with <hi>Religion,</hi> as the Generall to the Armie: Of all Gods Ble≈øsings wee haue it without any alteration or change contynued vnto vs. His <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> fir≈øt Care was for the Confirmation of the Go≈øpell: for at his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> fir≈øt comming in; who knowes not the endeauours of men, to haue made a change, either to the <hi>Papi≈øts,</hi> or to the <hi>Puritanes?</hi> His <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtie</hi> therefore, to quiet the <hi>State</hi> and Peace of the Church, called a Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court;</hi> where pa≈øsing ouer the one, as being neuer in his heart to giue the lea≈øt way vnto; He ≈øo tempered the other, as the Harmony hath bene the better euer ≈øince.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Religion</hi> thus ratified; His <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> next Care was for the Tran≈ølation of the <hi>Bible,</hi> it being the ground of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: His <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> was de≈øirous his People ≈øhould haue it in as much perfection, as the Jndu≈øtrie and Labors of the best Learned were able to afford it them.</p>
            <p>Hauing done what was nece≈ø≈øary for the Spirituall part of the Church, his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> tooke into con≈øideration the Temporal State thereof: No ≈øooner came the <hi>Parliament,</hi> but finding what ≈øpoile had bene made of the Lands thereof in the tyme of his <hi>Predece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øors,</hi> by a libertie they had to take the Landes of the Church for a longer Terme then others could doe; Cut him≈øelfe off from that libertie, and equalled him≈øelfe to a common per≈øon in the taking of any State in the Churches Landes.</p>
            <p>When his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> had done this in <hi>England,</hi> he looked backe into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and reforming the State of the Church there, as farre as in his <hi>Princely-Wi≈øedome</hi> he thought conuenient for the time; re≈øtored the <hi>Bi≈øhops</hi> there, as to their Spirituall <hi>Keies;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:23110:18"/>≈øo to their temporall <hi>E≈øtates,</hi> though it were to the great lo≈ø≈øe and dammage of his owne Reuennue and <hi>Crowne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Scotland</hi> his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> came to <hi>Ireland,</hi> that forlorne <hi>Kingdome</hi> both for Temporall and Spiritual e≈øtate, till be looked into it: There his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> hath reduced the <hi>Bi≈øhoppricks,</hi> not only to their old Rents; but added vnto them many new <hi>Reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues;</hi> ≈øo that many places there are an≈øwerable to the be≈øt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings here: Neither hath his Care bene onely on the≈øe high places of the Church, but hath de≈øcended to the lowest in the ≈øame, hauing both protected the <hi>Benefices</hi> from being ray≈øed to any higher Taxe, and hindred all cour≈øes, that might giue his Cleargie mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtation or trouble.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Maie≈øties Bountie</hi> hath not bene wanting to Colledges and Ho≈øpitalls, hauing parted with his owne Tenures, to giue them power of larger Indowments; whereby there hath bene works of more ≈øumptuou≈ønes and co≈øt done in his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> time, then there hath bene in any one aage before.</p>
            <p>J may not forget one thing, that ≈øince his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> comming to this <hi>Crowne,</hi> he hath neuer put into his Coffers the meane prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitts of any Eccle≈øia≈øticall liuing, but hath bene a <hi>Fidus-Depo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius,</hi> and euer giuen them to the next Jncumbent.</p>
            <p>Let me de≈øcend a little from the≈øe workes of <hi>Piety</hi> to <hi>Peace.</hi> Neuer hath there bene ≈øo vniuer≈øall a Peace in <hi>Chri≈øtendome</hi> ≈øince the time of our <hi>Sauiour Chri≈øt,</hi> as in the≈øe his Dayes: And I dare ≈øay, as much, if not more, by the procurement of his <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtie,</hi> then by any other earthly meanes in this world. A <hi>Peace</hi> (to let forraigne partes pa≈ø≈øe) ≈øo entertayned at home; that in his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> three <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> apt enough by con≈øtitution, and not vnaccu≈øtomed by practi≈øe to be at variance, there hath bene no Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill di≈ø≈øen≈øion at all. With <hi>Peace GOD</hi> hath giuen vs Plentie: So that, if Peace and Plenty haue not made vs too too wanton, I know not what wee want. Neither is there any crying out for lacke of <hi>Iu≈øtice</hi> in our <hi>Courtes;</hi> for neuer was there Iustice ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtred with more liberty from the <hi>King,</hi> nor more vprightnes from the Judges; And yet in the free di≈øpen≈øation of <hi>Iu≈øtice,
<pb facs="tcp:23110:18"/>Mercie</hi> did neuer more triumph. If this bee to bee mi≈øerable, J know not what on earth they call Happine≈ø≈øe: <hi>GOD</hi> continue the≈øe ≈øtill vnto vs; and then, let them call Happine≈ø≈øe, what they plea≈øe.</p>
            <p>But I know wherefore all is mi≈øerable; becau≈øe there is no more Mercy ≈øhewed to their <hi>Catholiks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>J will put it as a <hi>Crowne</hi> vpon all his <hi>Maie≈øties Mercies:</hi> There was neuer <hi>King,</hi> that had ≈øo great a cau≈øe giuen him, that euer tooke ≈øo little bloode, extending his Mercy to all, that were not per≈øonall workers in that <hi>Powder-Plot:</hi> And before that you had hatched that Mon≈øter, neither was the per≈øon or pur≈øe of any your reputed Catholicks touched. And ≈øince that time, you may doe well to complaine of your Mi≈øeries; but the Church and Comonwealth both, doe trauaile and groane vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of your di≈øobedience: But the worst J wi≈øh you, is, that at length by his <hi>Maie≈øties</hi> long <hi>Patience,</hi> you may bee drawne to Repentance; for as we are come out from you, lest we ≈øhould bee partakers of your plagues; ≈øo we pray for you, that you may come in to vs, that you may be participants of our felicities.</p>
            <p>To Conclude this <hi>Preface: GOD</hi> hath giuen vs a <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>GOD</hi> aboue all things gaue <hi>Solomon</hi> Wi≈øedome; Wi≈øedome brought him peace; Peace brought him Riches; Riches gaue him Glory. His wi≈øedome appeared in his wordes and <hi>Workes:</hi> his Peace, he pre≈øerued by the power of his Army: His riches he ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, as by his Reuennue, ≈øo by the Trade of his Nauie: His Glory did accrue from them all. Now, as in the≈øe, <hi>GOD</hi> exalted him beyond all the <hi>Kings</hi> that euer were, or ≈øhould be after him; So had he in other things Humiliations not farre behind the proportion of his Exaltations; the fearefullest fall, that the Scripture affords an Example of; the most vnchast life and immoderate exce≈ø≈øe of <hi>Women,</hi> that we read of; the weakest Posterity for Wi≈øedome and Gouernment, that we finde in all the Line of his Succe≈øsion. <hi>GOD</hi> would haue it ≈øo, that he ≈øhould no more be ≈øet out, as a Type of the <hi>Glory</hi> of his owne <hi>Sonne</hi> in the felicity of his State one way, then he would haue him propo≈øed as a patterne of Humane
<pb facs="tcp:23110:19"/>frailty an other way. Therefore, though we may not approach him in his Typicall State; yet <hi>GODS</hi> Name be ble≈øsed, that hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs to goe farre beyond him in his per≈øonall Condition: For we haue already, ble≈ø≈øed be <hi>GOD,</hi> ≈øeene the Con≈øtancie and per≈øeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his <hi>Maie≈øty</hi> in his Holy Profe≈øsion, without any <hi>Eclip≈øe</hi> or Shaddow of change, longer then we are well able to deduce the whole life and reigne of <hi>Solomon.</hi> We haue not the Daughter of <hi>Pharao</hi> an Idolatrous <hi>King;</hi> nor feare we ≈øtrange women to ≈øteale away his heart from the Seruice of <hi>GOD:</hi> But a <hi>Queene,</hi> as of a <hi>Royall,</hi> ≈øo of a Religious Stocke, profe≈øsing the Go≈øpell of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> with him; A <hi>Mirrour</hi> of trew Modestie, a <hi>Queene</hi> of Bounty, both beloued and admired of all his People: A <hi>Po≈øterity</hi> that we need not feare for folly in the one Sexe, nor for leuitie in the other; Both which made <hi>Solomon</hi> ≈øpeake ≈øo much, (as the <hi>Iewes</hi> ≈øay) in his <hi>Prouerbes,</hi> of a fooli≈øh ≈øonne, becau≈øe his owne was not wi≈øe, and of wanton Women, becau≈øe he feared the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his owne Daughters. But <hi>GOD</hi> hath left his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> a <hi>Sonne;</hi> a <hi>Prince,</hi> as in outward <hi>Liniaments,</hi> ≈øo in inward <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments,</hi> (I need ≈øay no more) an <hi>Alter-Idem,</hi> a ≈øecond-Selfe; A <hi>Daughter,</hi> a <hi>Prince≈ø≈øe</hi> of that Piety, ≈øingular vertue and Modestie; as makes her both beloued at home and admired abroad. J haue done: Only I de≈øire the <hi>Readers</hi> of the≈øe <hi>Workes,</hi> to pray to <hi>GOD,</hi> that as he hath ≈øo farre aduanced vs, as to bestowe vpon vs, with the Heauenly Trea≈øures of his trewth, the riches of his earthly <hi>Iewels</hi> in ≈øo <hi>Sacred</hi> a <hi>King,</hi> ≈øo admired a <hi>Queene,</hi> ≈øo hopefull a <hi>Prince,</hi> ≈øo vertuous a <hi>Princes;</hi> He would for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ≈øake, for his Sonnes ≈øake, continue this the Light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance vpon vs in them and their <hi>Po≈øterity,</hi> till the comming of that <hi>Kingdome,</hi> which neuer ≈øhall haue end. <hi>AMEN.</hi>

J doubt not but it will ≈øeeme ≈øtrange to many, that any of my aage, calling, and litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ≈øhould haue medled with ≈øo ob≈øcure, Theologicall, and high a ≈øubiect: But let my earnest de≈øire (by manifesting the Trueth,) as well to teach my ≈øelfe as others, ≈øerue for excu≈øe; con≈øidering al≈øo that where diuers others in our aage, haue medled with the interpretation of this Booke, pre≈øsing with preoccupied opinions, onely to wrest and conforme the meaning thereof to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and priuate pa≈øsions; J by the contrary prote≈øt, that all my trauailes tend to ≈øquare and conforme my opinions to the trew and ≈øincere meaning thereof: Which cau≈øes mooued me to vndertake this worke; not thereby to de≈øpi≈øe infinite others, who to the glory
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23110:21"/>of God, and great comfort of his Church, hath giuen it a great light already, but rather that by oft peru≈øing and dew con≈øidering therof, whereto this worke hath led mee, J might be the better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the meaning of this Booke, which J e≈øteeme a ≈øpeciall cannon against the Hereticall wall of our common aduer≈øaries the Papists: whom I would wi≈øh to know, that in this my <hi>Paraphra≈øe</hi> vpon it, J haue v≈øed nothing of my owne coniecture, or of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of others, but onely haue interpreted it, in that ≈øen≈øe which may best agree with the methode of the Epistle, and not bee contradictorie to it ≈øelfe: The meaning whereof I expound, partly by it ≈øelfe, and partly by other parts of the Scriptures, as the worke it ≈øelfe will beare witne≈ø≈øe: And therefore this one thing J must craue of our Aduer≈øaries, that they will not refute any part of my Interpretation, till they finde out a more probable them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues, agreeing with the whole context, <hi>&amp; cum ≈øerie tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi> and where their con≈øciences beare them witne≈ø≈øe that J ≈øpeake the Trueth, that they will yeeld vnto it, and glorifie God therein, and this is all the reward I craue for my paines. But of one thing I must forewarne you (Chri≈øtian Readers) <hi>to wit,</hi> that yee may vnder≈øtand, that it is for the making of the Di≈øcour≈øe more ≈øhort and facile, that I haue made <hi>IOHN</hi> to be the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in all this <hi>Paraphra≈øe;</hi> and not that I am ≈øo pre≈øumptuou≈øly fooli≈øh, as to haue meant thereby, that my <hi>Paraphra≈øe</hi> is the onely trew and certaine expo≈øition of this Epi≈øtle, reiecting all others: For although through ≈øpeaking in his per≈øon, I am onely bounded and limitted to v≈øe one, and not diuers interpretations, of euery ≈øeuerall place; yet I condemne not others, but rather allow them to interpret it diuer≈øly, ≈øo being, it agree with the analogie of faith, with the methode of the Text, <hi>&amp; cum ≈øerie temporum,</hi> as I ≈øaid before: for tho≈øe three being ob≈øerued, it may fall out that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, diuer≈øly expound one place, and yet all be according to the trueth, and very meaning of the Spirit of God, as may ea≈øily be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Text it ≈øelfe: For in the 17. Chapter the Angel expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Iohn,</hi> the ≈øeuen heads of the bea≈øtes that came out of the Sea, hee ≈øaith the ≈øeuen heads which thou ≈øawest vpon the beast

                  <hi>Gnarma &amp; Geddon</hi> which may very well agree with the Hi≈øtory, becau≈øe it is the name of the place, ≈øaith <hi>Iohn,</hi> where the wicked being a≈øsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together by the alluring and deceipt of Satan, and his three ≈øpirits of Diuels to make warre with the faithfull, were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed by God, and ≈øo their de≈øtruction came, and was procured by deceipt; Yet others interpret it to ≈øignifie <hi>de≈øtruction by waters,</hi> as compo≈øed of <gap reason="foreign">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Booke or Epi≈øtle of <hi>Reuelation,</hi> was called in doubt, a≈øwell for the incertaintie of the Author, as al≈øo for the canonicalne≈øse of the Booke it ≈øelfe, by ≈øundry of the ancients, and ≈øpecially by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øebe;</hi> For ≈øoluing whereof I need not to in≈øist, ≈øince it is both receiued now of all Christians, and al≈øo diuers of the Neoteriques, in ≈øpeciall <hi>Beza</hi> in his Preface vpon it, hath handled that matter ≈øufficiently alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; So that this doubt onely rests now in men, that this Booke is ≈øo ob≈øcure and allegorique, that it is in a maner vnprofitable to be taught or interpreted; Whereunto I will ≈øhortly make an≈øwere, and then goe forward to ≈øet downe the methode of the ≈øame: And therefore to make a deduction from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, let vs vnderstand in what ≈øeuerall or principall parts the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may be diuided in; and then which of them this Booke is. How ≈øoone <hi>Adam</hi> being made perfect in his Creation, and hauing the choi≈øe of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death, Good</hi> and <hi>Euill,</hi> did by his horrible defection make choi≈øe of <hi>Death,</hi> and cast off <hi>Life,</hi> and by that meanes infected his whole posteritie with double ≈øinne, <hi>to wit, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall</hi> and <hi>Actuall,</hi> God notwithstanding had ≈øuch a Loue to mankinde, as being his most Noble workeman≈øhip, and Creature, made to his owne Likene≈ø≈øe and Image, that he ≈øelected a Church amongst them, whom fir≈øt becau≈øe of their weakene≈ø≈øe and incredulitie, he with his owne mouth taught, and next in≈øtructed and rai≈øed vp notable men amongst them to be their Rulers, whom he endued with ≈øuch excellent gifts, as not onely their example in life preached, but al≈øo by Miracles they ≈øtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and confirmed their Faith: But le≈øt this mini≈øtrie of men ≈øhould make them to depend onely vpon their mouthes, forgetting Him, and making Gods of them, he at length out of his owne mouth gaue them his Law, which he cau≈øed them to put in Writ, and retaine ≈øtill amongst them; And then le≈øt they ≈øhould forget and neglect the ≈øame, he rai≈øed vp godly Rulers, a≈ø well Temporall, as Spirituall, who by their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liues and working of Miracles, reuiued and ≈øtrengthened the Law in their hearts.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23110:22"/>But ≈øeeing, that notwith≈øtanding all this, they ca≈øt them≈øelues headlong in the gulfe of vices (≈øuch is the vnthankefull and repining Nature of Man,) hee rai≈øed vp Prophets, as especially <hi>Ieremie</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> to accu≈øe them of their ≈øinnes, and by Vi≈øions to forewarne them of the times to come, whereby the godly might turne and arme them≈øelues, and the wicked might be made inexcu≈øable. And thus much for the Old Te≈øtament. But then God ≈øeeing that notwith≈øtanding this, there crept in ≈øuch a generall corruption amongst them, that ≈øcarce one might be found that bowed not his knee to Baal; Hee then by his vn≈øearchable Wi≈øedome incarnated his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Sonne and Word <hi>THE LORD IESVS,</hi> who by his death and Pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion accompli≈øhed the faith of the Fathers; who≈øe Saluation was by the beleeuing in him to come, as al≈øo made an open and patent way of Grace to all the world there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: And then as vpon a new world, and a new Church, Gods Fatherly care to Mankind was renued, but in a more fauourable forme, becau≈øe hee looked vpon the Merits of his deare Sonne: Then, fir≈øt <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> with his owne mouth did in≈øtruct men, and confirmed his Doctrine by Miracles, and ≈øecondly rai≈øed vp the Apo≈øtles to giue the Law of Faith, confirming it by their liues and Miracles: And la≈øt, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding this Defection was beginning to creepe in againe, hee inspired one of them, <hi>to wit, IOHN</hi> to write this Booke, that hee might thereby, euen as <hi>Ieremie</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> did in the old Law, a≈øwell rebuke them of their ≈øinnes, as by forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, to arme them again≈øt the great tentations that were to come after.

                  <p>Then for the fir≈øt,
<note place="margin">Satan in his in≈øtruments is loo≈øed to trouble the Church.</note> by Satan is meant not onely the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, enemie to Chri≈øt and his Church, but al≈øo with him all the in≈øtruments in whom he ruleth, and by whom he ruleth, and by whom he vttereth his cruell and crafty intentions, ≈øpecially the Antichri≈øt and his Clergie, ioyned with the Dragon before in the 16. Chap. ver≈øe 17. and called the bea≈øt, and the fal≈øe prophet. For as Chri≈øt and his Church are called after one Name, Chri≈øt, by rea≈øon of their mo≈øt ≈øtrait and neere vnion, and heauenly effects flowing there from, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12.

<note place="margin">The thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand yeeres.</note> by rea≈øon of their vnion, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed effects flowing therefrom. The≈øe thou≈øand yeeres, are but a number cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine for an vncertaine, which phra≈øe or maner of ≈øpeaking, is often v≈øed by the Spirit of God in the Scriptures, meaning a great number of yeeres.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer,
<note place="margin">The pri≈øon whereout Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is loo≈øed.</note> the pri≈øon whereout he is loo≈øed, is the hels, which by the Spirit of God are called his pri≈øon, for two cau≈øes: <hi rend="sup">1</hi> One, becau≈øe during the time of this world, at times appointed by God, he is debarred from walking on the earth,
<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.4.

Finally, he is loo≈øed by interruption or hindering, and for the mo≈øt part,
<note place="margin">The loo≈øing of Satan.</note> to the iudgement of men, abolition or ouerthrow of the ≈øincere preaching of the Go≈øpel, the true v≈øe of the Sacraments, which are ≈øeales and pledges of the promi≈øes contained therein, and lawfull exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe of Chri≈øtian di≈øcipline, whereby both Word and Sacraments are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in purity, called in the fir≈øt ver≈øe the great chaine, whereby the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell

So the meaning of all this 7. ver≈øe is this: The diuel, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene bound, and his power in his in≈øtruments hauing bene re≈øtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a long ≈øpace, by the preaching of the Go≈øpel, at the la≈øt he is loo≈øed out of hell by the rai≈øing vp of ≈øo many new errors and notable euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruments, e≈øpecially the Antichri≈øt and his Clergie, who not onely infect the earth a new, but rule al≈øo ouer the whole, through the decrea≈øe of trew doctrine, and the number of the faithfull following it, and the dayly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe of errours, and nations following them, and beleeuing lies hating the trewth, and taking plea≈øure in vnrighteou≈ønes, 2. <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 2.11, 12. And thus farre for Satan his loo≈øing.</p>
                  <p>Now to the next, his doing after he is loo≈øed.
<note place="margin">Satan fir≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth, then allures to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and in the end maketh all his to take armour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Church.</note> Fir≈øt he goeth out to ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce or beguile the nations that are into the foure corners of the earth, and they become his, though in certaine degrees his tyrannie and trauaile appeareth, and bur≈øteth out in ≈øome more then in others: For as all that doe good, are in≈øpired of God thereto, and doe vtter the ≈øame in certaine degrees, according vnto the mea≈øure of grace granted vnto them: ≈øo all that doe euill, are in≈øpired by Satan, and doe vtter the ≈øame in diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, according as that vncleane ≈øpirit taketh po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion in them, and by diuers obiects and meanes, allureth them to doe his will, ≈øome by ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ≈øome by enuie, ≈øome by malice, and ≈øome by feare, and ≈øo forth: and this is the fir≈øt worke.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he gathereth <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> to battell,
<note place="margin">Gog and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog.</note> in number like the ≈øand of the Sea, and ≈øo he and his inclined to battell and blood≈øhed, haue migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie armies, and in number many, inflamed with crueltie. The ≈øpecial heads and rulers of their armies, or rather rankes of their confederats, to goe to battel and to fight, are twaine, here named <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog; Gog</hi> in Hebrew is called Hid, and <hi>Magog</hi> Reuealed, to ≈øignifie that in two ≈øorts of men chiefly Satan ≈øhall vtter him≈øelfe, <hi>to wit,</hi> hypocrites, and auowed or open enemies to God: It is ≈øaid then that Satan ≈øhall in the latter times rule a new ouer the world, who ≈øhall ≈øtirre vp the nations vnder the banners of the≈øe two enemies to God, the hypocriticall and open, to ≈øpread them≈øelues in great multitudes vpon the earth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they ≈øhall a≈øcend vpon the plaine of the earth, pre≈øumptuou≈øly and proudly, bragging of their number and force, and thinking none ≈øhall be able to re≈øi≈øt their rage: They ≈øhall compa≈ø≈øe and be≈øiege the campes of the Saints, and beloued Citie, that is, the handfull of the faithfull beloued of the Lord, again≈øt whome, tru≈øting in their vntellable number, like the ≈øand of the ≈øea, they ≈øhall make a cruell and vnce≈ø≈øable warre.</p>
                  <p>The elect are called Saints and beloued,
<note place="margin">The Elect are the Saints and beloued Citie of God.</note> becau≈øe they are in the loue of God ≈øelected and ≈øeuered out, and by grace engraffed in Chri≈øt, in whom they are counted and found iu≈øtified, ≈øanctified, worthy of loue and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe glorie: Their faithfull fellow≈øhip is compared to Tents, and to a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie beloued, to ≈øignifie their continuall warfare in the earth again≈øt Satan
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:23110:60"/>and ≈øinne, with all his in≈øtruments: their mutual amitie, and friendly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction in loue among them≈øelues, and ioyning together to maintaine the good cau≈øe that their God hath clad them with: but chiefly to ≈øignifie the mightie and al-≈øufficient protection or defence in pro≈øperity and aduer≈øity, flowing from God for their iu≈øt aide again≈øt all powers that can pur≈øue, whereby they al≈øo become faire as the Moone, pure as the Sunne, terrible as an armie with banners, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.6, 9.

                  <p>The ≈øumme then of Satan his doing after he is loo≈øed,
<note place="margin">The ≈øumme of Satan his doing after he is loo≈øed.</note> is this: hee ≈øhall deceiue the nations: he ≈øhall gather an infinite number of hypocrites and open enemies together, inflamed with crueltie, and the≈øe ≈øhall in pridefull pre≈øumption fiercely bend them≈øelues again≈øt the cho≈øen of God, and his trewth profe≈ø≈øed by them. But what at la≈øt ≈øhall the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe be? ≈øurely mo≈øt vnhappy: for fire ≈øhall come downe from heauen and deuoure them, and the diuell that deceiued them, and all his in≈øtruments, chiefly the Bea≈øt and fal≈øe Prophet ≈øhall be ca≈øt in a lake of fire and brim≈øtone,

This time did endure
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:23110:60"/>from Chri≈øt a ≈øpace after <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> his dayes, when the bloodie Sword of per≈øecution cea≈øing, the whole Church began to be defiled with diuers he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øies, which comming vnto a mature and ripe heape, did produce or bring foorth the Antechri≈øt, ≈øignified by the pale hor≈øe in the fourth ≈øeale, by the king of the Locu≈øts in the fift trumpet, by <hi>Babylon</hi> in the 11 and 18. Chapter, by the ≈øecond Bea≈øt ri≈øing out of the ≈øea in the 13. Chapter, and by the woman clad with ≈øcarlet in the 17. chapter. The ari≈øings of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øies, and the Antichri≈øt breeding of their ≈ømoake, is in this place called the loo≈øing of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth after this his loo≈øing, what he doeth:
<note place="margin">The Go≈øpel being hid, the Antichri≈øt beginneth to breed &amp; tend to his height.</note> He deceiueth the nations vniuer≈øally: he gathereth <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> with vntellable armies to fight, he climeth vpon the plaine of the earth, he compa≈ø≈øeth the tents of the Saints, and the beloued Citie about: The≈øe are his doings.</p>
                  <p>Now becau≈øe the≈øe actions are mo≈øt liuely declared in other places of the ≈øame booke, I will ≈øhortly alleadge them to make the matter cleere by conference of places, expounding euery one another. It is ≈øaid in the ninth chapter, that the Antichri≈øt ≈øhall ≈øend out his locu≈øts or Eccle≈øia≈øticall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by faire allurements to entice the world, to yeeld to his and their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable here≈øies, and ≈øhall preuaile ouer the mo≈øt part. It is ≈øaid in the 11. chapter, that he ≈øhall per≈øecute the Saints, kill the two witne≈ø≈øes, and ≈øhall reioyce with the kings of the earth, for their killing, as hauing beene the onely lets to his full glory. It is ≈øaid in the 13. chapter, that he ≈øhall bla≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme God in v≈øurping his power, that by the aduice and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the fal≈øe Prophet, or fal≈øe Church, hee ≈øhall ≈øend out his Images or Emba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours through the world, per≈øecuting and de≈øtroying them that will not obey him and them, and acknowledge his ≈øupremacie; yea, none ≈øhall be ≈øuffered to buy or ≈øell, or v≈øe ciuill ≈øocietie, that acknowledgeth not his ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power and dignity. It is ≈øaid in the 16. chapter, that God plaguing him for the≈øe fore≈øaid abu≈øes, he ≈øhall be ≈øo farre from repentance, as by the contrarie he ≈øhall finde out a new ≈øort of vermin, that is, a new Eccle≈øia≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call order, which are called their frogges, who ≈øhall mooue and entice the Princes of the earth to ioyne with him, and make warre again≈øt the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, pre≈ø≈øing vtterly to de≈øtroy them: and of that battell, and the end ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doeth this place make mention.</p>
                  <p>Now ≈øhortly ioyne all the≈øe together, and ≈øo obtaine the meaning. There ≈øhall ari≈øe an Antichri≈øt and enemie to God and his Church: hee ≈øhall bee head of a fal≈øe and hypocriticall Church: hee ≈øhall claime a ≈øupreme power in earth: he ≈øhall v≈øurpe the power of God: he ≈øhall deceiue men with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bu≈øing locu≈øts: he ≈øhall per≈øecute the faithfull: none ≈øhall bee found that dare openly re≈øi≈øt him: In the end, feeling his kingdome decay, and the trew Church beginning to pro≈øper, he ≈øhall by a new ≈øort of deceiuing ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, gather together the Kings of the earth in great multitudes like the ≈øands of the Sea, and by ioyning or at lea≈øt ≈øuffering of that other great open enemy, he ≈øhall with the≈øe numbers compa≈ø≈øe the campes of the faithfull,

But more largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed in the 132. <hi>P≈øalme,</hi> compo≈øed at the ≈øame time while this worke was a doing. The externall was a notable victorie newly obtained by the power of God ouer and again≈øt the Phili≈øtines, olde and pernitious enemies to the people of God, expre≈ø≈øed in the la≈øt part of the 14. chapter preceding. By this victorie or cau≈øe externall, the internal cau≈øes and zeale in <hi>Dauid</hi> is ≈øo doubly inflamed, that all things ≈øet a≈øide, in this worke onely he will be occupied. The≈øe are the two weightie cau≈øes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him. Wherof we may learne, fir≈øt that the chiefe vertue which ≈øhould be in a chri≈øtian Prince, and which the Spirit of God alwayes chiefly prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes in him, is a feruencie and con≈øtant zeale to promote the glorie of God, that hath honoured him. Next, that where this zeale is vnfained, God leaues neuer that per≈øon, without continuall powring of his ble≈ø≈øings on him, thereby to ≈øtirre vp into him a double mea≈øure of zeale and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe towards God.
<note place="margin">The Church euer troubled by men, hath a ioyfull end.</note> Thirdly, that the Church of God neuer wanted ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and notable victories ouer them, to a≈ø≈øure them at all times of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant kindnes of God towards them; euen, when as by the cro≈ø≈øe, as a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter medicine, he cureth their infirmities, ≈øaueth them from gro≈ø≈øe ≈øinnes, and trieth their faith: For we find plainely in the Scriptures, that no ≈øoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:23110:63"/>God him≈øelfe choo≈øed I≈ørael to be his people; but a≈ø≈øoone, &amp; euer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after as long as they remained his, the diuell ≈øo enuied their pro≈øperity, as hee hounded out his in≈øtruments the nations, at all times to trouble and warre again≈øt them, yet to the comfort of his Church afflicted, and wrack of the afflicters in the end. This fir≈øt was practi≈øed by <hi>Pharao</hi> in Egypt: and after their deliuerance, fir≈øt by the Ammonites, and then by the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øtines continually thereafter, vntill the ri≈øing of the Monarchies, who euery one did exerci≈øe them≈øelues in the ≈øame labour. But to note here the rage of all prophane Princes and nations which exerci≈øed their crueltie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church of God, were ≈øuperfluous and tedious, in re≈øpect of that which I haue ≈øet downe in my former meditation: Wherefore I onely goe forward then in this. As this was the continuall behauiour of the Nations towards I≈ørael; So it was mo≈øt e≈øpecially in the time of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and among the re≈øt at this time here cited; at what time hauing newly inuaded I≈ørael, and beeing driuen backe, they would yet a≈ø≈øemble againe in great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to warre again≈øt the people of God, and not content to defend their owne countries as the I≈øraelites did, would needes come out of the ≈øame to pur≈øue them, and ≈øo ≈øpread them≈øelues in the valley: But <hi>Dauid</hi> by Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, brings foorth the people again≈øt them, who fights, and according to Gods promi≈øes, ouercomes them, onely by the hand of God, and not by their power, as the place it ≈øelfe mo≈øt plainely doeth ≈øhew: So the Church of God may be troubled, but in trouble it cannot peri≈øh; and the end of their trouble is the very wracke and de≈øtruction of Gods enemies.</p>

The Captaines ouer thou≈øands were godly and valiant men, who vnder the King did rule in time of warre, had the cu≈øtodie of the Kings per≈øon, and fought his battailes: The≈øe were nece≈ø≈øarie officers for <hi>Dauid,</hi> who was appointed by God in his time (as wee are taught out of Gods owne words, ≈øpeaking by <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>Dauid</hi>) to fight Gods battailes, to ≈øubdue the enemies of his Church, and to procure by ≈øo doing, a peaceable kingdome

<note place="margin">The Arke is tran≈øported with ioy to Ieru≈øalem.</note> which are the≈øe: The tran≈øporting of the Arke; the harmony of mu≈øicall in≈øtruments; and <hi>Dauids</hi> dancing and reioycing before it. He built a Tabernacle for the Arke in mount <hi>Sion,</hi> &amp; tran≈øported it therunto, to ≈øignify his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes for the many victories God had put in his hands: and this tran≈øpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was the occa≈øion of all this ≈øolemnitie and reioycing that followed thereupon.
<note place="margin">The ≈øignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Arke of the Couenant.</note> As to the Arke it ≈øelfe, we know it was built by <hi>Moy≈øes</hi> at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mand of God, in the wildernes of <hi>Sinai.</hi> This Arke was made of <hi>Shittim</hi> wood, which admits no corruption: It was of mo≈øt comely ≈øhape and forme, two cubits and a halfe in length, a cubit and a halfe in height, and a cubit and a halfe in breadth, ouerlaid within and without with pure beaten gold, and was not only a figure of <hi>Ie≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> our perfect Sauiour, in whom
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:23110:64"/>all the promi≈øes of God, are yea and Amen, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.20. and in whom as a ≈øure Arke, all abundance of Gods ble≈ø≈øings are placed, that out of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe we may all receiue grace vpon grace, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.16. ≈øeeing he is made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs of God, wi≈øedome, righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, ≈øanctification and redemption, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.30. but al≈øo a ≈øure pledge of Gods continuall pre≈øence in Chri≈øt with his people, to ble≈ø≈øe them with all maner of ble≈ø≈øings. And to ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this purpo≈øe more particularly, within the Arke was placed the Tables of the Couenant, and Law written by God, (for which cau≈øe al≈øo it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Arke of the Couenant) <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. to teach them in Chri≈øt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed, the perfection of the whole Law to be found, for all that beleeue in him. Aboue the Arke was a couer or lid called The Mercie Seate, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the lid the figures of two Cherubins, couering with their wings the Mercie Seat: betwixt the which two, the liuing God did louingly ≈øpeake to the in≈øtruction and comfort of his people, to a≈ø≈øure them that all Gods mercifull dealings with man (either in communicating his knowledge to them: or in ≈øending his Angels mini≈øtring Spirits for their comfort,)
<note place="margin">Heb. 1.14. Ioh. 1.4, 11.</note> hath the ground and foundation in CHRIST IESVS eternally. This Arke then being a ≈øure Sacrament of Gods fauour towards them, and a Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of IESVS CHRIST, wherein corporally Gods mercifull promi≈øes did in≈øue; followes the third part, the forme of doing v≈øed therein by the≈øe per≈øons. Generally, the action was to bring vp the Arke of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of the Lord, from the hou≈øe of <hi>Obed Edom</hi> with ioy, and to be placed in the Tabernacle built for it by the King in Mount <hi>Sion.</hi> The forme of doing v≈øed by euery per≈øon, is: The Prie≈øts offer Bullocks and Rammes, becau≈øe that God ble≈ø≈øed the worke; The King clad in a linnen garment, dances and playes before the Arke: <hi>Chenaniah</hi> the chiefe of the ≈øingers with his fellowes, prai≈øes God with P≈øalmes, and all the e≈øtates in I≈ørael, bring the Arke of the Couenant with ≈øhowting, ≈øound of Cornet, Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, cymbals, violes, and harpes, and place it in the citie of Dauid. Briefly then, <hi>Dauid</hi> vpon his victories doeth tran≈øport to his hou≈øe the ≈øame, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtifie hereby his care to receiue Gods fauour towards him and his people: Not thinking it enough to haue once or twi≈øe proofe thereof; but al≈øo to procure a continuance by the pre≈øence of his holy Arke, e≈øteeming this the worthie≈øt trophee or triumph, he could make or erect for his notable victories: A triumph indeed farre ≈øurpa≈øsing the Egyptian Piramides, the Grecian trophees, or yet the Romane triumphall chariots. As to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie and mu≈øicall in≈øtruments that accompanied this holy Arke, I tru≈øt no man is ignorant of the cu≈øtome that was among the Iewes, in prai≈øing. God with all kind of in≈øtruments, as <hi>Dauids</hi> P≈øalmes innumerable times beare witne≈ø≈øe. But in ca≈øe ≈øome would demand wherefore the Church of God ≈øhould more extraordinarily reioyce at one time, then at another, ≈øeeing we are a≈ø≈øured that all Gods actions towards vs, are for our weale, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øpiritually or corporally, ≈øuppo≈øe wee cannot at euery time compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it: I an≈øwere, that although I mu≈øt confe≈ø≈øe that ≈øentence to bee mo≈øt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:23110:65"/>orthodoxe, yet mu≈øt I al≈øo confe≈ø≈øe, that when≈øoeuer it ≈øhall plea≈øe God to manife≈øt by outward ≈øignes to the world, as at one time more then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the great loue to his Church, by ≈øome notable worke for their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; We are then of duty bound in the highe≈øt degree to prai≈øe God, as well for confirming of the weake ones among≈øt vs, as for ≈øtopping of the mouthes, and da≈øhing of the proud wicked without vs, to make the glory of his Name, as farre as in vs lieth, to re≈øound: The manifold examples of the Saints of God through the whole Scriptures prooue this more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently, be≈øides the examples of the prayers of ≈øundry of the godly, who for the glory of his Name, more then for their particular weale, haue pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to giue publike te≈øtimonie of his loue towards them: So did <hi>Mo≈øes, Io≈øhua, Dauid, Elias, Elizeus,</hi> and innumerable others of the Prophets and ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God. As to the dancing of <hi>Dauid:</hi> dancing, playing, and ≈øuch like actions we know are of them≈øelues indifferent, and good or euil accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their v≈øe, and the intention of the v≈øer; and therefore being v≈øed at this time with a comely zeale, for the ≈øetting foorth of Gods glory, are not onely to be borne with and excu≈øed, but euen mo≈øt highly to be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed and commended, although that <hi>Michal</hi> di≈øpray≈øed the ≈øame. Moreouer, it is to be marked that <hi>Dauid</hi> in this doing, did nothing without the ≈øpecial motion of the ≈øpirit of God, as an extraordinarie worke, which ≈øo fully po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed his ≈øoule at this pre≈øent, that forgetfull, as it were, of the actions of his bodie; hee gaue his whole per≈øon ouer to be gouerned as it plea≈øed him, alwayes ≈øeeking in all, the honour and glorie of his God, without re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to him≈øelfe:
<note place="margin">Chri≈øt is the ground of all true Religion.</note> And thus farre for the third part: Whereof wee haue to note fir≈øt in the Arke: The ground of all true and ancient religion, and the body of the whole ≈øeruice of God that brings ≈øaluation, is to bee ≈øituate in Ie≈øus Chri≈øt onely, as is plainely ≈øet downe, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.6. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.7.

My intention in this labour, is onely to prooue two things, as I haue already ≈øaid: The one, that ≈øuch diueli≈øh artes haue bene and are: The other, what exact triall and ≈øeuere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment they merit: and therefore rea≈øon I, What kinde of things are po≈øsible to be performed in the≈øe Arts, and by what naturall cau≈øes they may be, not that I touch euery particular thing of the Diuels power, for that were infinite: but onely to ≈øpeake ≈øchola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtickely, (≈øince this cannot be ≈øpoken in our language) J rea≈øon vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>genus</hi> leauing <hi>≈øpecies,</hi> and <hi>differentia</hi> to bee comprehended therein: As for example, ≈øpeaking of the power of Magiciens, in the fir≈øt booke and ≈øixt Chapter, I ≈øay, that they can ≈øuddenly cau≈øe be brought vnto them, all kinds of daintie di≈øhes, by their familiar ≈øpirit; ≈øince as a thiefe he delights to ≈øteale, and as a ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit he can ≈øubtilly and ≈øuddenly ynough tran≈øport the ≈øame. Now vnder this <hi>genus,</hi> may be comprehended all particulars, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereupon; ≈øuch as the bringing Wine out of a wall (as wee haue heard oft to haue bene practi≈øed) and ≈øuch others; which particulars, are ≈øufficiently prooued by the rea≈øons of the generall. And ≈øuch like in the ≈øecond booke of Witch-craft in ≈øpeciall, and fift Chapter, J ≈øay, and proue by diuers Arguments, that Witches can by the power of their master, cure or cast on di≈øea≈øes: Now by the≈øe ≈øame rea≈øons, that proues their power by the Diuell of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øes in generall, is a≈øwell proued their power in ≈øpecial; as of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the nature of ≈øome men, to make them vnable for women, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:23110:68"/>making it to abound in others, more then the ordinary cour≈øe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would permit: And ≈øuch like in all other particular ≈øickne≈øses. But one thing I will pray thee to ob≈øerue in all the≈øe places, where I rea≈øon vpon the diuels power, which is the different ends and ≈øcopes, that God as the fir≈øt cau≈øe, and the diuell as his in≈øtrument and ≈øecond cau≈øe, ≈øhoots at in all the≈øe actions of the diuel, (as Gods hang-man:) For where the diuels intention in them is euer to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh, either the ≈øoule, or the body, or both of them, that he is ≈øo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to deale with; God by the contrary, drawes euer out of that euill, glory to him≈øelfe, either by the wracke of the wicked in his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice, or by the triall of the patient, and amendment of the faithful, being wakened vp with that rod of correction. Hauing thus decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto thee then, my full intention in this Treati≈øe, thou wilt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øily excu≈øe, I doubt not, a≈øwel my pretermitting, to declare the whole particular rites and ≈øecrets of the≈øe vnlawfull arts; as al≈øo their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit and wonderfull practi≈øes, as being neither of them pertinent to my purpo≈øe: the rea≈øon whereof, is giuen in the hinder end of the first Chapter of the third booke: and who likes to be curious in the≈øe things, he may reade, if he will heare of their practi≈øes, <hi>Bodinus Daemonomanie,</hi> collected with greater diligence, then written with iudgement, together with their confe≈øsions, that haue been at this time apprehended. If he would know what hath bene the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Ancients, concerning their power, he ≈øhall ≈øee it well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed by <hi>Hyperius</hi> &amp; <hi>Hemmingius,</hi> two late Germane wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; Be≈øides innumerable other neotericke Theologues, that write largely vpon that ≈øubject: And if he would know what are the particular rites, and curio≈øities of the≈øe blacke Arts (which is both vnnece≈ø≈øary and perillous) he will finde it in the fourth Booke of <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> and in <hi>Wierus,</hi> whom-of J ≈øpake. And ≈øo wi≈øhing my paines in this Treati≈øe (beloued Reader) to be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, in arming all them that reade the ≈øame, again≈øt the≈øe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue mentioned errours, and recommending my good will to thy friendly acceptation, J bid thee heartily fare-well.</p>

                     <p>Yet if ye will marke the words of the text, yee will finde clearely, that <hi>Saul</hi> ≈øaw that apparition: for giuing you that <hi>Saul</hi> was in another chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, at the making of the circles and coniurations, needfull for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe (as none of that craft wil permit any others to behold at that time) yet it is euident by the text, that how ≈øoone that once that vncleane ≈øpirit was fully ri≈øen, ≈øhe called in vpon <hi>Saul:</hi> For it is ≈øaid in the text, that <hi>Saul knew him to be Samuel,</hi> which could not haue beene, by the hearing tell onely of an olde man with a mantill, ≈øince there was many moe old men dead in <hi>I≈ørael</hi> nor <hi>Samuel:</hi> And the common weid of that whole countrey was mantils.

And that the deuill is permitted at
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:23110:70"/>≈øometimes to put him≈øelfe in the likene≈ø≈øe of the Saints, it is plaine in the Scriptures,
<note place="margin">1.

And as to the diuels foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of things to come, it is true that he knowes not all things future; but yet that hee knowes part, the tragicall euent of this hi≈øtorie declares it, (which the wit of woman could neuer haue fore-≈øpoken) not that hee hath any pre≈øcience, which is onely proper to God; or yet knowes any thing by looking vpon God, as in a mirrour (as the good Angels doe) hee being for euer debarred from the fauourable pre≈øence and countenance of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, but onely by one of the≈øe two meanes: either, as being worldly wi≈øe, and taught by a continuall experience, euer ≈øince the Creation, iudges by likelyhood of things to come, according to the like that hath pa≈ø≈øed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the naturall cau≈øes, in re≈øpect of the vici≈ø≈øitude of all things world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: or el≈øe by Gods imploying of him in a turne, and ≈øo fore≈øeene thereof, as appeares to haue beene in this,
<note place="margin">1.

<note place="margin">Exod. 7. &amp; 2.</note> as we call it.

                     <p>I thinke yee take me to be a Witch my ≈øelfe, or at the lea≈øt would faine ≈øweare your ≈øelfe prenti≈øe to that craft: Alwayes as I may, I ≈øhal ≈øhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øatisfie you, in that kinde of coniurations, which are contained in ≈øuch bookes, which I call the Deuils Schoole: There are foure principall parts: the per≈øons of the coniurers; the action of the coniuration; the words and rites v≈øed to that effect; and the Spirits that are coniured. Ye mu≈øt fir≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to lay the ground, that I tolde you before, which is, that it is no power inherent in the circles, or in the holine≈ø≈øe of the names of God bla≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemou≈øly v≈øed; nor in what≈øoeuer rites or ceremonies at that time v≈øed, that either can rai≈øe any infernall ≈øpirit, or yet limitate him perforce with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in or without the≈øe circles. For it is he onely, the father of all lies, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing fir≈øt of all pre≈øcribed that forme of doing, feining him≈øelfe to be commanded and re≈øtrained thereby, will be loth to pa≈ø≈øe the boundes of the≈øe iniunctions; as wel thereby to make them glory in the impiring ouer him (as I ≈øaid before:) as likewi≈øe to make him≈øelfe ≈øo to be tru≈øted in the≈øe little things, that he may haue the better commoditie thereafter, to deceiue them in the end with a tricke once for all; I meane the euerla≈øting perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ≈øoule and body. Then laying this ground, as I haue ≈øaid, the≈øe coniurations mu≈øt haue fewe or moe in number of the per≈øons coniurers (alwayes pa≈ø≈øing the ≈øingular number) according to the qualitie of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and forme of apparition. Two principall things cannot well in that errand be wanted: holy-water (whereby the deuill mockes the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi>) and ≈øome pre≈øent of a liuing thing vnto him. There are likewi≈øe certaine ≈øea≈øons, dayes and houres, that they ob≈øerue in this purpo≈øe: The≈øe things being all ready and prepared, circles are made triangular, quadrangular, round, double or ≈øingle, according to the forme of apparition that they
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:23110:73"/>craue. But to ≈øpeake of the diuers formes of the circles, of the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble characters and cro≈ø≈øes that are within and without, and out-through the ≈øame, of the diuers formes of apparitions, that that craftie ≈øpirit illudes them with, and of all ≈øuch particulars in that action, I remit it to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many that haue bu≈øied their heads in de≈øcribing of the ≈øame; as being but curious, and altogether vnprofitable. And this farre onely I touch, that when the coniured Spirit appeares, which will not be while after many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances, long prayers, and much muttring and murmuring of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurers; like a <hi>Papist</hi> Prie≈øt, di≈øpatching a hunting <hi>Ma≈ø≈øe:</hi> how ≈øoone I ≈øay, he appeares, if they haue mi≈ø≈øed one iote of all their rites; or if any of their feet once ≈ølyde ouer the circle through terrour of his fearefull apparition, hee payes him≈øelfe at that time in his owne hand, of that due debt which they ought him; and otherwi≈øe would haue delayed longer to haue payed him: I meane, hee carries them with him body and ≈øoule. If this be not now a iu≈øt cau≈øe to make them weary of the≈øe formes of coniuration, I leaue it to you to iudge vpon, con≈øidering the long ≈øomne≈ø≈øe of the labour, the preci≈øe keeping of dayes and houres (as I haue ≈øaid) the terriblene≈ø≈øe of apparition, and the pre≈øent perill that they ≈øtand in, in mi≈ø≈øing the lea≈øt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtance or freite, that they ought to ob≈øerue: And on the other part, the deuill is glad to mooue them to a plaine and ≈øquare dealing with him, as I ≈øaid before.</p>

                     <p>From time that they once plainely begin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with him: The effect of their contract con≈øi≈øts in two things: in formes and effects, as I began to tell already, were it not ye interrupted me: (for although the contract be mutual, I ≈øpeake fir≈øt of that part, wherein the diuel obliges him≈øelfe to them) By formes, I meane in what ≈øhape or fa≈øhion he ≈øhall come vnto them, when they call vpon him; And by effects, I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand, in what ≈øpeciall ≈øorts or ≈øeruices he binds him≈øelfe to bee ≈øubiect vnto them. The qualitie of the≈øe formes and effects, is le≈ø≈øe or greater, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the skill and art of the <hi>Magician:</hi> For as to the formes, to ≈øome of the ba≈øer ≈øort of them he obliges him≈øelfe to appeare at their calling vpon him, by ≈øuch a proper name which he ≈øhewes vnto them, either in likenes of a Dog, a Cat, an Ape, or ≈øuch-like other bea≈øt; or el≈øe to an≈øwere by a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:23110:74"/>voice onely. The effects, are to an≈øwere to ≈øuch demands, as concerne cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of di≈øea≈øes, their owne particular menagerie, or ≈øuch other ba≈øe things as they require of him. But to the mo≈øt curious ≈øort, in the formes hee will oblige him≈øelfe, to enter into a dead bodie, and there out of to giue ≈øuch an≈øweres, of the euent of battels, of matters concerning the e≈øtate of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, and ≈øuch like other great que≈øtions: yea, to ≈øome he will bee a continuall attender, in forme of a Page: Hee will permit him≈øelfe to bee coniured, for the ≈øpace of ≈øo many yeeres, either in a tablet or a ring, or ≈øuch like thing, which they may ea≈øily cary about with them: Hee giues them power to ≈øell ≈øuch wares to others, whereof ≈øome will be dearer, and ≈øome better cheape, according to the lying or true ≈øpeaking of the Spirit that is coniured therein: Not but that in very deed, all deuils mu≈øt be lyars; but ≈øo they abu≈øe the ≈øimplicitie of the≈øe wretches, that become their ≈øcholers, that they make them beleeue, that at the fall of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> ≈øome Spirits fell in the aire, ≈øome in the fire, ≈øome in the water, ≈øome in the land, in which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements they ≈øtill remaine. Whereupon they build, that ≈øuch as fell in the fire, or in the aire, are trewer then they, who fell in the water, or in the land, which are all but meere trattles, and forged by the authour of all deceite. For they fell not by weight, as a ≈øolide ≈øub≈øtance, to ≈øticke in any one part; but the principall part of their fall, con≈øi≈øting in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by the falling from the grace of God, wherein they were created, they continued ≈øtil thereafter, and ≈øhall doe while the latter day, in wandring through the world, as Gods hang-men, to execute ≈øuch turnes as hee employes them in: And when any of them are not occupied in that, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne they mu≈øt to their pri≈øon in hell (as it is plaine in the miracle that CHRIST wrought at <hi>Gennezareth</hi>) therein at the latter day to be all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clo≈øed for euer:
<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> and as they deceiue their Schollers in this, ≈øo doe they, in imprinting in them the opinion, that there are ≈øo many Princes, Dukes, and Kings among≈øt them, euery one commanding fewer or moe Legions, and impiring in diuers artes, and quarters of the earth: For though that I will not deny that there be a forme of order among≈øt the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and con≈øequently, was among≈øt them before their fall; yet, either that they bruike the ≈øame ≈øen≈øine; or that God will permit vs to know by dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diuels, ≈øuch heauenly my≈øteries of his, which he would not reueale to vs, neither by Scripture nor Prophets, I thinke no Chri≈øtian will once thinke it. But by the contrary of all ≈øuch my≈øteries, as he hath clo≈øed vp with his Seale of ≈øecrecie; it becommeth vs to be contented with an humble ignorance, they being things not nece≈ø≈øary for our ≈øaluation. But to returne to the purpo≈øe, as the≈øe formes, wherein Satan obliges him≈øelfe to the greate≈øt of the <hi>Magicians,</hi> are wonderfull curious; ≈øo are the effects corre≈øpondent vnto the ≈øame: For he will oblige him≈øelfe to teach them artes and ≈øciences, which he may ea≈øily doe, being ≈øo learned a knaue as he is, to carry them newes from any part of the world, which the agilitie of a Spirit may ea≈øily performe: to reueale to them the ≈øecrets of any per≈øons,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:23110:74"/>≈øo being they be once ≈øpoken, for the thought none knowes but GOD; except ≈øo farre as ye may ghe≈ø≈øe by their countenance, as one who is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øly learned enough in the <hi>Phy≈øiognomie:</hi> Yea, hee will make his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to creepe in credite with Princes, by fore-telling them many great things; part true, part fal≈øe: For if all were fal≈øe, hee would tyne credite at all handes; but alwayes doubt≈øome, as his Oracles were. And he will al≈øo make them to plea≈øe Princes, by faire banquets and daintie di≈øhes, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in ≈øhort ≈øpace fra the farthe≈øt part of the world: For no man doubts but he is a thiefe, and his agilitie (as I ≈øpake before) makes him to come with ≈øuch ≈øpeed. Such like, he wil guard his Schollers with faire armies of hor≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and footmen in appearance, Ca≈øtles and forts, Which all are but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions in the aire, ea≈øily gathered by a Spirit, drawing ≈øo neere to that ≈øub≈øtance him≈øelfe: As in like maner he will learne them many Iuglarie trickes at Cardes, dice, and ≈øuch like, to deceiue mens ≈øen≈øes thereby, and ≈øuch innumerable fal≈øe practiques, which are proued by ouer-many in this aage; as they who are acquainted with that <hi>Italian</hi> called SCOTO yet liuing, can report: And yet are all the≈øe things but deluding of the ≈øen≈øes, and no wayes true in ≈øub≈øtance; as were the fal≈øe miracles wrought by King <hi>Pharaos</hi> Magicians, for counterfeiting <hi>Moy≈øes:</hi> For that is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt GODS miracles and the diuels, GOD is a creatour, what he makes appeare in myracle, it is ≈øo in effect: As <hi>Moy≈øes</hi> Rod being ca≈øten downe, was no doubt turned into a naturall Serpent: where as the diuel (as Gods Ape) counterfetting that by his <hi>Magicians,</hi> made their wandes to appeare ≈øo, onely to mens outward ≈øen≈øes: as kythed in effect by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deuoured by the other; For it is no wonder, that the diuel may delude our ≈øen≈øes, ≈øince we ≈øee by common proofe, that ≈øimple Iugglars wil make an hundreth things ≈øeeme both to our eyes and eares otherwayes then they are.

<note place="margin">Acts 16.</note> who≈øe Spirit was put to ≈øilence by the Apo≈øtle, could be no other thing but a very Sorcerer or Witch, if ye admit the vulgar di≈øtinction, to be in a maner trew, whereof I ≈øpake in the beginning of our conference: For that ≈øpirit whereby ≈øhe conque≈øted ≈øuch gaine to her Ma≈øters, was not at her rai≈øing or commanding, as ≈øhee plea≈øed to appoint, but ≈øpake by her tongue, as well publikely as priuately: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ≈øhe ≈øeemed to draw nearer to the ≈øort of <hi>Demoniakes</hi> or po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, if that coniunction betwixt them, had not beene of her owne con≈øent; as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by her, not being tormented therewith, and by her conque≈øting of ≈øuch gaine to her Ma≈øters (as I haue alreadie ≈øaid.)

                     <p>This word of <hi>Sorcerie</hi> is a Latine word, which is taken from ca≈øting of the lot, and therefore he that v≈øeth it, is called <hi>Sortiarius √† ≈øorte:</hi> As to the word of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> it is nothing but a proper name giuen in our language: The cau≈øe wherefore they were called <hi>Sortiarij,</hi> proceeded of their practiques, ≈øeeming to come of lot or chance, ≈øuch as the turning of the riddle, the knowing of the forme of prayers, or ≈øuch like tokens, if a per≈øon di≈øea≈øed would liue or die: And in generall, that name was giuen them for v≈øing of ≈øuch charmes, and freits, as that Craft teacheth them. Many points of their craft and practicques are common betwixt the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> and them: for they ≈øerue both one Ma≈øter, although in diuers fa≈øhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And as I deuided the <hi>Necromancers</hi> into two ≈øortes, learned and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned; ≈øo mu≈øt I deny them in other two, rich and of better accompt; poore and of ba≈øer degree. The≈øe two degrees now of per≈øons, that practi≈øe this Craft, an≈øwere to the pa≈ø≈øions in them, which (I tolde you before) the Diuell v≈øed as meanes to entice them to his ≈øeruice: for ≈øuch of them as are in great mi≈øerie and pouertie, he allures to follow him, by promi≈øing vnto them great riches, and worldly commoditie: Such as though rich, yet burne in a de≈øperate de≈øire of reuenge, he allures them by promi≈øes, to get their turne ≈øatisfied to their hearts contentment. It is to be noted now, that that olde and craftie enemie of ours, a≈ø≈øailes none, though touched with any of the≈øe two extremities, except he fir≈øt finde an entre≈ø≈øe ready for him, either by the great ignorance of the per≈øon he deales with, ioyned with an euill life, or el≈øe by their carele≈øne≈ø≈øe and contempt of God: And finding them in an vtter de≈øpaire, for one of the≈øe two former cau≈øes that I haue ≈øpoken of, he prepares the way by feeding them craftely in their humour, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them further and further with de≈øpaire, while hee finde the time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to di≈øcouer him≈øelfe vnto them: At which time, either vpon their wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ≈øolitarie in the fieldes, or el≈øe lying pan≈øing in their bed, but alwaies without the company of any other, hee either by a voyce, or in likene≈ø≈øe

<note place="margin">Apocrypha of Bel and the Dragon.</note> which is much more po≈ø≈øible to him to doe, being a Spirit, then to a mighty wind, being but a naturall Meteore, to tran≈øport from one place to another, a ≈øolide body, as is commonly and daily ≈øeene in practi≈øe: But in this violent forme they cannot be caried, but a ≈øhort bounds, agreeing with the ≈øpace that they may retaine their breath: for if it were longer, their breath could not remaine vnextingui≈øhed, their body being caried in ≈øuch a violent and forcible maner; as by example: If one fall off a ≈ømall height, his life is but in perill, according to the hard or ≈øoft lighting: but if one fall from an high and ≈øtay rocke, his breath will be forcibly bani≈øhed from the body, before he can win to the earth, as is oft ≈øeene by experience: And in this tran≈øporting they ≈øay them≈øelues, that they are inui≈øible to any other, except among≈øt them≈øelues, which may al≈øo be po≈ø≈øible in my opinion: For if the deuill may forme what kinde of impre≈ø≈øions he plea≈øes in the aire, (as I haue ≈øaid before, ≈øpeaking of <hi>Magie</hi>) why may hee not farre ea≈øilier thicken and ob≈øcure ≈øo the aire, that is next about them, by contracting it ≈øtraite together, that the beames of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans eyes cannot pierce thorow the ≈øame, to ≈øee them? But the third way of their comming to their conuentions, is that, wherein I thinke them deluded: for ≈øome of them ≈øay, that being transformed in the likene≈ø≈øe of a little bea≈øt or foule, they will come and pierce through what≈øoeuer hou≈øe or Church, though all ordinarie pa≈ø≈øages be clo≈øed, by what≈øoeuer open the aire may enter in at: And ≈øome ≈øay, that their bodies lying ≈øtill, as in an exta≈øie, their ≈øpirits will be raui≈øhed out of their bodies, and caried to ≈øuch places; and for verifying thereof, will giue euident tokens, as well by witne≈ø≈øes that haue ≈øeene their body lying ≈øencele≈ø≈øe in the meane time, as by naming per≈øons whom-with they met, and giuing tokens what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe was among≈øt them, whom otherwi≈øe they could not haue knowen: for this forme of iourneying, they affirme to v≈øe mo≈øt, when they are tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from one countrey to another.</p>

                     <p>Surely I long to heare your owne opinion of this: for they are like old wiues trattles about the fire. The rea≈øons that mooue me to thinke that the≈øe are meere illu≈øions, are the≈øe: Fir≈øt, for them that are transformed in likene≈ø≈øe of bea≈øts or foules, can enter through ≈øo narrow pa≈ø≈øages, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I may ea≈øily beleeue that the diuell could by his workman≈øhip vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the aire, make them appeare to be in ≈øuch formes, either to them≈øelues, or to others: yet how he can contract a ≈øolide body within ≈øo little roome, I thinke it is directly contrary to it ≈øelfe; for to be made ≈øo little, and yet not dimini≈øhed; to be ≈øo ≈øtraitly drawen together, and yet feele no paine, I thinke it is ≈øo contrary to the qualitie of a naturall bodie, and ≈øo like to the little tran≈øub≈øtantiate god in the Papi≈øts Ma≈ø≈øe, that I can neuer beleeue it: So to haue a quantitie, is ≈øo proper to a ≈øolide body, that as all Philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers conclude, it cannot be any more without one, then a ≈øpirit can haue one:
<note place="margin">Actes 12.</note> For when <hi>Peter</hi> came out of the pri≈øon, and the doores all locked; it was not by any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tracting of his body in ≈øo little roome, but by the giuing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:23110:79"/>place of the doore, though vne≈øpied by the Gaylors: And yet is there no compari≈øon, when this is done, betwixt the power of God, and of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel. As to their forme of exta≈øie and ≈øpirituall tran≈øporting, it is certaine the ≈øoules going out of the body, is the onely definition of naturall death: and who are once dead, God forbid we ≈øhould thinke that it ≈øhould lie in the power of all the diuels in hell, to re≈øtore them to their life againe; although he can put his owne ≈øpirit in a dead body, which the <hi>Necromancers</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly practi≈øe, as ye haue heard. For that is the office properly belonging to God; and be≈øides that, the ≈øoule once parting from the body, cannot wander any longer in the world, but to the owne re≈øting place mu≈øt it goe immediately, abiding the coniunction of the body againe, at the latter day. And what Chri≈øt or the Prophets did miraculou≈øly in this ca≈øe, it can in no Chri≈øtian mans opinion, be made common with the diuel. As for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tokens that they giue for prouing of this, it is very po≈ø≈øible to the diuels craft, to per≈øwade them to the≈øe meanes: for he being a ≈øpirit, may he not ≈øo raui≈øh their thoughts, and dull their ≈øen≈øes, that their body lying as dead, he may obiect to their ≈øpirits, as it were in a dreame, and (as the Poets write of <hi>Morpheus</hi>) repre≈øent ≈øuch formes of per≈øons, of places, and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, as he plea≈øes to illude them with? Yea, that he may deceiue them with the greater efficacie, may he not at that ≈øame in≈øtant by fellow angels of his, illude ≈øuch other per≈øons ≈øo in that ≈øame fa≈øhion, whom-with hee makes them to beleeue that they mette, that all their reports and tokens, though ≈øeuerally examined, may euery one agree with another? And that what≈øoeuer actions, either in hurting men or bea≈øts, or what≈øoeuer other thing that they fal≈øly imagine, at that time to haue done, may by him≈øelfe or his marrowes, at that ≈øame time be done indeed; ≈øo as if they would giue for a token of their being raui≈øhed at the death of ≈øuch a per≈øon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ≈øo ≈øhort ≈øpace thereafter, whom they beleeue to haue poi≈øoned, or witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that in≈øtant, might he not at that ≈øame houre, haue ≈ømitten that ≈øame per≈øon, by the permi≈ø≈øion of GOD, to the farther deceiuing of them, and to mooue others to beleeue them? And this is ≈øurely the likelye≈øt way, and mo≈øt according to rea≈øon, which my iudgement can finde out in this, and what≈øoeuer other vnnaturall points of their confe≈ø≈øion: And by the≈øe meanes ≈øhall we ≈øaile ≈øurely, betwixt <hi>Charybdis</hi> and <hi>Scylla,</hi> in e≈øchewing the not beleeuing of them altogether on the one part, le≈øt that draw vs to the errour, that there is no <hi>Witches:</hi> and on the other part in beleeuing of it, make vs to e≈øchew the falling into innumerable ab≈øurdities, both mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrou≈øly again≈øt all Theologie diuine, and Philo≈øophie humane.</p>

The fir≈øt is, where ≈øpirits trouble ≈øome hou≈øes or ≈øolitarie places: The ≈øecond, where Spirits follow vpon certaine per≈øons, and at diuers houres trouble them: The third, when they enter within them, and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe them: The fourth is the≈øe kinde of Spirits that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vulgarly the <hi>Fairie:</hi> Of the three former kinds, ye heard already, how they may artificially be made by <hi>Witchcraft</hi> to trouble folke; now it re≈øtes to ≈øpeake of their naturall comming as it were, and not rai≈øed by <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft.</hi> But generally I mu≈øt forewarne you of one thing before I enter in this purpo≈øe: that is, that although in my di≈øcour≈øing of them, I deuide them in diuers kinds, ye mu≈øt notwith≈øtanding thereof note my phra≈øe of ≈øpeaking in that: For doubtle≈ølie they are in effect, but all one kinde of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who for abu≈øing the more of mankinde, take on the≈øe ≈øundrie ≈øhapes, and v≈øe diuers formes of outward actions, as if ≈øome were of nature better then other. Now I returne to my purpo≈øe: As to the fir≈øt kinde of the≈øe ≈øpirits, that were called by the ancients by diuers names, according as their actions were: For if they were Spirits that haunted ≈øome hou≈øes, by appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in diuers and horrible formes, and making great dinne, they were
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:23110:84"/>called <hi>Lemures</hi> or <hi>Spectra:</hi> If they appeared in likene≈ø≈øe of any defunct to ≈øome friends of his, they were called <hi>vmbraemortuorum:</hi> And ≈øo innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ≈øtiles they got, according to their actions, as I haue ≈øaid alreadie; as we ≈øee by experience, how many ≈øtiles they haue giuen them in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in the like maner. Of the appearing of the≈øe Spirits, we are certified by the Scriptures,
<note place="margin">E≈øay 13. Iere. 50.</note> where the Prophet <hi>E≈øay</hi> 13. and 34.

The cau≈øe why they haunt ≈øollitarie places, it is by rea≈øon, that they may affray and brangle the more the faith of ≈øuch as them alone hauntes ≈øuch places: For our nature is ≈øuch, as in companies we are not ≈øo ≈øoone moued to any ≈øuch kind of feare, as being ≈øollitarie, which the diuel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well enough, he will not therefore a≈ø≈øaile vs but when wee are weake: And be≈øides that, God will not permit him ≈øo to di≈øhonour the ≈øocieties and companies of Chri≈øtians, as in publicque times and places to walke vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiblie among≈øt them: On the other part, when he troubles certaine hou≈øes that are dwelt in, it is a ≈øure token either of gro≈ø≈øe ignorance, or of ≈øome gro≈ø≈øe and ≈ølanderous ≈øinnes among≈øt the inhabitants thereof, which God by that extraordinarie rod puni≈øhes.</p>

By two meanes this great kinde of abu≈øe might po≈ø≈øibly be performed: The one, when the diuel onely as a Spirit, and ≈øtealing out the ≈øperme of a dead bodie, abu≈øes them that way, they not graithly ≈øeeing any ≈øhape, or feeling any thing, but that which hee ≈øo conueyes in that part, as we reade of a Mona≈øterie of Nunnes which were burnt for their being that way abu≈øed: The other meane is, when he borrowes a dead body and ≈øo vi≈øibly, and as it ≈øeemes vnto them naturally as a man conuer≈øes with them. But it is to be noted, that in what≈øoeuer way he v≈øeth it, that ≈øperme ≈øeemes intollerably cold to the per≈øon abu≈øed: For if he ≈øteale out the nature of a quicke per≈øon, it cannot be ≈øo quickly caried, but it will both tine the ≈øtrength and heate by the way, which it could neuer haue had for lacke of agitation, which in the time of procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the procurer and wakener vp of the≈øe two naturall qualities: And if he occupying the dead bodie as his lodging, expell the ≈øame out thereof in the due time, it mu≈øt likewi≈øe be cold by the participation with the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the dead body whereout of it comes. And whereas ye enquire if the≈øe Spirits be diuided in ≈øexes or not, I thinke the rules of Philo≈øophie may ea≈øily re≈øolue a man of the contrary: For it is a ≈øure principle of that Art, that nothing can be diuided in ≈øexes, except ≈øuch liuing bodies as mu≈øt haue a naturall ≈øeed to genere by: But we know Spirits haue no ≈øeed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to them≈øelues, nor yet can they gender one with an other.</p>

                     <p>As to your fir≈øt que≈øtion; there are diuers ≈øymptomes, whereby that heauie trouble may be di≈øcerned from a naturall ≈øickene≈ø≈øe, and ≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally three, omitting the diuers vaine ≈øignes that the Papi≈øts attribute vnto it: Such as the raging at holy water, their fleeing abacke from the Cro≈ø≈øe, their not abiding the hearing of God named, and innumerable ≈øuch like vaine things that were alike fa≈øhious and feckles to recite: But to come to the≈øe three ≈øymptomes then, whereof I ≈øpake, I account the one of them to be the incredible ≈øtrength of the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed creature, which will farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede the ≈øtrength of ≈øixe of the wighte≈øt and wode≈øt of any other men that are not ≈øo troubled: The next is the boldening vp ≈øo farre of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents brea≈øt and belly, with ≈øuch an vnnaturall ≈øturring and vehement agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation within them, and ≈øuch an ironie hardne≈ø≈øe of his ≈øinewes ≈øo ≈øtiffely bended out, that it were not po≈ø≈øible to pricke out as it were the skinne of any other per≈øon ≈øo farre; ≈øo mightily workes the diuell in all the members and ≈øen≈øes of his body, hee being locally within the ≈øame, ≈øuppo≈øe of his ≈øoule and affections thereof, hee haue no more power then of any other mans: The la≈øt is, the ≈øpeaking of ≈øundry languages, which the patient is knowen, by them that were acquainted with him, neuer to haue learned, and that with an vncouth and hollow voice, and all the time of his ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, a greater motion being in his brea≈øt then in his mouth: But fra this la≈øt ≈øymptome is excepted ≈øuch, as are altogether in the time of their po≈ø≈øe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing bereft of all their ≈øen≈øes, being po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed with a dumbe and blind ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whereof Chri≈øt relieued one, in the 12. of <hi>Matthew.</hi> And as to your next demand, it is fir≈øt to be doubted if the Papi≈øts, or any not profe≈ø≈øing the onely true Religion, can relieue any of that trouble: and next, in ca≈øe they can, vpon what re≈øpect it is po≈ø≈øible vnto them. As to the former, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two rea≈øons it is grounded: fir≈øt that it is knowen ≈øo many of them to be counterfeit, which wyle the Clergie inuents for confirming of their
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:23110:87"/>rotten Religion: The next is, that by experience we finde, that few who are po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed indeed, are fully cured by them; but rather the diuell is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to relea≈øe the bodily hurting of them, for a ≈øhort ≈øpace, thereby to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the perpetuall hurt of the ≈øoules of ≈øo many that by the≈øe fal≈øe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles may be induced or confirmed in the profe≈ø≈øion of that erroneous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; euen as I told you before that he doeth in the fal≈øe cures or ca≈øting off of di≈øea≈øes by Witches. As to the other part of the argument in ca≈øe they can, which rather (with reuerence of the learned thinking otherwi≈øe) I am induced to beleeue, by rea≈øon of the faithfull report that men ≈øound of Religion, haue made according to their ≈øight thereof, I thinke if ≈øo be I ≈øay the≈øe may be the re≈øpects, whereupon the Papi≈øts may haue that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Chri≈øt gaue a commi≈ø≈øion and power to his Apo≈øtles to ca≈øt out diuels, which they according thereunto put in execution: the rules he bade them ob≈øerue in that action, was fa≈øting and prayer; and the action it ≈øelfe to be done in his name. This power of theirs proceeded not then of any vertue in them, but onely in him who directed them; as was clearely prooued by <hi>Iudas</hi> his hauing as great power in that commi≈ø≈øion, as any of the re≈øt. It is ea≈øie then to be vnder≈øtood that the ca≈øting out of diuels, is by the vertue of fa≈øting and prayer, and in calling of the Name of God, ≈øuppo≈øe many imperfections be in the per≈øon that is the in≈øtrument, as Chri≈øt him≈øelfe teacheth vs of the power that fal≈øe prophets ≈øhall haue to ca≈øt out diuels. It is no wonder then, the≈øe re≈øpects of this action being con≈øidered, that it may be po≈ø≈øible to the Papi≈øts, though erring in ≈øundry points of Religion to accompli≈øh this, if they v≈øe the right forme pre≈øcribed by Chri≈øt herein: For what the wor≈øe is that action that they erre in other things; more then their Bapti≈øme is the wor≈øe that they erre in the other Sacrament, and haue eiked many vaine freittes to the Bapti≈øme it ≈øelfe.</p>

                        <hi>Samuel</hi> was dead as well before that; and ≈øo none could ≈ølaunder him with medling in that vnlawful arte. For the cau≈øe why, as I take it, that God will not permit Satan to v≈øe the ≈øhapes of ≈øimilitudes of any innocent per≈øons at ≈øuch vnlawfull times, is, that God will not permit that any inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent per≈øons ≈øhalbe ≈ølandered with that vile defection: for then the diuell would finde waies anew, to calumniate the be≈øt. And this wee haue in proofe by them that are carried with the <hi>Phairie,</hi> who neuer ≈øee the ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of any in that Court, but of them that thereafter are tryed to haue beene brethren and ≈øi≈øters of that craft: And this was likewi≈øe prooued by the confe≈ø≈øion of a young La≈ø≈øe, troubled with ≈øpirits, laid on her by Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft: that although ≈øhe ≈øaw the ≈øhapes of diuers men and women trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling her, and naming the per≈øons whom the≈øe ≈øhadowes repre≈øent: yet neuer one of them are found to be innocent, but all clearely tryed to bee mo≈øt guiltie, and the mo≈øt part of them confe≈ø≈øing the ≈øame. And be≈øides that, I thinke it hath beene ≈øeldome heard tell of, that any, whom per≈øons guiltie of that crime accu≈øed, as hauing knowen them to be their marrowes by eye-≈øight, and not by heare-≈øay, but ≈øuch as were ≈øo accu≈øed of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, could not be clearely tried vpon them, were at the lea≈øt publikely knowen to be of a very euill life and reputation: ≈øo iealous is God I ≈øay, of the fame of them that are innocent in ≈øuch cau≈øes. And be≈øides that, there are two other good helps that may be v≈øed for their triall: The one is, the finding of their marke, and the trying the in≈øen≈øiblenes therof: The other
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:23110:90"/>is their fleeting on the water: for as in a ≈øecret murther, if the dead carka≈ø≈øe bee at any time thereafter handled by the murtherer, it will gu≈øh out of bloud, as if the bloud were crying to the heauen for reuenge of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, God hauing appointed that ≈øecret ≈øupernaturall ≈øigne, for triall of that ≈øecret vnnaturall crime, ≈øo it appeares that God hath appointed (for a ≈øupernaturall ≈øigne of the mon≈øtrous impietie of Witches) that the water ≈øhall refu≈øe to receiue them in her bo≈øome, that haue ≈øhaken off them the ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred water of Bapti≈øme, and wilfully refu≈øed the benefite thereof: No, not ≈øo much as their eyes are able to ≈øhed teares (threaten and torture them as ye plea≈øe) while fir≈øt they repent (God not permitting them to di≈ø≈øemble their ob≈øtinacie in ≈øo horrible a crime) albeit the women-kind e≈øpecially, be able otherwayes to ≈øhed teares at euery light occa≈øion when they will, yea, although it were di≈ø≈øemblingly like the Crocodiles.</p>

               <p>But as this is generally trew in the actions of all men, ≈øo is it more ≈øpecially trew in the affaires of Kings: for Kings being publike per≈øons, by rea≈øon of their office and authority, are as it were ≈øet (as it was ≈øaid of old) vpon a publike ≈øtage, in the ≈øight of all the people; where all the beholders eyes are attentiuely bent to looke and pry in the least circum≈øtance of their ≈øecretest drifts: Which ≈øhould make Kings the more carefull not to harbour the ≈øecrete≈øt thought in their minde, but ≈øuch as in the owne time they ≈øhall not be a≈øhamed openly to auouch; a≈ø≈øuring them≈øelues that Time the mother of Veritie, will in the due ≈øea≈øon bring her owne daughter to perfection.</p>
               <p>The trew practi≈øe hereof, I haue as a King oft found in my owne per≈øon, though I thanke God, neuer to my ≈øhame, hauing laide my count, euer to walke as in the eyes of the Almightie, examining euer ≈øo the ≈øecretest of my drifts, before I gaue them cour≈øe, as how they might ≈øome day bide the touchstone of a publike triall.

But ≈øince contrary to my intention and expectation, as I haue alreadie ≈øaid, this Booke is now vented, and ≈øet foorth to the publike view of the world, and con≈øequently ≈øubiect to euery mans cen≈øure, as the current of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection leades him, I am now forced, as well for re≈øisting to the malice of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of enuie, who like wa≈øpes ≈øucke venome out of euery whol≈øome herbe; as for the ≈øatisfaction of the godly hone≈øt ≈øort, in any thing that they may mistake therein, both to publi≈øh and ≈øpread the true copies thereof, for defacing of the fal≈øe copies that are alreadie ≈øpread, as I am enformed; as likewi≈øe by this Preface, to cleare ≈øuch parts thereof, as in re≈øpect of the conci≈øed ≈øhortne≈øse of my Style, may be mi≈ø-interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein.</p>
               <p>To come then particularly to the matter of my Booke, there are two ≈øpeciall great points, which (as I am informed) the malicious ≈øort of men haue detracted therein; and ≈øome of the honest ≈øort haue ≈øeemed a little to mistake: whereof the first and greatest is, that ≈øome ≈øentences therein ≈øhould ≈øeeme to furni≈øh grounds to men, to doubt of my ≈øinceritie in that Religion, which I haue euer constantly profe≈ø≈øed: the other is, that in ≈øome parts thereof I ≈øhould ≈øeeme to nouri≈øh in my minde, a vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue re≈øolution again≈øt <hi>England,</hi> or at the lea≈øt, ≈øome principals there, for the Queene my mothers quarrell.</p>
               <p>The first calumnie (mo≈øt grieuous indeed) is grounded vpon the ≈øharpe and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wordes, that therein are v≈øed in the de≈øcription of the humors of Puritanes, and ra≈øh-headie Preachers, that thinke it their honour to contend with Kings, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe whole kingdomes. The other point is onely grounded vpon the ≈øtrait charge. I giue my Sonne, not to heare nor ≈øuffer any vnreuerent ≈øpeeches or bookes against any of his parents or progenitors: wherein I doe alledge my owne experience anent the Queene my mother; affirming, that I neuer found any that were of perfit aage the time of her reigne here, ≈øo ≈øtedfa≈øtly trew to me in all my troubles, as the≈øe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantly kept their allegiance to her in her time. But if the charitable Reader will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui≈øedly con≈øider, both the methode and matter of my Treati≈øe, he will ea≈øily iudge, what wrong I haue ≈øu≈øtained by the carping at both: For my Booke, ≈øuppo≈øe very ≈ømall, being diuided in three ≈øeuerall parts; the first part thereof onely treats of a Kings duety towards God in Religion, wherein I haue ≈øo clearely made profe≈øsion of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, calling it the Religion wherein I was brought vp, and euer made profe≈øsion of, and wi≈øhing him euer to continue in the ≈øame, as the onely trew forme of Gods wor≈øhip; that I would haue thought my ≈øincere plainne≈ø≈øe in that fir≈øt part vpon that ≈øubiect, ≈øhould haue ditted the mouth of the mo≈øt enuious <hi>Momus,</hi> that euer
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:23110:93"/>hell did hatch, from barking at any other part of my booke vpon that ground, except they would alledge me to be contrarie to my ≈øelfe, which in ≈øo ≈ømall a volume would ≈ømell of too great weakene≈ø≈øe, and ≈øliprine≈ø≈øe of memory. And the ≈øecond part of my booke, teaches my Sonne how to v≈øe his Office, in the admini≈øtration of Iu≈øtice and Politicke Gouernment: The third onely containing a Kings outward behauiour in indifferent things; what agreeance and conformitie hee ought to keepe betwixt his outward behauiour in the≈øe things, and the vertuous qualities of his minde; and how they ≈øhould ≈øerue for trun≈øh-men, to interprete the inward dispo≈øition of the minde, to the eyes of them that cannot ≈øee farther within him, and therefore mu≈øt onely iudge of him by the outward appearance: So as if there were no more to be looked into, but the very methode and order of the booke, it will ≈øufficiently cleare me of that fir≈øt and grieuou≈øe≈øt imputation, in the point of Religion: ≈øince in the fir≈øt part, where Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is onely treated of, I ≈øpeake ≈øo plainely. And what in other parts I ≈øpeake of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes, it is onely of their morall faults, in that part where I ≈øpeake of Policie: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring when they contemne the Law and ≈øouereigne authoritie, what exemplare pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment they de≈øerue for the ≈øame. And now as to the matter it ≈øelfe whereupon this ≈øcandall is taken, that I may ≈øufficiently ≈øatisfie all honest men, and by a iu≈øt Apologie rai≈øe vp a bra≈øen wall or bulwarke again≈øt all the darts of the enuious, I will the more narrowly rip vp the words, whereat they ≈øeeme to be ≈øomewhat ≈øtomacked.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt then, as to the name of Puritanes, I am not ignorant that the style thereof doeth properly belong onely to that vile ≈øect amongst the Anabapti≈øts, called the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of loue; becau≈øe they thinke them≈øelues onely pure, and in a maner without ≈øinne, the onely trwe Church, and onely worthy to be participant of the Sacraments, and all the re≈øt of the world to be but abomination in the ≈øight of God. Of this ≈øpeciall ≈øect I principally meane, when I ≈øpeake of Puritans; diuers of them, as <hi>Browne, Penry</hi> and others, hauing at ≈øundrie times come into Scotland, to ≈øow their popple amongst vs (and from my heart I wi≈øh, that they had left no ≈øchollers behinde them, who by their fruits will in the owne time be manifested) and partly indeede, I giue this ≈øtyle to ≈øuch brain-≈øicke and headie Preachers their di≈øciples and followers, as refu≈øing to be called of that ≈øect, yet participate too much with their humours, in maintaining the aboue mentioned errours; not onely agreeing with the generall rule of all Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bapti≈øts, in the contempt of the ciuill Magi≈øtrate, and in leaning to their owne dreams and reuelations; but particularly with this ≈øect, in accounting all men profane that ≈øweare not to all their fanta≈øies, in making for euery particular que≈øtion of the policie of the Church, as great commotion, as if the article of the Trinitie were called in controuer≈øie, in making the ≈øcriptures to be ruled by their con≈øcience, and not their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience by the Scripture; and he that denies the lea≈øt iote of their grounds, <hi>≈øit tibi tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ethnicus &amp; publicanus;</hi> not worthy to enioy the benefite of breathing, much le≈ø≈øe to participate with them of the Sacraments: and before that any of their grounds be impugned, let King, people, Law and all be trode vnder foote: Such holy warres are to be preferred to an vngodly peace: no, in ≈øuch ca≈øes Chri≈øtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not onely to be re≈øi≈øted vnto, but not to be prayed for, for prayer must come of Faith; and it is reuealed to their con≈øciences, that GOD will heare no prayer for ≈øuch a Prince. Iudge then, Chri≈øtian Reader, if I wrong this ≈øort of people, in giuing them the ≈øtile of that ≈øect, who≈øe errours they imitate: and ≈øince they are contented
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:23110:94"/>to weare their liuerie let them not be a≈øhamed to borrow al≈øo their name. It is onely of this kinde of men, that in this booke I write ≈øo ≈øharply; and whom I wi≈øh my Sonne to puni≈øh, in-ca≈øe they refu≈øe to obey the Law, and will not cea≈øe to ≈øturre vp a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: Whom against I haue written the more bitterly, in respect of diuers famous libels, and iniurious ≈øpeaches ≈øpred by ≈øome of them, not onely di≈øhonourably inuectiue against all Christian Princes, but euen reprochfull to our profe≈øsion and Religion, in respect they are come out vnder coulour thereof: and yet were neuer an≈øwered but by Papists, who generally medle a≈øwell against them, as the religion it ≈øelfe; whereby the skandale was rather doubled, then taken away. But on the other part, I protest vpon mine honour, I meane it not generally of all Preachers, or others, that like bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ≈øingle forme of policie in our Church, then of the many Ceremonies in the Church of England: that are per≈øwaded, that their Bi≈øhops ≈ømell of a Papall ≈øupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, that the Surpli≈øe, the cornerd cap, and ≈øuch like, are the outward badges of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øh errours. No, I am ≈øo farre from being contentious in the≈øe things (which for my owne part I euer esteemed as indifferent) as I doe equally loue and honour the learned and graue men of either of the≈øe opinions. It can no wayes become me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ≈øo lightly a ≈øentence, in ≈øo old a controuer≈øie. Wee all (God be prai≈øed) doe agree in the grounds; and the bitterne≈øse of men vpon ≈øuch questions, doeth but trouble the peace of the Church; and giues aduantage and entry to the Papists by our diui≈øion: But towards them, I onely v≈øe this proui≈øion, that where the Law is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, they may content them≈øelues ≈øoberly and quietly with their owne opinions, not re≈øisting to the authoritie, nor breaking the Law of the Countrey; neither aboue all, ≈øturring any rebellion or ≈øchi≈øme: but po≈ø≈øe≈øsing their ≈øoules in peace, let them prea≈ø≈øe by patience, and well grounded rea≈øons, either to per≈øwade all the rest to like of their iudgements; or where they ≈øee better grounds on the other part, not to bee a≈øhamed peaceably to incline thereunto, laying a≈øide all praeoccupied opinions.</p>
               <p>And that this is the onely meaning of my Booke, and not any coldne≈ø≈øe or cracke in Religion, that place doeth plainely witne≈ø≈øe, where, after I haue ≈øpoken of the faults in our Eccle≈øiasticall e≈øtate I exhort my ≈øonne to be beneficiall vnto the good-men of the Mini≈øtrie; prai≈øing God there, that there is pre≈øently a ≈øufficient number of good men of them in this kingdome: and yet are they all knowne to be again≈øt the forme of the Engli≈øh Church. Yea, ≈øo farre I am in that place from admitting corruption in Religion, as I wi≈øh him in promoouing them, to v≈øe ≈øuch caution, as may pre≈øerue their e≈øtate from creeping to corruption; euer v≈øing that forme through the whole Booke, where euer I ≈øpeake of bad Preachers, terming them ≈øome of the Mini≈øters, and not Mini≈øters or Mini≈øtrie in generall. And to conclude this point of Religion, what indifferencie of Religion can <hi>Momus</hi> call that in mee, where, ≈øpeaking of my ≈øonnes marriage (in ca≈øe it plea≈øed God before that time to cut the threed of my life) I plainly forewarne him of the inconuenients that were like to en≈øew, inca≈øe he ≈øhould marry any that be of a different profe≈øsion in Religion from him: notwithstanding that the number of Princes profe≈øsing our Religion be ≈øo ≈ømall, as it is hard to fore≈øee, how he can be that way, meetly matched according to his ranke.</p>
               <p>And as for the other point, that by ≈øome parts in this booke, it ≈øhould appeare, that I doe nouri≈øh in my minde, a vindictiue re≈øolution again≈øt England, or ≈øome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals there; it is ≈øurely more then wonderfull vnto me, vpon what grounds they can
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:23110:94"/>haue gathered ≈øuch conclu≈øions. For as vpon the one part, Ineither by name nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription poynt out England in that part of my di≈øcour≈øe; ≈øo vpon the other, I plainly bewray my meaning to be of Scotti≈øh-men, where I conclude that purpo≈øe in the≈øe termes: <q>That the loue I beare to my Sonne, hath mooued me to be ≈øo plaine in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: for ≈øo that I di≈øcharge my con≈øcience to him in vttering the verity, I care not what any traitour or trea≈øon-allower doe thinke of it.</q> And Engli≈øh-men could not thereby be meant, ≈øince they could be no traitours, where they ought no alleageance. I am not ignorant of a wi≈øe and princely apophthegme, which the ≈øame Queene of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland vttered about the time of her owne Coronation. But the drift of that di≈øcour≈øe doth fully cleare my intention, being onely grounded vpon that precept to my Sonne, that he ≈øhould not permit any vnreuerent detracting of his praedece≈ø≈øours; bringing in that purpo≈øe of my mother onely for an example of my experience anent Scotti≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, without v≈øing any per≈øwa≈øion to him of reuenge. For a Kings giuing of any fault the dew ≈øtile, inferres no reduction of the faulters pardon. No, I am by a degree nearer of kinne vnto my mother then he is, neither thinke I my ≈øelfe, either that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie, or that neere my end, that I neede to make ≈øuch a <hi>Dauidicall</hi> te≈øtament; ≈øince I haue euer thought it the dewtie of a worthie Prince, rather with a pike, then a penne, to write his iu≈øt reuenge: But in this matter I haue no delite to be large, wi≈øhing all men to iudge of my future proiects, according to my by-pa≈øt actions.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing as much in≈øi≈øted in the clearing of the≈øe two points, as will (I hope) giue ≈øufficient ≈øatisfaction to all hone≈øt men, and leauing the enuious to the foode of their owne venome; I will heartily pray thee, louing Reader, charitably to conceiue of my hone≈øt intention in this Booke. I know the greatest part of the people of this whole I≈øle, haue beene very curious for a ≈øight thereof: ≈øome for the loue they beare me, either being particularly acquainted with me, or by a good report that perhappes they haue heard of me; and therefore longed to ≈øee any thing, that proceeded from that authour whom they ≈øo loued and honoured; ≈øince bookes are viue Idees of the authours minde. Some onely for meere curio≈øitie, that thinke it their honour to know all new things, were curious to glut their eyes therewith, onely that they might vaunt them to haue ≈øeene it: and ≈øome fraughted with cau≈øle≈ø≈øe enuie at the Authour, did gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ≈øearch out the booke, thinking their ≈øtomacke jit ynough, for turning neuer ≈øo whole≈øome foode into noy≈øome and infectiue bumours: So as this their great concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in curiofitie (though proceeding from farre different complexions) hath enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the vn-timous divulgating of this Booke, farre contrarie to my intention, as I haue alreadie ≈øaid. To which <hi>Hydra</hi> of diuer≈øly-enclined ≈øpectatours, I haue no targe to oppone but plainene≈ø≈øe, patience, and ≈øinceritie: plainene≈ø≈øe, for re≈øoluing and ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the first ≈øort; patience, for to beare with the ≈øhallowne≈ø≈øe of the next; and ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie, to defie the malice of the third with-all. Though I cannot plea≈øe all men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I am contented, ≈øo that Ionely plea≈øe the vertuous ≈øort: and though they al≈øo finde not euery thing therein, ≈øo fully to an≈øwere their expectation, as the argument would ≈øeeme to require; although I would wi≈øh them mode≈øtly to remember, that God hes not be≈øtowed all his gifts vpon one, but parted them by a iu≈øtice distributiue; and that many eyes ≈øee more then one; and that the varietie of mens mindes is ≈øuch, that <hi>tot capita tot≈øen≈øus;</hi> yea, and that euen the very faces, that God hath by nature brought foorth in the world, doe euery one in ≈øome of their particular lineaments, differ from
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:23110:95"/>any other: yet in trewth it was not my intention in handling of this purpo≈øe (as it is ea≈øie to perceiue) fully to ≈øet downe heere all ≈øuch grounds, as might out of the be≈øt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue beene alledged, and out of my owne inuention and experience added, for the perfite in≈øtitution of a King: but onely to giue ≈øome ≈øuch precepts to my owne Sonne, for the gouernement of this kingdome, as was meetest for him to be instructed in, and be≈øt became me to be the informer of.</p>
               <p>If I in this Booke haue beene too particularly plaine, impute it to the nece≈øsitie of the ≈øubiect, not ≈øo much being ordained for the in≈øtitution of a Prince in generall, as I haue ≈øaid, as containing particular precepts to my Sonne in ≈øpeciall: whereof he could haue made but a generall v≈øe, if they had not contained the particular di≈øea≈øes of this kingdome, with the be≈øt remedies for the ≈øame, which it became me best as a King, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing learned both the theoricke and practicke thereof, more plainely to expre≈ø≈øe, then any ≈øimple ≈øchoole man, that onely knowes matters of kingdomes by contemplation.</p>
               <p>But if in ≈øome places it ≈øeeme too ob≈øcure, impute it to the ≈øhortne≈ø≈øe thereof, being both for the re≈øpect of my ≈øelfe, and of my Sonne, con≈øtrained there-unto: my owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect, for fault of lea≈øure, being ≈øo continually occupied in the affaires of my office, as my great burthen, and re≈øtle≈ø≈øe fa≈øhery is more then knowen, to all that knowes or beares of me: for my Sonnes re≈øpect, becau≈øe I know by my ≈øelf, that a Prince ≈øo long as he is young, wil be ≈øo caried away with ≈øome ≈øort of delight or other, that he cannot pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently abide the reading of any large volume: and when he comes to a ful maturity of aage, he mu≈øt be ≈øo bu≈øied in the actiue part of his charge, as he will not be permitted to be≈øtow many houres vpon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>templatiue part therof: So as it was neither fit for him, nor po≈øsible for me, to haue made this Treati≈øe any more ample then it is. Indeed I am li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beholden to the curio≈øitie of ≈øome, who thinking it too large alreadie (as appears) for lacke of lei≈øure to copy it, drew ≈øome notes out of it, for ≈øpeeds ≈øake; putting in the one halfe of the purpo≈øe, and leauing out the other: not vnlike the man that alledged that part of the P≈øalme, <hi>non e≈øt Deus,</hi> but left out the praeceeding words, <hi>Dixit in≈øipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens in corde ≈øuo.</hi> And of the≈øe notes, making a little pamphlet (lacking both my methode and halfe of my matter) entituled it, for≈øooth, <hi>the Kings Te≈øtament,</hi> as if I had eiked a third Te≈øtament of my owne to the two that are in the holy Scriptures. It is trew that in a place thereof, for affirmation of the purpo≈øe I am ≈øpeaking of to my Sonne, I bring my ≈øelfe in there, as ≈øpeaking vpon my Te≈øtament: for in that ≈øen≈øe, euery record in write of a mans opinion in anything (in respect that papers out-liue their authours) is as it were a Te≈øtament of that mans will in that ca≈øe: and in that ≈øen≈øe it is, that in that place I call this Treati≈øe a Testament. But from any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ≈øentence in a booke, to giue the booke it ≈øelfe a title, is as ridiculous, as to ≈øtyle the booke of the P≈øalmes, the booke of <hi>Dixit in≈øipiens,</hi> becau≈øe with the≈øe wordes one of them doeth begin.</p>
               <p>Well, leauing the≈øe new baptizers and blockers of other mens books, to their owne follies, Ireturne to my purpo≈øe, anent the ≈øhortne≈ø≈øe of this booke, ≈øu≈øpecting that all my excu≈øes for the ≈øhortne≈øse thereof, ≈øhall not ≈øatisfie ≈øome, e≈øpecially in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour countrey: who thought, that as I haue ≈øo narrowly in this Treati≈øe touched all the principall ≈øickne≈øses in our kingdome, with ouertures for the remedies thereof, as I ≈øaid before: ≈øo looked they to haue found ≈øomething therein, that ≈øhould haue touched the ≈øickne≈øses of their ≈øtate, in the like ≈øort. But they will ea≈øily excu≈øe me thereof, if they
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:23110:95"/>will con≈øider the forme I haue v≈øed in this Treati≈øe; wherein I onely teach my Son, out of my owne experience, what forme of gouernment is fittest for this kingdome: and in one part thereof ≈øpeaking of the borders, I plainely there doe excu≈øe my ≈øelfe, that I will ≈øpeake nothing of the ≈øtate of <hi>England,</hi> as a matter wherein I neuer had experience. I know indeed, no kingdome lackes her owne di≈øea≈øes, and likewi≈øe what interest I haue in the pro≈øperitie of that ≈øtate: for although I would be ≈øilent, my blood and di≈øcent doeth ≈øufficiently proclaime it. But notwith≈øtanding, ≈øince there is a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Queene there pre≈øently reigning, who hath ≈øo long with ≈øo great wi≈øedome and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie gouerned her kingdomes, as (I mu≈øt in trew ≈øinceritie confe≈ø≈øe) the like hath not beene read nor heard of, either in our time, or ≈øince the dayes of the Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Augu≈øtus;</hi> it could no wayes become me, farre inferiour to her in knowledge and experience, to be a bu≈øie-body in other princes matters, and to fi≈øh in other folkes waters, as the prouerbe is: No, I hope by the contrary (with Gods grace) euer to keepe that Christian rule, To doe as I would be done to: and I doubt nothing, yea euen in her name I dare promi≈øe, by the bypast experience of her happy gouernment, as I haue already ≈øaid, that no good ≈øubiect ≈øhall be more carefull to enforme her of any corruptions ≈øtollen in in her ≈øtate, then ≈øhee ≈øhall be zealous for the di≈øcharge of her con≈øcience and honour, to ≈øee the ≈øame purged, and restored to the ancient integritie; and further during her time, becomes me least of any to meddle in.</p>
               <p>And thus hauing re≈øolued all the doubts, ≈øo farre as I can imagine, may be moued against this Treati≈øe; it onely re≈øts to pray thee (charitable Reader) to interprete fauourably this birth of mine, according to the integritie of the author, and not looking for perfection in the worke it ≈øelfe. As for my part, I onely glory thereof in this point, that I trust no ≈øort of vertue is condemned, nor any degree of vice allowed in it: and that (though it be not perhaps ≈øo gorgeou≈øly decked, and richly attired as it ought to be) it is at the least rightly proportioned in all the members, without any menstrous deformitie in any of them: and ≈øpecially that ≈øince it was fir≈øt written in ≈øecret, and is now publi≈øhed, not of ambition, but of a kinde of nece≈øsitie; it must be taken of all men, for the trew image of my very minde, and forme of the rule, which I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed to my ≈øelfe and mine; Which as in all my actions I haue bitherto prea≈ø≈øed to expre≈ø≈øe, ≈øo farre as the nature of my charge, and the condition of time would permit me: ≈øo beareth it a di≈øcouery of that which may be looked for at my hand, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euen in my ≈øecret thoughts, I haue engaged my ≈øelfe for the time to come. And thus in a firme tru≈øt, that it ≈øhall plea≈øe God, who with my being and Crowne, gaue me this minde, to maintaine and augment the ≈øame in me and my po≈øteritie, to the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our con≈øcience, the maintenance of our Honour, and weale of our people, I bid thee heartily farewell.</p>

Remember, that as in dignitie hee hath erected you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue others, ≈øo ought ye in thankfulne≈ø≈øe towards him, goe as farre beyond all others. A moate in anothers eye, is a beame into yours: a blemi≈øh in another, is a leprou≈øe byle into you: and a veniall ≈øinne (as the Papi≈øts call it) in another, is a great crime into you. Thinke not therefore, that the highne≈ø≈øe of your dignitie,
<note place="margin">The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of the fault of a Prince.</note> dimmi≈øheth your faults (much le≈ø≈øe giueth you a licence to ≈øinne) but by the contrary your fault ≈øhall be aggrauated, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the height of your dignitie; any ≈øinne that ye commit, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ≈øingle ≈øinne procuring but the fall of one; but being an exemplare
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:23110:96"/>≈øinne, and therefore drawing with it the whole multitude to be guiltie of the ≈øame. Remember then, that this gli≈øtering worldly glorie of Kings,
<note place="margin">The trew glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Kings.</note> is giuen them by God, to teach them to prea≈ø≈øe ≈øo to gli≈øter and ≈øhine before their people, in all workes of ≈øanctification and righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, that their per≈øons as bright lampes of godline≈ø≈øe and vertue, may, going in and out before their people, giue light to all their ≈øteps. Remember al≈øo, that by the right knowledge, and feare of God (which is <hi>the beginning of Wi≈øedome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou 9.10.</note> as <hi>Salomon</hi> ≈øaith) ye ≈øhall know all the things nece≈ø≈øarie for the di≈øcharge of your duetie, both as a Chri≈øtian, and as a King; ≈øeeing in him, as in a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, the cour≈øe of all earthly things, whereof hee is the ≈øpring and onely moouer.</p>
               <p>Now, the onely way to bring you to this knowledge,
<note place="margin">The meanes to know God.</note> is diligently to reade his word, and earne≈øtly to pray for the right vnder≈øtanding thereof. <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> ≈øayth Chri≈øt, <hi>for they beare te≈øtimonie of me:</hi> and,
<note place="margin">Iohn 5.39.</note> 
                  <hi>the whole Scripture,</hi> ≈øaith Paul, <hi>is giuen by in≈øpiration of God, and is profitable to teach,
<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16.17.</note> to conuince, to correct, and to instruct in righteou≈øne≈øse; that the man of God may be ab≈øolute, being made perfite vnto all good workes.</hi> And mo≈øt properly of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, belongeth the reading thereof vnto Kings,
<note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> ≈øince in that part of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where the godly Kings are fir≈øt made mention of, that were ordained to rule ouer the people of God, there is an expre≈ø≈øe and mo≈øt notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation and commandement giuen them, to reade and meditate in the Law of God. I ioyne to this, the carefull hearing of the doctrine with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and reuerence: for, <hi>faith commeth by hearing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10.17.</note> ≈øayth the ≈øame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle. But aboue all, beware ye wre≈øt not the word to your owne appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, as ouer many doe, making it like a bell to ≈øound as ye plea≈øe to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete: but by the contrary, frame all your affections, to follow preci≈øely the rule there ≈øet downe.</p>
               <p>The whole Scripture chiefly containeth two things: a command,
<note place="margin">Wherein chiefely the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteth.</note> and a prohibition, to doe ≈øuch things, and to ab≈øtaine from the contrary. Obey in both; neither thinke it enough to ab≈øtaine from euill, and do no good; nor thinke not that if yee doe many good things, it may ≈øerue you for a cloake to mixe euill turnes therewith. And as in the≈øe two points, the whole Scripture principally con≈øi≈øteth,
<note place="margin">Two degrees of the ≈øeruice of God.</note> ≈øo in two degrees ≈øtandeth the whole ≈øeruice of God by man: interiour, or vpward; exteriour, or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: the fir≈øt, by prayer in faith towards God; the next, by workes flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefra before the world: which is nothing el≈øe, but the exerci≈øe of Religion towards God, and of equitie towards your neighbour.</p>
               <p>As for the particular points of Religion, I need not to dilate them; I am no hypocrite, follow my foot≈øteps,
<note place="margin">A regardable paterne.</note> and your owne pre≈øent education therein. I thanke God, I was neuer a≈øhamed to giue account of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion, how≈øoeuer the malicious lying tongues of ≈øome haue traduced me: and if my con≈øcience had not re≈øolued me, that all my Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently profe≈ø≈øed by me and my kingdome, was grounded vpon the plaine wordes of the Scripture, without the which all points of Religion are
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:23110:97"/>≈øuperfluous, as any thing contrary to the ≈øame is abomination, I had neuer outwardly auowed it, for plea≈øure or awe of any fle≈øh.</p>
               <p>And as for the points of equitie towards your neigbour (becau≈øe that will fall in properly, vpon the ≈øecond part concerning a Kings office) I leaue it to the owne roume.</p>
               <p>For the fir≈øt part then of mans ≈øeruice to his God,
<note place="margin">Religion.</note> which is Religion, that is, the wor≈øhip of God according to his reuealed will, it is wholly grounded vpon the Scripture, as I haue alreadie ≈øaid, quickened by faith, and con≈øerued by con≈øcience: For the Scripture, I haue now ≈øpoken of it in generall, but that yee may the more readily make choice of any part thereof, for your in≈øtruction or comfort, remember ≈øhortly this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode.</p>
               <p>The whole Scripture is dyted by Gods Spirit,
<note place="margin">The methode of Scripture.</note> thereby, as by his liuely word, to in≈øtruct and rule the whole Church militant to the end of the word: It is compo≈øed of two parts, the Olde and New Te≈øtament: The ground of the former is the Lawe, which ≈øheweth our ≈øinne, and contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth iu≈øtice: the ground of the other is Chri≈øt, who pardoning ≈øinne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth grace. The ≈øumme of the Law is the tenne Commandements, more largely delated in the bookes of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the Law.</note> interpreted and applied by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and by the hi≈øtories, are the examples ≈øhewed of obedience or di≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience thereto, and what <hi>praemium</hi> or <hi>poena</hi> was accordingly giuen by God: But becau≈øe no man was able to keepe the Law, nor any part thereof, it plea≈øed God of his infinite wi≈øedome and goodne≈ø≈øe, to incarnate his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sonne in our nature, for ≈øatisfaction of his iu≈øtice in his ≈øuffering for vs; that ≈øince we could not be ≈øaued by doing, we might at lea≈øt, bee ≈øaued by beleeuing.</p>
               <p>The ground therefore of the word of grace,
<note place="margin">Of Grace.</note> is contained in the foure hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtories of the birth, life, death, re≈øurrection and a≈øcention of Chri≈øt: The larger interpretation and v≈øe thereof, is contained in the Epi≈øtles of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtles: and the practi≈øe in the faithfull or vnfaithfull, with the hi≈øtorie of the infancie and fir≈øt progre≈ø≈øe of the Church is contained in their Actes.</p>
               <p>Would ye then know your ≈øinne by the Lawe?
<note place="margin">V≈øe of the Law.</note> reade the bookes of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi> containing it. Would ye haue a commentarie thereupon? Reade the Prophets, and likewi≈øe the bookes of the <hi>Prouerbes</hi> and <hi>Eccle≈øiastes,</hi> written by that great patterne of wi≈øedome <hi>Salomon;</hi> which will not only ≈øerue you for in≈øtruction, how to walke in the obedience of the Lawe of God, but is al≈øo ≈øo full of golden ≈øentences, and morall precepts, in all things that can concerne your conuer≈øation in the world, as among all the prophane Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øophers and Poets, ye ≈øhall not finde ≈øo rich a ≈øtorehou≈øe of precepts of naturall wi≈øedome, agreeing with the will and diuine wi≈øedome of God. Would ye ≈øee how good men are rewarded, and wicked puni≈øhed? looke the hi≈øtoricall parts of the≈øe ≈øame bookes of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> together with the hi≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Io≈øhua,</hi> the <hi>Iudges, Ezra, Nehemiah, E≈øther,</hi> and <hi>Iob:</hi> but e≈øpecially the bookes of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> wherewith ye ought to bee familiarly
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:23110:97"/>acquainted: for there ≈øhall yee ≈øee your ≈øelfe, as in a myrrour, in the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue either of the good or the euill Kings.</p>
               <p>Would yee know the doctrine, life, and death of our Sauiour Chri≈øt?
<note place="margin">V≈øe of the Go≈øpel.</note> reade the Euangeli≈øts. Would ye bee more particularly trained vp in his Schoole? meditate vpon the Epi≈øtles of the Apo≈øtles. And would ye be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the practi≈øes of that doctrine in the per≈øons of the primitiue Church? Ca≈øt vp the Apo≈øtles Actes. And as to the Apocryphe bookes, I omit them, becau≈øe I am no Papi≈øt, as I ≈øaid before; and indeed ≈øome of them are no wayes like the dytement of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>But when ye reade the Scripture,
<note place="margin">How to reade the Scripture.</note> reade it with a ≈øanctified and cha≈øte heart: admire reuerently ≈øuch ob≈øcure places as ye vnder≈øtand not, blaming onely your owne capacitie: read with delight the plaine places, and ≈øtudie carefully to vnder≈øtand tho≈øe that are ≈øomewhat difficile: prea≈ø≈øe to bee a good textuarie; for the Scripture is euer the be≈øt interpreter of it ≈øelfe; but prea≈ø≈øe not curiou≈øly to ≈øeeke out farther then is contained therein; for that were ouer vnmannerly a pre≈øumption, to ≈øtriue to bee further vpon Gods ≈øecrets, then he hath will ye be; for what hee thought needfull for vs to know, that hath he reuealed there: And delyte mo≈øt in reading ≈øuch parts of the Scripture, as may be≈øt ≈øerue for your in≈øtruction in your calling; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting fooli≈øh curio≈øities vpon genealogies and contentions,

               <p>Now, as to Faith, which is the nouri≈øher and quickner of Religion,
<note place="margin">Faith the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øher of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> as I haue alreadie ≈øaid, It is a ≈øure per≈øwa≈øion and apprehen≈øion of the promi≈øes of God, applying them to your ≈øoule: and therefore may it iu≈øtly be called, the golden chaine that linketh the faithfull ≈øoule to Chri≈øt: And becau≈øe it groweth not in our garden, but <hi>is the free gift of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philip. 1.29.</note> as the ≈øame Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, it mu≈øt be nouri≈øhed by prayer, Which is nothing el≈øe, but a friendly talking with God.</p>

<note place="margin">Prayer, and whence to learne the be≈øt forme thereof.</note> the P≈øalmes of <hi>Dauid</hi> are the meete≈øt ≈øchoole-ma≈øter that ye can be acquainted with (next the prayer of our Sauiour, which is the onely rule of prayer) whereout of, as of mo≈øt rich and pure fountaines, ye may learne all forme of prayer nece≈ø≈øarie for your comfort at all occa≈øions: And ≈øo much the fitter are they for you, then for the common ≈øort, in re≈øpect the compo≈øer thereof was a King: and therefore be≈øt behoued to know a Kings wants, and what things were meete≈øt to be required by a King at Gods hand for remedie thereof.</p>
               <p>V≈øe often to pray when ye are quiete≈øt,
<note place="margin">Seuerall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> e≈øpecially forget it not in your bed how oft ≈øoeuer ye doe it at other times: for publike prayer ≈øerueth as much for example, as for any particular comfort to the ≈øupplicant.</p>
               <p>In your prayer, bee neither ouer ≈øtrange with God,
<note place="margin">What rule or regard to be v≈øed in prayer.</note> like the ignorant common ≈øort, that prayeth nothing but out of bookes, nor yet ouer home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, like ≈øome of the vaine Phari≈øaicall puritanes, that thinke they rule him vpon their fingers: The former way will breede an vncouth coldne≈ø≈øe in you towards him, the other will breede in you a contempt of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:23110:98"/>him. But in your prayer to God ≈øpeake with all reuerence: for if a ≈øubiect will not ≈øpeake but reuerently to a King, much le≈ø≈øe ≈øhould any fle≈øh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume to talke with God as with his companion.</p>
               <p>Craue in your prayer, not onely things ≈øpirituall, but al≈øo things tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,

               <p>And as for con≈øcience,
<note place="margin">Con≈øcience the con≈øeruer of Religion.</note> which I called the con≈øeruer of Religion, It is nothing el≈øe, but the light of knowledge that God hath planted in man, which euer watching ouer all his actions, as it beareth him a ioyfull te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie when he does right, ≈øo choppeth it him with a feeling that hee hath done wrong, when euer he committeth any ≈øinne.

               <p>The three acce≈ø≈øories, which as I haue ≈øaid, ought al≈øo to be re≈øpected, without derogating to the principall cau≈øes, are beautie, riches, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:23110:108"/>by alliance, which are all ble≈ø≈øings of God. For beautie increa≈øeth your loue to your Wife, contenting you the better with her, without caring for others: and riches and great alliance, doe both make her the abler to be a helper vnto you. But if ouer great re≈øpect being had to the≈øe acce≈ø≈øories, the principall cau≈øes bee ouer-≈øeene (which is ouer oft practi≈øed in the world) as of them≈øelues they are a ble≈ø≈øing being well v≈øed; ≈øo the abu≈øe of them will turne them in a cur≈øe. For what can all the≈øe worldly re≈øpects auaile, when a man ≈øhall finde him≈øelfe coupled with a diuel, to be one fle≈øh with him, and the halfe marrow in his bed? Then (though too late) ≈øhall he finde that beautie without bountie, wealth without wi≈ødome, and great friend≈øhip without grace and hone≈øtie; are but faire ≈øhewes, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull ma≈øques of infinite mi≈øeries.</p>
               <p>But haue ye re≈øpect, my Sonne, to the≈øe three ≈øpeciall cau≈øes in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<note place="margin">Matth. 13. A ≈øpecial cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> which flow from the fir≈øt in≈øtitution thereof, <hi>&amp; caetera omnia adijcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur vobis.</hi> And therefore I would rathe≈øt haue you to Marie one that were fully of your owne Religion; her ranke and other qualities being agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your e≈øtate. For although that to my great regrate, the number of any Princes of power and account, profe≈ø≈øing our Religion, bee but very ≈ømall; and that therefore this aduice ≈øeemes to be the more ≈øtrait and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile: yet ye haue deeply to weigh, and con≈øider vpon the≈øe doubts, how ye and your wife can bee of one fle≈øh, and keepe vnitie betwixt you, being members of two oppo≈øite Churches: di≈øagreement in Religion bringeth euer with it, di≈øagreement in maners; and the di≈ø≈øention betwixt your Preachers and hers, wil breed and fo≈øter a di≈ø≈øention among your ≈øubiects, taking their example from your family; be≈øides the perill of the euill edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of your children. Neither pride you that ye wil be able to frame and make her as ye plea≈øe: that deceiued <hi>Salomon</hi> the wi≈øe≈øt King that euer was; the grace of Per≈øeuerance, not being a flowre that groweth in our garden.</p>
               <p>Remember al≈øo that Mariage is one of the greate≈øt actions that a man doeth in all his time, e≈øpecially in taking of his fir≈øt Wife: and if hee Marie fir≈øt ba≈øely beneath his ranke, he will euer be the le≈ø≈øe accounted of there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.

               <p>When yee are Maried, keepe inuiolably your promi≈øe made to God in your Mariage; which ≈øtandeth all in doing of one thing, and ab≈øtayning from another: to treat her in all things as your wife, and the halfe of your ≈øelfe; and to make your body (which then is no more yours, but properly hers) common with none other.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there is not a thing ≈øo nece≈ø≈øarie to be knowne by the people of any land, next the knowledge of their God, as the right knowledge of their allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, according to the forme of gouernement e≈øtabli≈øhed among them, e≈øpecially in a <hi>Monarchie</hi> (which forme of gouernment, as re≈øembling the Diuinitie, approacheth neare≈øt to perfection, as all the learned and wi≈øe men from the beginning haue agreed vpon; Vnitie being the perfection of all things,) So hath the ignorance, and (which is wor≈øe) the ≈øeduced opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the multitude blinded by them, who thinke them≈øelues able to teach and in≈øtruct the ignorants, procured the wracke and ouerthrow of ≈øundry flouri≈øhing Common-wealths; and heaped heauy calamities, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vtter de≈øtruction vpon others. And the ≈ømiling ≈øucce≈ø≈øe, that vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rebellions haue oftentimes had again≈øt Princes in aages pa≈øt (≈øuch hath bene the mi≈øery, and iniquitie of the time) hath by way of practi≈øe ≈øtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many in their errour: albeit there cannot be a more deceiueable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; then to iudge ay the iu≈øtne≈ø≈øe of the cau≈øe by the euent thereof; as hereafter ≈øhalbe proued more at length. And among others, no Common-wealth, that euer hath bene ≈øince the beginning, hath had greater need of the trew knowledge of this ground, then this our ≈øo long di≈øordered, and di≈øtracted Common-wealth hath: the misknowledge hereof being the onely ≈øpring, from whence haue flowed ≈øo many endle≈ø≈øe calamities, mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and confu≈øions, as is better felt by many, then the cau≈øe thereof well knowne, and deepely con≈øidered. The naturall zeale therefore, that I beare to this my natiue countrie, with the great pittie I haue to ≈øee the ≈øo-long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øturbance thereof for lacke of the trew knowledge of this ground (as I haue ≈øaid before) hath compelled me at la≈øt to breake ≈øilence, to di≈øcharge my
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:23110:119"/>con≈øcience to you my deare country men herein, that knowing the ground from whence the≈øe your many endle≈ø≈øe troubles haue proceeded, as well as ye haue already too-long ta≈øted the bitter fruites thereof, ye may by know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and e≈øchewing of the cau≈øe e≈øcape, and diuert the lamentable effects that euer nece≈ø≈øarily follow thereupon. I haue cho≈øen then onely to ≈øet downe in this ≈øhort Treati≈øe, the trew grounds of the mutuall duetie, and alleageance betwixt a free and ab≈øolute <hi>Monarche,</hi> and his people; not to trouble your patience with an≈øwering the contrary propo≈øitions, which ≈øome haue not bene a≈øhamed to ≈øet downe in writ, to the poy≈øoning of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of ≈øimple ≈øoules, and their owne perpetuall, and well de≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued infamie: For by an≈øwering them, I could not haue e≈øchewed whiles to pick, and byte wel ≈øaltly their per≈øons; which would rather haue bred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiou≈øne≈ø≈øe among the readers (as they had liked or mi≈øliked) then ≈øound in≈øtruction of the trewth: Which I prote≈øt to him that is the ≈øearcher of all hearts, is the onely marke that I ≈øhoot at herein.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt then, I will ≈øet downe the trew grounds, whereupon I am to build, out of the Scriptures, ≈øince <hi>Monarchie</hi> is the trew paterne of Diuinitie, as I haue already ≈øaid: next, from the fundamental Lawes of our owne King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which neare≈øt mu≈øt concerne vs: thirdly, from the law of Nature, by diuers ≈øimilitudes drawne out of the ≈øame: and will conclude ≈øyne by an≈øwering the mo≈øt waighty and appearing incommodities that can be obiected.</p>
               <p>The Princes duetie to his Subiects is ≈øo clearely ≈øet downe in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Scriptures, and ≈øo openly confe≈ø≈øed by all the good Princes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their oath in their Coronation, as not needing to be long there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I ≈øhall as ≈øhortly as I can runne through it.</p>
               <p>Kings are called Gods by the propheticall King <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I ≈øal. 82.6.</note> becau≈øe they ≈øit vpon GOD his Throne in the earth, and haue the count of their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration to giue vnto him.
<note place="margin">P≈øal. 101. P≈øal. 101. 2. King. 18. 2. Chron. 29. 2. King. 22. and 23.2. chro. 34. &amp; 35. P≈øal. 72. 1.

<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> to take vengeance vpon them that doe euill,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith. And finally,
<note place="margin">1. Sam. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>As a good Pa≈øtour, to goe out and in before his people</hi> as is ≈øaid in the fir≈øt of <hi>Samuel:
<note place="margin">Ierem. 29.</note> That through the Princes prosperitie, the peoples peace may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,</hi> as <hi>Ieremie</hi> ≈øaith.</p>
               <p>And therefore in the Coronation of our owne Kings, as well as of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chri≈øtian <hi>Monarche</hi> they giue their Oath, fir≈øt to maintaine the Religion pre≈øently profe≈ø≈øed within their countrie, according to their lawes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is e≈øtabli≈øhed, and to puni≈øh all tho≈øe that ≈øhould pre≈ø≈øe to alter, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øturbe the profe≈ø≈øion thereof; And next to maintaine all the lowable and good Lawes made by their predece≈ø≈øours: to ≈øee them put in execution,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:23110:119"/>and the breakers and violaters thereof, to be puni≈øhed, according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the ≈øame: And la≈øtly, to maintaine the whole countrey, and euery ≈øtate therein, in all their ancient Priuiledges and Liberties, as well again≈øt all forreine enemies, as among them≈øelues: And ≈øhortly to procure the weale and flouri≈øhing of his people, not onely in maintaining and putting to execution the olde lowable lawes of the countrey, and by e≈øtabli≈øhing of new (as nece≈ø≈øitie and euill maners will require) but by all other meanes po≈ø≈øible to fore-≈øee and preuent all dangers, that are likely to fall vpon them, and to maintaine concord, wealth, and ciuilitie among them, as a louing Father, and careful watchman, caring for them more then for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, knowing him≈øelfe to be ordained for them, and they not for him; and therefore countable to that great God, who placed him as his lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ouer them, vpon the perill of his ≈øoule to procure the weale of both ≈øoules and bodies, as farre as in him lieth, of all them that are committed to his charge. And this oath in the Coronation is the cleare≈øt, ciuill, and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Law, whereby the Kings office is properly defined.</p>
               <p>By the Law of Nature the King becomes a naturall Father to all his Lie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at his Coronation: And as the Father of his fatherly duty is bound to care for the nouri≈øhing, education, and vertuous gouernment of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; euen ≈øo is the king bound to care for all his ≈øubiects. As all the toile and paine that the father can take for his children, will be thought light and well be≈øtowed by him, ≈øo that the effect thereof redound to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and weale; ≈øo ought the Prince to doe towards his people. As the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father ought to fore≈øee all inconuenients and dangers that may ari≈øe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his children, and though with the hazard of his owne per≈øon pre≈ø≈øe to preuent the ≈øame; ≈øo ought the King towards his people. As the fathers wrath and correction vpon any of his children that offendeth, ought to be by a fatherly cha≈øti≈øement ≈øea≈øoned with pitie, as long as there is any hope of amendment in them; ≈øo ought the King towards any of his Lieges that offend in that mea≈øure. And ≈øhortly, as the Fathers chiefe ioy ought to be in procuring his childrens welfare, reioycing at their weale, ≈øorrowing and pitying at their euill, to hazard for their ≈øafetie, trauell for their re≈øt, wake for their ≈øleepe; and in a word, to thinke that his earthly felicitie and life ≈øtandeth and liueth more in them, nor in him≈øelfe; ≈øo ought a good Prince thinke of his people.</p>
               <p>As to the other branch of this mutuall and reciprock band, is the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and alleageance that the Lieges owe to their King: the ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I take out of the words of <hi>Samuel,</hi> dited by Gods Spirit, when God had giuen him commandement to heare the peoples voice in choo≈øing and annointing them a King. And becau≈øe that place of Scripture being well vnder≈øtood, is ≈øo pertinent for our purpo≈øe, I haue in≈øert herein the very words of the Text.</p>

               <p>That the≈øe words, and di≈øcour≈øes of <hi>Samuel</hi> were dited by Gods Spirit, it needs no further probation, but that it is a place of Scripture; ≈øince the whole Scripture is dited by that in≈øpiration, as <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith: which ground no good Chri≈øtian will, or dare denie. Whereupon it mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the≈øe ≈øpeeches proceeded not from any ambition in <hi>Samuel,</hi> as one loath to quite the reines that he ≈øo long had ruled, and therefore de≈øirous, by making odious the gouernment of a King, to di≈ø≈øwade the people from their farther importunate crauing of one: For, as the text proueth it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he then conueened them to giue them a re≈øolute grant of their demand, as God by his owne mouth commanded him, ≈øaying,
<q>Hearken to the voice of the people.</q> And to pre≈ø≈øe to di≈ø≈øwade them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> that, which he then came to grant vnto them, were a thing very impertinent in a wi≈øe man; much more in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the mo≈øt high God. And likewi≈øe, it well appeared in all the cour≈øe of his life after, that his ≈øo long refu≈øing of their ≈øute before came not of any ambition in him: which he well proued in praying, &amp; as it were importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God for the weale of <hi>Saul.</hi> Yea, after God had declared his reprobation vnto him, yet he de≈øi≈øted not, while God him≈øelfe was wrath at his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:23110:120"/>and di≈øcharged his fathers ≈øuit in that errand. And that the≈øe words of <hi>Samuel</hi> were not vttered as a prophecie of <hi>Saul</hi> their fir≈øt Kings defection, it well appeareth, as well becau≈øe we heare no mention made in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any his tyrannie and oppre≈ø≈øion, (which, if it had beene, would not haue been left vnpainted out therein, as well as his other faults were, as in a trew mirrour of all the Kings behauiours, whom it de≈øcribeth) as likewi≈øe in re≈øpect that <hi>Saul</hi> was cho≈øen by God for his vertue, and meet qualities to gouerne his people: whereas his defection ≈øprung after-hand from the corruption of his owne nature, &amp; not through any default in God, whom they that thinke ≈øo, would make as a ≈øtep-father to his people, in making wilfully a choi≈øe of the vnmeete≈øt for gouerning them, ≈øince the election of that King lay ab≈øolutely and immediatly in Gods hand. But by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it is plaine, and euident, that this ≈øpeech of <hi>Samuel</hi> to the people, was to prepare their hearts before the hand to the due obedience of that King, which God was to giue vnto them; and therefore opened vp vnto them, what might be the intollerable qualities that might fall in ≈øome of their kings, thereby preparing them to patience, not to re≈øi≈øt to Gods ordinance: but as he would haue ≈øaid; Since God hath granted your importunate ≈øuit in giuing you a king, as yee haue el≈øe committed an errour in ≈øhaking off Gods yoke, and ouer-ha≈øtie ≈øeeking of a King; ≈øo beware yee fall not into the next, in ca≈øting off al≈øo ra≈øhly that yoke, which God at your earne≈øt ≈øuite hath laid vpon you, how hard that euer it ≈øeeme to be: For as ye could not haue obtained one without the permi≈ø≈øion and ordinance of God, ≈øo may yee no more, fro hee be once ≈øet ouer you, ≈øhake him off without the ≈øame warrant. And therefore in time arme your≈øelues with patience and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, ≈øince he that hath the only power to make him, hath the onely power to vnmake him, and ye onely to obey, bearing with the≈øe ≈øtraits that I now fore≈øhew you, as with the finger of God, which lieth not in you to take off.</p>
               <p>And will ye con≈øider the very wordes of the text in order, as they are ≈øet downe, it ≈øhall plainely declare the obedience that the people owe to their King in all re≈øpects.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, God commandeth <hi>Samuel</hi> to doe two things: the one, to grant the people their ≈øuit in giuing them a king; the other, to forewarne them, what ≈øome kings will doe vnto them, that they may not thereafter in their grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and murmuring ≈øay, when they ≈øhal feele the ≈ønares here fore-≈øpoken; We would neuer haue had a king of God, in ca≈øe when we craued him, hee had let vs know how wee would haue beene v≈øed by him, as now we finde but ouer-late. And this is meant by the≈øe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now therefore hearken vnto their voice: howbeit yet testifie vnto them, and ≈øhew them the maner of the King that ≈øhall rule ouer them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And next, <hi>Samuel</hi> in execution of this commandement of God, hee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe doeth two things.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, hee declares vnto them, what points of iu≈øtice and equitie their king will breake in his behauiour vnto them: And next he putteth them
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:23110:121"/>out of hope, that wearie as they will, they ≈øhall not haue leaue to ≈øhake off that yoke, which God through their importunitie hath laide vpon them. The points of equitie that the King ≈øhall breake vnto them, are expre≈ø≈øed in the≈øe words:

               <p>As if he would ≈øay; The be≈øt and noble≈øt of your blood ≈øhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled in ≈ølaui≈øh and ≈øeruile offices to ≈øerue him: And not content of his owne patrimonie, will make vp a rent to his owne v≈øe out of your be≈øt lands, vineyards, orchards, and ≈øtore of cattell: So as inuerting the Law of nature, and office of a King, your per≈øons and the per≈øons of your po≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, together with your lands, and all that ye po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe ≈øhal ≈øerue his priuate v≈øe, and inordinate appetite.</p>

               <p>Now then, ≈øince the erection of this Kingdome and Monarchie among the Iewes, and the law thereof may, and ought to bee a paterne to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian and well founded Monarchies, as beeing founded by God him≈øelfe, who by his Oracle, and out of his owne mouth gaue the law thereof: what liberty can broiling ≈øpirits, and rebellious minds claime iu≈øtly to again≈øt any Chri≈øtian Monarchie; ≈øince they can claime to no greater libertie on their part, nor the people of God might haue done, and no greater tyranny was euer executed by any Prince or tyrant, whom they can obiect, nor was here fore-warned to the people of God, (and yet all rebellion counterman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto them) if tyrannizing ouer mens per≈øons, ≈øonnes, daughters and ≈øeruants; redacting noble hou≈øes, and men, and women of noble blood, to ≈ølaui≈øh and ≈øcruile offices; and extortion, and ≈øpoile of their lands and goods to the princes owne priuate v≈øe and commoditie, and of his courteours, and ≈øeruants, may be called a tyrannie?</p>
               <p>And that this propo≈øition grounded vpon the Scripture, may the more clearely appeare to be trew by the practi≈øe often prooued in the ≈øame booke, we neuer reade, that euer the Prophets per≈øwaded the people to rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Prince, how wicked ≈øoeuer he was.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Samuel</hi> by Gods command pronounced to the ≈øame king <hi>Saul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15.</note> that his kingdome was rent from him, and giuen to another (which in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was a degrading of him) yet his next action following that, was peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to turne home, and with floods of teares to pray to God to haue ≈øome compa≈ø≈øion vpon him.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Dauid,</hi> notwith≈øtanding hee was inaugurate in that ≈øame degraded Kings roome, not onely (when he was cruelly per≈øecuted, for no offence; but good ≈øeruice done vnto him) would not pre≈øume, hauing him in his power, skantly, but with great reuerence, to touch the garment of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted of the Lord, and in his words ble≈ø≈øed him: but likewi≈øe,
<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2 4. 2. Sam. 1.</note> when one came to him vanting him≈øelfe vntrewly to haue ≈ølaine <hi>Saul,</hi> hee, without forme of proces, or triall of his guilt, cau≈øed onely for guiltine≈ø≈øe of his tongue, put him to ≈øodaine death.</p>
               <p>And although there was neuer a more mon≈øtrous per≈øecutor, and tyrant nor <hi>Achab</hi> was: yet all the rebellion, that <hi>Elias</hi> euer rai≈øed again≈øt him, was to flie to the wildernes: where for fault of ≈øu≈øtentation, he was fed with the Corbies. And I thinke no man will doubt but <hi>Samuel, Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> had as great power to per≈øwade the people, if they had liked to haue employed their credite to vproares &amp; rebellions again≈øt the≈øe wicked kings, as any of our ≈øeditious preachers in the≈øe daies of what≈øoeuer religion, either in this countrey or in France, had, that bu≈øied them≈øelues mo≈øt to ≈øtir vp rebellion vnder cloake of religion. This farre the only loue of veritie, I prote≈øt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:23110:122"/>hatred at their per≈øons, haue mooued me to be ≈øomewhat ≈øatyricke.</p>
               <p>And if any will leane to the extraordinarie examples of degrading or killing of kings in the Scriptures, thereby to cloake the peoples rebellion, as by the deed of <hi>Iehu,</hi> and ≈øuch like extraordinaries: I an≈øwere, be≈øides that they want the like warrant that they had, if extraordinarie examples of the Scripture ≈øhall bee drawne in daily practi≈øe; murther vnder trai≈øt as in the per≈øons of <hi>Ahud,</hi> and <hi>Iael;</hi> theft, as in the per≈øons of the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> comming out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> lying to their parents to the hurt of their brother, as in the per≈øon of <hi>Iacob,</hi> ≈øhall all be counted as lawfull and allowable vertues, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion again≈øt Princes. And to conclude, the practi≈øe through the whole Scripture prooueth the peoples obedience giuen to that ≈øentence in the law of God:
<q>Thou ≈øhalt not rayle vpon the Iudges, neither ≈øpeake euill of the ruler of thy people.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To end then the ground of my propo≈øition taken out of the Scripture, let two ≈øpeciall, and notable examples, one vnder the law, another vnder the Euangel,
<note place="margin">Ier. 27.</note> conclude this part of my alleageance. Vnder the lawe, <hi>Ieremie</hi> threatneth the people of God with vtter de≈øtruction for rebellion to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezar</hi> the king of Babel: who although he was an idolatrous per≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a forraine King, a Tyrant, and v≈øurper of their liberties; yet in re≈øpect they had once receiued and acknowledged him for their king, he not only commandeth them to obey him,
<note place="margin">Iere. 29.</note> but euen to pray for his pro≈øperitie, adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the rea≈øon to it; becau≈øe in his pro≈øperitie ≈øtood their peace.</p>
               <p>And vnder the Euangel, that king, whom <hi>Paul</hi> bids the <hi>Romanes obey</hi> and ≈øerue <hi>for con≈øcience ≈øake,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 13.</note> was <hi>Nero</hi> that bloody tyrant, an infamie to his aage, and a mon≈øter to the world, being al≈øo an idolatrous per≈øecuter, as the King of <hi>Babel</hi> was. If then Idolatrie and defection from God, tyranny o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their people, and per≈øecution of the Saints, for their profe≈ø≈øion ≈øake, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred not the Spirit of God to command his people vnder all highe≈øt paine to giue them all due and heartie obedience for con≈øcience ≈øake, giuing to <hi>Cae≈øar</hi> that which was <hi>Cae≈øars,</hi> and to God that which was Gods, as Chri≈øt ≈øaith; and that this practi≈øe throughout the booke of God agreeth with this lawe, which he made in the erection of that Monarchie (as is at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deduced) what ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe pre≈øumption is it to any Chri≈øtian people now adayes to claime to that vnlawfull libertie, which God refu≈øed to his owne peculiar and cho≈øen people? Shortly then to take vp in two or three ≈øentences, grounded vpon all the≈øe arguments, out of the lawe of God, the duetie, and alleageance of the people to their lawfull king, their obedience, I ≈øay, ought to be to him, as to Gods Lieutenant in earth, obeying his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in all things, except directly again≈øt God, as the commands of Gods Mini≈øter, acknowledging him a Iudge ≈øet by GOD ouer them, hauing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to iudge them, but to be iudged onely by GOD, whom to onely hee mu≈øt giue count of his iudgement; fearing him as their Iudge; louing him as their father; praying for him as their protectour; for his continuance, if
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:23110:122"/>he be good; for his amendement, if he be wicked; following and obeying his lawfull commaunds, e≈øchewing and flying his fury in his vnlawfull, without re≈øi≈øtance, but by ≈øobbes and teares to God, according to that ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence v≈øed in the primitiue Church in the time of the per≈øecution.</p>
               <q>Preces, &amp; Lachrymae ≈øunt arma Eccle≈øiae.</q>
               <p>Now, as for the de≈øcribing the alleageance, that the lieges owe to their natiue King, out of the fundamentall and ciuill Lawe, e≈øpecially of this countrey, as I promi≈øed, the ground mu≈øt fir≈øt be ≈øet downe of the fir≈øt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of e≈øtabli≈øhing the Lawes and forme of gouernement among vs; that the ground being fir≈øt right laide, we may thereafter build rightly thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Although it be trew (according to the affirmation of tho≈øe that pryde them≈øelues to be the ≈øcourges of Tyrants) that in the fir≈øt beginning of Kings ri≈øing among Gentiles, in the time of the fir≈øt aage, diuers common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths and ≈øocieties of men choo≈øed out one among them≈øelues, who for his vertues and valour, being more eminent then the re≈øt, was cho≈øen out by them, and ≈øet vp in that roome, to maintaine the weake≈øt in their right, to throw downe oppre≈ø≈øours, and to fo≈øter and continue the ≈øocietie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men; which could not otherwi≈øe, but by vertue of that vnitie be wel done: yet the≈øe examples are nothing pertinent to vs; becau≈øe our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and diuers other Monarchies are not in that ca≈øe, but had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in a farre contrary fa≈øhion.</p>
               <p>For as our Chronicles beare witne≈ø≈øe, this Ile, and e≈øpecially our part of it, being ≈øcantly inhabited, but by very few, and they as barbarous and ≈øcant of ciuilitie, as number, there comes our fir≈øt King <hi>Fergus,</hi> with a great number with him, out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was long inhabited before vs, and making him≈øelfe ma≈øter of the countrey, by his owne friend≈øhip, and force, as well of the <hi>Ireland-men</hi> that came with him, as of the countrey-men that willingly fell to him, hee made him≈øelfe King and Lord, as well of the whole landes, as of the whole inhabitants within the ≈øame. Thereafter he and his ≈øucce≈ø≈øours, a long while after their being Kinges, made and e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhed their lawes from time to time, and as the occa≈øion required. So the trewth is directly contrarie in our ≈øtate to the fal≈øe affirmation of ≈øuch ≈øedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious writers, as would per≈øwade vs, that the Lawes and ≈øtate of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey were e≈øtabli≈øhed before the admitting of a king: where by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ye ≈øee it plainely prooued, that a wi≈øe king comming in among barbares, fir≈øt e≈øtabli≈øhed the e≈øtate and forme of gouernement, and thereafter made lawes by him≈øelfe, and his ≈øucce≈ø≈øours according thereto.</p>
               <p>The kings therefore in <hi>Scotland</hi> were before any e≈øtates or rankes of men within the ≈øame, before any Parliaments were holden, or lawes made: and by them was the land di≈øtributed (which at the fir≈øt was whole theirs) ≈øtates erected and decerned, and formes of gouernement deui≈øed and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtabli≈øhed: And ≈øo it followes of nece≈ø≈øitie, that the kings were the authors and makers of the Lawes, and not the Lawes of the kings. And to prooue this my a≈ø≈øertion more clearly, it is euident by the rolles of our Chancellery
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:23110:123"/>(which containe our elde≈øt and fundamentall Lawes) that the King is <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus omnium bonorum,</hi> and <hi>Dominus directus totius Dominij,</hi> the whole ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects being but his va≈ø≈øals, and from him holding all their lands as their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-lord, who according to good ≈øeruices done vnto him, chaungeth their holdings from tacke to few, from ward to blanch, erecteth new Baronies, and vniteth olde, without aduice or authoritie of either Parliament, or any other ≈øubalterin iudiciall ≈øeate: So as if wrong might bee admitted in play (albeit I grant wrong ≈øhould be wrong in all per≈øons) the King might haue a better colour for his plea≈øure, without further rea≈øon, to take the land from his lieges, as ouer-lord of the whole, and doe with it as plea≈øeth him, ≈øince all that they hold is of him, then, as fooli≈øh writers ≈øay, the people might vnmake the king, and put an other in his roome: But either of them as vnlawful, and again≈øt the ordinance of God, ought to be alike odious to be thought, much le≈ø≈øe put in practi≈øe.</p>
               <p>And according to the≈øe fundamentall Lawes already alledged, we daily ≈øee that in the Parliament (which is nothing el≈øe but the head Court of the king and his va≈ø≈øals) the lawes are but craued by his ≈øubiects, and onely made by him at their rogation, and with their aduice: For albeit the king make daily ≈øtatutes and ordinances, enioyning ≈øuch paines thereto as hee thinkes meet, without any aduice of Parliament or e≈øtates; yet it lies in the power of no Parliament, to make any kinde of Lawe or Statute, without his Scepter be to it, for giuing it the force of a Law: And although diuers changes haue beene in other countries of the blood Royall, and kingly hou≈øe, the kingdome being reft by conque≈øt from one to another, as in our neighbour countrey in <hi>England,</hi> (which was neuer in ours) yet the ≈øame ground of the kings right ouer all the land, and ≈øubiects thereof remaineth alike in all other free Monarchies, as well as in this: For when the Ba≈øtard of <hi>Normandie</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> and made him≈øelfe king, was it not by force, and with a mighty army? Where he gaue the Law, and tooke none, changed the Lawes, inuerted the order of gouernement, ≈øet downe the ≈øtrangers his followers in many of the old po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øours roomes, as at this day well appeareth a great part of the Gentlemen in <hi>England,</hi> beeing come of the <hi>Norman</hi> blood, and their old Lawes, which to this day they are ruled by, are written in his language, and not in theirs: And yet his ≈øucce≈ø≈øours haue with great happine≈ø≈øe enioyed the Crowne to this day; Whereof the like was al≈øo done by all them that conque≈øted them before.</p>
               <p>And for conclu≈øion of this point, that the king is ouer-lord ouer the whole lands, it is likewi≈øe daily proued by the Law of our hoordes, of want of Heires, and of Ba≈øtardies: For if a hoord be found vnder the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it is no more in the keeping or v≈øe of any per≈øon, it of the law pertains to the king. If a per≈øon, inheritour of any lands or goods, dye without any ≈øort of heires, all his landes and goods returne to the king. And if a ba≈øtard die vnrehabled without heires of his bodie (which rehabling one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lyes in the kings hands) all that hee hath likewi≈øe returnes to the king.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:23110:123"/>And as ye ≈øee it manife≈øt, that the King is ouer-Lord of the whole land: ≈øo is he Ma≈øter ouer euery per≈øon that inhabiteth the ≈øame, hauing power ouer the life and death of euery one of them: For although a iu≈øt Prince will not take the life of any of his ≈øubiects without a cleare law; yet the ≈øame lawes whereby he taketh them, are made by him≈øelfe, or his predece≈ø≈øours; and ≈øo the power flowes alwaies from him ≈øelfe; as by daily experience we ≈øee, good and iu≈øt Princes will from time to time make new lawes and ≈øtatutes, adioyning the penalties to the breakers thereof, which before the law was made, had beene no crime to the ≈øubiect to haue committed. Not that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the old definition of a King, and of a law; which makes the king to bee a ≈øpeaking law, and the Law a dumbe king: for certainely a king that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes not by his lawe, can neither be countable to God for his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration, nor haue a happy and e≈øtabli≈øhed raigne: For albeit it be trew that I haue at length prooued, that the King is aboue the law, as both the author and giuer of ≈øtrength thereto; yet a good king will not onely delight to rule his ≈øubiects by the lawe, but euen will conforme him≈øelfe in his owne actions thereuneto, alwaies keeping that ground, that the health of the common-wealth be his chiefe lawe: And where he ≈øees the lawe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome or rigorous, hee may interpret or mitigate the ≈øame, le≈øt otherwi≈øe <hi>Summum ius</hi> bee <hi>≈øumma iniuria:</hi> And therefore generall lawes, made publikely in Parliament, may vpon knowen re≈øpects to the King by his authoritie bee mitigated, and ≈øu≈øpended vpon cau≈øes onely knowen to him.</p>
               <p>As likewi≈øe, although I haue ≈øaid, a good king will frame all his actions to be according to the Law; yet is hee not bound thereto but of his good will, and for good example-giuing to his ≈øubiects: For as in the law of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtaining from eating of fle≈øh in <hi>Lenton,</hi> the king will, for examples ≈øake, make his owne hou≈øe to ob≈øerue the Law; yet no man will thinke he needs to take a licence to eate fle≈øh. And although by our Lawes, the bearing and wearing of hag-buts, and pi≈øtolets be forbidden, yet no man can find any fault in the King, for cau≈øing his traine v≈øe them in any raide vpon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, or other malefactours or rebellious ≈øubiects. So as I haue alreadie ≈øaid, a good King, although hee be aboue the Law, will ≈øubiect and frame his actions thereto, for examples ≈øake to his ≈øubiects, and of his owne free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, but not as ≈øubiect or bound thereto.</p>
               <p>Since I haue ≈øo clearely prooued then out of the fundamentall lawes and practi≈øe of this country, what right &amp; power a king hath ouer his land and ≈øubiects, it is ea≈øie to be vnder≈øtood, what allegeance &amp; obedience his lieges owe vnto him; I meane alwaies of ≈øuch free Monarchies as our king is, and not of electiue kings, and much le≈ø≈øe of ≈øuch ≈øort of gouernors, as the dukes of <hi>Venice</hi> are, who≈øe Ari≈øtocratick and limited gouernment, is nothing like to free Monarchies; although the malice of ≈øome writers hath not beene a≈øhamed to mis-know any difference to be betwixt them. And if it be not lawfull to any particular Lordes tenants or va≈ø≈øals, vpon what≈øoeuer
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:23110:124"/>pretext, to controll and di≈øplace their Ma≈øter, and ouer-lord (as is clearer nor the Sunne by all Lawes of the world) how much le≈ø≈øe may the ≈øubiects and va≈ø≈øals of the great ouer-lord the KING controll or di≈øplace him? And ≈øince in all inferiour iudgements in the land, the people may not vpon any re≈øpects di≈øplace their Magi≈øtrates, although but ≈øubaltern: for the people of a borough, cannot di≈øplace their Prouo≈øt before the time of their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: nor in Eccle≈øia≈øticall policie the flocke can vpon any pretence di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place the Pa≈øtor, nor iudge of him: yea euen the poore Schoolema≈øter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be di≈øplaced by his ≈øchollers: If the≈øe, I ≈øay (whereof ≈øome are but infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, ≈øubaltern, and temporall Magi≈øtrates, and none of them equall in any ≈øort to the dignitie of a King) cannot be di≈øplaced for any occa≈øion or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text by them that are ruled by them: how much le≈ø≈øe is it lawfull vpon any pretext to controll or di≈øplace the great Prouo≈øt, and great Schoole-ma≈øter of the whole land: except by inuerting the order of all Law and rea≈øon, the commanded may be made to command their commander, the iudged to iudge their Iudge, and they that are gouerned, to gouerne their time about their Lord and gouernour.</p>
               <p>And the agreement of the Law of nature in this our ground with the Lawes and con≈øtitutions of God, and man, already alledged, will by two ≈øimilitudes ea≈øily appeare. The King towards his people is rightly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a father of children, and to a head of a body compo≈øed of diuers members: For as fathers, the good Princes, and Magi≈øtrates of the people of God acknowledged them≈øelues to their ≈øubiects. And for all other well ruled Common-wealths, the ≈øtile of <hi>Pater patriae</hi> was euer, and is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly v≈øed to Kings. And the proper office of a King towards his Subiects, agrees very wel with the office of the head towards the body, and all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof: For from the head, being the ≈øeate of Iudgement, proceedeth the care and fore≈øight of guiding, and preuenting all euill that may come to the body or any part thereof. The head cares for the body, ≈øo doeth the King for his people. As the di≈øcour≈øe and direction flowes from the head, and the execution according thereunto belongs to the re≈øt of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, euery one according to their office: ≈øo is it betwixt a wi≈øe Prince, and his people. As the iudgement comming from the head may not onely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the members, euery one in their owne office, as long as they are able for it; but likewi≈øe in ca≈øe any of them be affected with any infirmitie mu≈øt care and prouide for their remedy, in-ca≈øe it be curable, and if otherwi≈øe, gar cut them off for feare of infecting of the re≈øt: euen ≈øo is it betwixt the Prince, and his people. And as there is euer hope of curing any di≈øea≈øed member by the direction of the head, as long as it is whole; but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if it be troubled, all the members are partakers of that paine, ≈øo is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Prince and his people.</p>
               <p>And now fir≈øt for the fathers part (who≈øe naturall loue to his children I de≈øcribed in the fir≈øt part of this my di≈øcour≈øe, ≈øpeaking of the dutie that Kings owe to their Subiects) con≈øider, I pray you what duetie his children
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:23110:124"/>owe to him, &amp; whether vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> any pretext what≈øoeuer, it wil not be thought mon≈øtrous and vnnaturall to his ≈øons, to ri≈øe vp again≈øt him, to control him at their appetite, and when they thinke good to ≈øley him, or to cut him off, and adopt to them≈øelues any other they plea≈øe in his roome: Or can any pretence of wickednes or rigor on his part be a iu≈øt excu≈øe for his children to put hand into him? And although wee ≈øee by the cour≈øe of nature, that loue v≈øeth to de≈øcend more then to a≈øcend, in ca≈øe it were trew, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hated and wronged the children neuer ≈øo much, will any man, endued with the lea≈øt ≈øponke of rea≈øon, thinke it lawfull for them to meet him with the line? Yea, ≈øuppo≈øe the father were furiou≈øly following his ≈øonnes with a drawen ≈øword, is it lawfull for them to turne and ≈øtrike againe, or make any re≈øi≈øtance but by flight? I thinke ≈øurely, if there were no more but the example of bruit bea≈øts &amp; vnrea≈øonable creatures, it may ≈øerue well enough to qualifie and proue this my argnment. We reade often the pietie that the Storkes haue to their olde and decayed parents: And generally wee know, that there are many ≈øorts of bea≈øts and fowles, that with violence and many bloody ≈øtrokes will beat and bani≈øh their yong ones from them, how ≈øoone they perceiue them to be able to fend them≈øelues; but wee neuer read or heard of any re≈øi≈øtance on their part, except among the vipers; which prooues ≈øuch per≈øons, as ought to be rea≈øonable creatures, and yet vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follow this example, to be endued with their viperous nature.</p>
               <p>And for the ≈øimilitude of the head and the body, it may very well fall out that the head will be forced to garre cut off ≈øome rotten member (as I haue already ≈øaid) to keepe the re≈øt of the body in integritie: but what ≈øtate the body can be in, if the head, for any infirmitie that can fall to it, be cut off, I leaue it to the readers iudgement.</p>
               <p>So as (to conclude this part) if the children may vpon any pretext that can be imagined, lawfully ri≈øe vp again≈øt their Father, cut him off, &amp; choo≈øe any other whom they plea≈øe in his roome; and if the body for the weale of it, may for any infirmitie that can be in the head, ≈øtrike it off, then I cannot deny that the people may rebell, controll, and di≈øplace, or cut off their king at their owne plea≈øure, and vpon re≈øpects moouing them. And whether the≈øe ≈øimilitudes repre≈øent better the office of a King, or the offices of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters or Deacons of crafts, or Doctors in Phy≈øicke (which iolly compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons are v≈øed by ≈øuch writers as maintaine the contrary propo≈øition) I leaue it al≈øo to the readers di≈øcretion.</p>
               <p>And in ca≈øe any doubts might ari≈øe in any part of this treati≈øe, I wil (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my promi≈øe) with the ≈øolution of foure principall and mo≈øt weightie doubts, that the aduer≈øaries may obiect, conclude this di≈øcour≈øe. And fir≈øt it is ca≈øten vp by diuers, that employ their pennes vpon Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies for rebellions and trea≈øons that euery man is borne to carry ≈øuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall zeale and duety to his common-wealth, as to his mother; that ≈øeeing it ≈øo rent and deadly wounded, as whiles it will be by wicked and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Kings, good Citizens will be forced, for the naturall zeale and duety
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:23110:125"/>they owe to their owne natiue countrey, to put their hand to worke for freeing their common-wealth from ≈øuch a pe≈øt.</p>
               <p>Whereunto I giue two an≈øweres: Fir≈øt, it is a ≈øure Axiome in <hi>Theologie,</hi> that euill ≈øhould not be done, that good may come of it: The wickedne≈ø≈øe therefore of the King can neuer make them that are ordained to be iudged by him, to become his Iudges. And if it be not lawfull to a priuate man to reuenge his priuate iniury vpon his priuate aduer≈øary (≈øince God hath one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen the ≈øword to the Magi≈øtrate) how much le≈ø≈øe is it lawfull to the people, or any part of them (who all are but priuate men, the authoritie being alwayes with the Magi≈øtrate, as I haue already proued) to take vpon them the v≈øe of the ≈øword, whom to it belongs not, again≈øt the publicke Magi≈øtrate, whom to onely it belongeth.</p>
               <p>Next, in place of relieuing the common-wealth out of di≈øtre≈ø≈øe (which is their onely excu≈øe and colour) they ≈øhall heape double di≈øtre≈ø≈øe and de≈øola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon it; and ≈øo their rebellion ≈øhall procure the contrary effects that they pretend it for: For a king cannot be imagined to be ≈øo vnruly and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous, but the common-wealth will be kept in better order, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding thereof, by him, then it can be by his way-taking. For fir≈øt, all ≈øudden mutations are perillous in common-wealths, hope being thereby giuen to all bare men to ≈øet vp them≈øelues, and flie with other mens fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the reines being loo≈øed to all the in≈øolencies that di≈øordered people can commit by hope of impunitie, becau≈øe of the loo≈øene≈ø≈øe of all things.</p>
               <p>And next, it is certaine that a king can neuer be ≈øo mon≈øtrou≈øly vicious, but hee will generally fauour iu≈øtice, and maintaine ≈øome order, except in the particulars, wherein his inordinate lu≈øtes and pa≈ø≈øions cary him away; where by the contrary, no King being, nothing is vnlawfull to none: And ≈øo the olde opinion of the Philo≈øophers prooues trew, That better it is to liue in a Common-wealth, where nothing is lawfull, then where all things are lawfull to all men; the Common-wealth at that time re≈øembling an vndanted young hor≈øe that hath ca≈øten his rider: For as the diuine Poet DV BARTAS ≈øayth, <hi>Better it were to ≈øuffer ≈øome di≈øorder in the e≈øtate, and ≈øome ≈øpots in the Common-wealth, then in pretending to reforme, vtterly to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Republicke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ≈øecond obiection they ground vpon the cur≈øe that hangs ouer the common-wealth, where a wicked king reigneth: and, ≈øay they, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a more acceptable deed in the ≈øight of God, nor more dutiful to their common-weale, then to free the countrey of ≈øuch a cur≈øe, and vindicate to them their libertie, which is naturall to all creatures to craue.</p>
               <p>Whereunto for an≈øwere, I grant indeed, that a wicked king is ≈øent by God for a cur≈øe to his people, and a plague for their ≈øinnes: but that it is lawfull to them to ≈øhake off that cur≈øe at their owne hand, which God hath laid on them, that I deny, and may ≈øo do iu≈øtly. Will any deny that the king of <hi>Babel</hi> was a cur≈øe to the people of God, as was plainly fore-≈øpoken and threatned vnto them in the prophecie of their captiuitie? And what was <hi>Nero</hi> to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:23110:125"/>the Chri≈øtian Church in his time? And yet <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> (as yee haue el≈øe heard) commanded them not onely to obey them, but heartily to pray for their welfare.</p>
               <p>It is certaine then (as I haue already by the Law of God ≈øufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) that patience, earne≈øt prayers to God, and amendment of their liues, are the onely lawful meanes to moue God to relieue them of that heauie cur≈øe. As for vindicating to them≈øelues their owne libertie, what lawfull power haue they to reuoke to them≈øelues againe tho≈øe priuiledges, which by their owne con≈øent before were ≈øo fully put out of their hands? for if a Prince cannot iu≈øtly bring backe againe to him≈øelf the priuiledges once be≈øtowed by him or his predece≈ø≈øors vpon any ≈øtate or ranke of his ≈øubiects; how much le≈ø≈øe may the ≈øubiects reaue out of the princes hand that ≈øuperioritie, which he and his Predece≈ø≈øors haue ≈øo long brooked ouer them?</p>
               <p>But the vnhappy iniquitie of the time, which hath oft times giuen ouer good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe to their trea≈øonable attempts, furni≈øheth them the ground of their third obiection: For, ≈øay they, the fortunate ≈øucce≈ø≈øe that God hath ≈øo oft giuen to ≈øuch enterpri≈øes, prooueth plainely by the practi≈øe, that God fauoured the iu≈øtne≈ø≈øe of their quarrell.</p>
               <p>To the which I an≈øwere, that it is trew indeed, that all the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, as well as other worldly things, lyeth onely in Gods hand: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that in the Scripture he takes to him≈øelfe the ≈øtyle of God of Ho≈øts. But vpon that generall to conclude, that hee euer giues victory to the iu≈øt quarrell, would prooue the <hi>Philistims,</hi> and diuers other neighbour enemies of the people of God to haue oft times had the iu≈øt quarrel again≈øt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, in re≈øpect of the many victories they obtained again≈øt them. And by that ≈øame argument they had al≈øo iu≈øt quarrell again≈øt the Arke of God: For they wan it in the field, and kept it long pri≈øoner in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. As likewi≈øe by all good Writers, as well Theologues, as other, the Duels and ≈øingular combats are di≈øallowed; which are onely made vpon pretence, that GOD will kith thereby the iu≈øtice of the quarrell: For wee mu≈øt con≈øider that the innocent partie is not innocent before God: And therefore God will make oft times them that haue the wrong ≈øide reuenge iu≈øtly his quarrell; and when he hath done, ca≈øt his ≈øcourge in the fire; as he oft times did to his owne people, ≈øtirring vp and ≈øtrengthening their enemies, while they were humbled in his ≈øight, and then deliuered them in their hands. So God, as the great Iudge may iu≈øtly puni≈øh his Deputie, and for his rebellion again≈øt him, ≈øtir vp his rebels to meet him with the like: And when it is done, the part of the in≈øtrument is no better then the diuels part is in tempting and torturing ≈øuch as God committeth to him as his hangman to doe: Therefore, as I ≈øaid in the beginning, it is oft times a very deceiueable argument, to iudge of the cau≈øe by the euent.</p>
               <p>And the la≈øt obiection is grounded vpon the mutuall paction and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtipulation (as they call it) betwixt the King and his people, at the time of his coronation: For there, ≈øay they, there is a mutuall paction, and contract
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:23110:126"/>bound vp, and ≈øworne betwixt the king, and the people: Whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that if the one part of the contract or the Indent bee broken vpon the Kings ≈øide, the people are no longer bound to keepe their part of it, but are thereby freed of their oath: For (≈øay they) a contract betwixt two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of all Law frees the one partie, if the other breake vnto him.</p>
               <p>As to this contract alledged made at the coronation of a King, although I deny any ≈øuch contract to bee made then, e≈øpecially containing ≈øuch a clau≈øe irritant as they alledge; yet I confe≈ø≈øe, that a king at his coronation, or at the entry to his kingdome, willingly promi≈øeth to his people, to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge honorably and trewly the office giuen him by God ouer them: But pre≈øuming that thereafter he breake his promi≈øe vnto them neuer ≈øo inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øable; the que≈øtion is, who ≈øhould bee iudge of the breake, giuing vnto them, this contractwere made vnto them neuer ≈øo ≈øicker, according to their alleageance. I thinke no man that hath but the ≈ømalle≈øt entrance into the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Law, will doubt that of all Law, either ciuil or municipal of any nation, a contract cannot be thought broken by the one partie, and ≈øo the other likewi≈øe to be freed therefro, except that fir≈øt a lawfull triall and cognition be had by the ordinary Iudge of the breakers thereof: Or el≈øe euery man may be both party and Iudge in his owne cau≈øe; which is ab≈øurd once to be thought. Now in this contract (I ≈øay) betwixt the king and his people, God is doubtles the only Iudge, both becau≈øe to him onely the king mu≈øt make count of his admini≈øtration (as is oft ≈øaid before) as likewi≈øe by the oath in the coronation, God is made iudge and reuenger of the breakers: For in his pre≈øence, as only iudge of oaths, all oaths ought to be made. Then ≈øince God is the onely Iudge betwixt the two parties contractors, the cognition and reuenge mu≈øt onely appertaine to him: It followes therefore of nece≈ø≈øitie, that God mu≈øt fir≈øt giue ≈øentence vpon the King that breaketh, before the people can thinke them≈øelues freed of their oath. What iu≈øtice then is it, that the partie ≈øhall be both iudge and partie, v≈øurping vpon him≈øelfe the office of God, may by this argument ea≈øily appeare: And ≈øhall it lie in the hands of headle≈ø≈øe multitude, when they plea≈øe to weary off ≈øubiection, to ca≈øt off the yoake of gouernement that God hath laid vpon them; to iudge and puni≈øh him, whom-by they ≈øhould be iudged and puni≈øhed; and in that ca≈øe, wherein by their violence they kythe them≈øelues to be mo≈øt pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øionate parties, to v≈øe the office of an vngracious Iudge or Arbiter? Nay, to ≈øpeake trewly of that ca≈øe, as it ≈øtands betwixt the king and his people, none of them ought to iudge of the others breake: For con≈øidering rightly the two parties at the time of their mutuall promi≈øe, the king is the one party, and the whole people in one body are the other party. And therfore ≈øince it is certaine, that a king, in ca≈øe ≈øo it ≈øhould fal out, that his people in one body had rebelled again≈øt him, hee ≈øhould not in that ca≈øe, as thinking him≈øelfe free of his promi≈øe and oath; become an vtter enemy, and practi≈øe the wreake of his whole people and natiue country: although he ought iu≈øtly to puni≈øh the principall authours and bellowes of that vniuer≈øall rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion:
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:23110:126"/>how much le≈ø≈øe then ought the people (that are alwaies ≈øubiect vnto him, and naked of all authoritie on their part) pre≈ø≈øe to iudge and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw him? otherwi≈øe the people, as the one partie contracters, ≈øhall no ≈øooner challenge the king as breaker, but hee a≈ø≈øoone ≈øhall iudge them as breakers: ≈øo as the victors making the tyners the traitors (as our prouerbe is) the partie ≈øhall aye become both iudge and partie in his owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as I haue alreadie ≈øaid.</p>
               <p>And it is here likewi≈øe to be noted, that the duty and alleageance, which the people ≈øweareth to their prince, is not only bound to them≈øelues, but likewi≈øe to their lawfull heires and po≈øterity, the lineall ≈øucce≈ø≈øio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of crowns being begun among the people of God, and happily continued in diuers chri≈øtian common-wealths: So as no obiection either of here≈øie, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoeuer priuate ≈øtatute or law may free the people from their oath-giuing to their king, and his ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, e≈øtabli≈øhed by the old fundamentall lawes of the kingdome: For, as hee is their heritable ouer-lord, and ≈øo by birth, not by any right in the coronation, commeth to his crowne, it is a like vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful (the crowne euer ≈øtanding full) to di≈øplace him that ≈øucceedeth thereto, as to eiect the former: For at the very moment of the expiring of the king reigning, the neare≈øt and lawful heire entreth in his place: And ≈øo to refu≈øe him, or intrude another, is not to holde out vncomming in, but to expell and put out their righteous King. And I tru≈øt at this time whole <hi>France</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the ≈øuper≈øtitious rebellion of the liguers, who vpon pretence of here≈øie, by force of armes held ≈øo long out, to the great de≈øolation of their whole countrey, their natiue and righteous king from po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing of his owne crowne and naturall kingdome.</p>
               <p>Not that by all this former di≈øcour≈øe of mine, and Apologie for kings, I meane that what≈øoeuer errors and intollerable abominations a ≈øouereigne prince commit, hee ought to e≈øcape all puni≈øhment, as if thereby the world were only ordained for kings, &amp; they without controlment to turne it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide down at their plea≈øure: but by the contrary, by remitting them to God (who is their onely ordinary Iudge) I remit them to the ≈øoreit and ≈øharpe≈øt ≈øchoolema≈øter that can be deui≈øed for them: for the further a king is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God aboue all other ranks &amp; degrees of men, and the higher that his ≈øeat is aboue theirs, the greater is his obligation to his maker. And therfore in ca≈øe he forget him≈øelfe (his vnthankfulnes being in the ≈øame mea≈øure of height) the ≈øadder and ≈øharper will his correction be; and according to the greatnes of the height he is in, the weight of his fall wil reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pen≈øe the ≈øame: for the further that any per≈øon is obliged to God, his offence becomes and growes ≈øo much the greater, then it would be in any other. <hi>Ioues</hi> thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps light oftner and ≈øorer vpon the high &amp; ≈øtately oakes, then on the low and ≈øupple willow trees: and the highe≈øt bench is ≈øliddrie≈øt to ≈øit vpon. Neither is it euer heard that any king forgets him≈øelfe towards God, or in his vocation; but God with the greatne≈ø≈øe of the plague reuengeth the greatnes of his ingratitude: Neither thinke I by the force and argument
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:23110:127"/>of this my di≈øcour≈øe ≈øo to per≈øwade the people, that none will hereafter be rai≈øed vp, and rebell again≈øt wicked Princes. But remitting to the iu≈øtice and prouidence of God to ≈øtirre vp ≈øuch ≈øcourges as plea≈øeth him, for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment of wicked kings (who made the very vermine and filthy du≈øt of the earth to bridle the in≈øolencie of proud <hi>Pharaoh</hi>) my onely purpo≈øe and intention in this treati≈øe is to per≈øwade, as farre as lieth in me, by the≈øe ≈øure and infallible grounds, all ≈øuch good Chri≈øtian readers, as beare not onely the naked name of a Chri≈øtian, but kith the fruites thereof in their daily forme of life, to keepe their hearts and hands free from ≈øuch mon≈øtrous and vnnaturall rebellions, when≈øoeuer the wickedne≈ø≈øe of a Prince ≈øhall procure the ≈øame at Gods hands: that, when it ≈øhall plea≈øe God to ca≈øt ≈øuch ≈øcourges of princes, and in≈øtruments of his fury in the fire, ye may ≈øtand vp with cleane handes, and vn≈øpotted con≈øciences, hauing prooued your ≈øelues in all your actions trew Chri≈øtians toward God, and dutifull ≈øubiects towards your King, hauing remitted the iudgement and puni≈øhment of all his wrongs to him, whom to onely of right it appertaineth.</p>
               <p>But crauing at God, and hoping that God ≈øhall continue his ble≈ø≈øing with vs, in not ≈øending ≈øuch fearefull de≈øolation, I heartily wi≈øh our kings behauiour ≈øo to be, and continue among vs, as our God in earth, and louing Father, endued with ≈øuch properties as I de≈øcribed a King in the fir≈øt part of this Treati≈øe.

               <p>With the report of a great di≈øcouery for a Conque≈øt, ≈øome two or three Sauage men, were brought in, together with this Sauage cu≈øtome. But the pitie is, the poore wilde barbarous men died, but that vile barbarous cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtome is yet aliue, yea in fre≈øh vigor: ≈øo as it ≈øeemes a miracle to me, how a cu≈øtome ≈øpringing from ≈øo vile a ground, and brought in by a father ≈øo generally hated, ≈øhould be welcomed vpon ≈øo ≈ølender a warrant. For if they that fir≈øt put it in practi≈øe here, had remembred for what re≈øpect it was v≈øed by them from whence it came, I am ≈øure they would haue bene loath, to haue taken ≈øo farre the imputation of that di≈øea≈øe vpon them as they did, by v≈øing the cure thereof: For <hi>Sanis non e≈øt opus medico,</hi> and counterpoi≈øons are neuer v≈øed, but where poi≈øon is thought to precede.</p>
               <p>But ≈øince it is trew, that diuers cu≈øtomes ≈ølightly grounded, and with no better warrant entred in a Common-wealth, may yet in the v≈øe of them thereafter, prooue both nece≈ø≈øary and profitable; it is therefore next to bee examined, if there be not a full Sympathie and true Proportion, betweene the ba≈øe ground and fooli≈øh entrie, and the loath≈øome and hurtfull v≈øe of this ≈øtinking Antidote.</p>
               <p>I am now therefore heartily to pray you to con≈øider, fir≈øt vpon what fal≈øe and erroneous grounds you haue fir≈øt built the generall good liking thereof; and next, what ≈øinnes towards God, and fooli≈øh vanities before the world you commit, in the dete≈øtable v≈øe of it.</p>
               <p>As for the≈øe deceitfull grounds, that haue ≈øpecially moued you to take a good and great conceit thereof, I ≈øhall content my ≈øelfe to examine here onely foure of the principals of them; two founded vpon the Theoricke of a deceiueable apparance of rea≈øon, and two of them vpon the mi≈øtaken practicke of generall experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:23110:130"/>Fir≈øt, it is thought by you a ≈øure Aphori≈øme in the Phy≈øickes, That the braines of all men, beeing naturally cold and wet, all drie and hote things ≈øhould be good for them; of which nature this ≈øtinking ≈øuffumigation is, and therefore of good v≈øe to them. Of this argument, both the propo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a≈ø≈øumption are fal≈øe, and ≈øo the conclu≈øion cannot but be voyd of it ≈øelfe. For as to the Propo≈øition, That becau≈øe the braines are colde and moi≈øt, therefore things that are hote and dry are be≈øt for them, it is an inept con≈øequence: For man beeing compounded of the foure Complexions, (who≈øe fathers are the foure Elements) although there be a mixture of them all in all the parts of his body, yet mu≈øt the diuers parts of our <hi>Microco≈øme</hi> or little world within our ≈øelues, be diuer≈øly more inclined, ≈øome to one, ≈øome to another complexion, according to the diuer≈øitie of their v≈øes, that of the≈øe di≈øcords a perfect harmonie may be made vp for the maintenance of the whole body.</p>
               <p>The application then of a thing of a contrary nature, to any of the≈øe parts, is to interrupt them of their due function, and by con≈øequence hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the health of the whole bodie. As if a man, becau≈øe the Liuer is hote (as the fountaine of blood) and as it were an ouen to the ≈øtomacke, would therefore apply and weare clo≈øe vpon his Liuer and ≈øtomacke a cake of lead; he might within a very ≈øhort time (I hope) bee ≈øu≈øteined very good cheape at an Ordinarie, be≈øide the clearing of his con≈øcience from that deadly ≈øinne of gluttonie. And as if, becau≈øe the Heart is full of vitall ≈øpirits, and in perpetuall motion, a man would therefore lay a heauie pound ≈øtone on his brea≈øt, for ≈øtaying and holding downe that wanton palpitation, I doubt not but his brea≈øt would be more brui≈øed with the weight therof, then the heart would be comforted with ≈øuch a di≈øagreeable and contrarious cure. And euen ≈øo is it with the braines: For if a man, becau≈øe the braines are cold and humide, would therefore v≈øe inwardly by ≈ømells, or outwardly by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, things of hot and dry qualitie, all the gaine that he could make thereof would onely be to put him≈øelfe in a great forwardnes for running mad, by ouerwatching him≈øelfe, the coldne≈ø≈øe and moi≈øtne≈ø≈øe of our braine being the onely ordinary meanes that procure our ≈øleepe and re≈øt. Indeed I doe not deny, but when it falls out that any of the≈øe, or any part of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die growes to be di≈øtempered, and to tend to an extremitie, beyond the compa≈ø≈øe of Natures temperate mixture, that in that ca≈øe cures of contrary qualities, to the intemperate inclination of that part, being wi≈øely prepared and di≈øcreetly mini≈øtred, may be both nece≈ø≈øary and helpfull for ≈øtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and a≈ø≈øi≈øting Nature in the expul≈øion of her enemies: for this is the trew definition of all profitable Phi≈øicke.</p>
               <p>But fir≈øt the≈øe Cures ought not to be v≈øed, but where there is need of them, the contrary whereof, is daily practi≈øed in this generall v≈øe of <hi>Tobacco</hi> by all ≈øorts and complexions of people.</p>
               <p>And next, I denie the Minor of this argument, as I haue already ≈øaid, in regard that this <hi>Tobacco,</hi> is not ≈øimply of a dry and hote qualitie; but rather
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:23110:130"/>hath a certain venemous facultie ioyned with the heat therof, which makes it haue an Antipathy again≈øt nature, as by the hateful ≈ømel therof doth well appeare. For the no≈øe being the proper Organ and conuoy of the ≈øen≈øe of ≈ømelling to the braines, which are the only fountaine of that ≈øen≈øe, doth euer ≈øerue vs for an infallible witne≈ø≈øe, whether that odour which we ≈ømell, be healthfull or hurtfull to the braine, (except when it fals out that the ≈øen≈øeit ≈øelfe is corrupted and abu≈øed through ≈øome infirmitie, and di≈øtemper in the braine.) And that the ≈øuffumigation thereof cannot haue a drying quality, it needs no further probation, then that it is a ≈ømoke, all ≈ømoke and vapour, being of it ≈øelfe humide, as drawing neere to the nature of the aire, and ea≈øie to be re≈øolued againe into water, whereof there needs no other proofe but the Meteors, which being bred of nothing el≈øe but of the vapors and exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations ≈øucked vp by the Sun out of the earth, the ≈øea, and waters, yet are the ≈øame ≈ømoakie vapors turned and transformed into raines, ≈ønowes, deawes, hoare fro≈øts, and ≈øuch like waterie Meteors, as by the contrary the rainie cloudes are often transformed and euaporated in blu≈øtering windes.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond Argument grounded on a ≈øhew of rea≈øon is, That this filthy ≈ømoake, a≈øwell through the heat and ≈øtrength thereof, as by a naturall force and quality, is able and fit to purge both the head and ≈øtomack of rhewmes and di≈øtillations, as experience teacheth, by the ≈øpitting &amp; auoiding fleame, immediatly after the taking of it. But the fallacie of this Argument may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øily appeare, by my late preceding de≈øcription of the Meteors. For euen as the ≈ømoakie vapours ≈øucked vp by the Sunne, and ≈øtayed in the lowe≈øt and cold Region of the aire, are there contracted into clouds, and turned into raine and ≈øuch other watery Meteors: So this ≈øtinking ≈ømoake being ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp by the no≈øe, &amp; impri≈øoned in the cold and moy≈øt braines, is by their cold and wet facultie, turned and ca≈øt forth againe in waterie di≈øtillations, and ≈øo are you made free and purged of nothing, but that wherewith you wilfully burdened your ≈øelues: and therefore are you no wi≈øer in taking <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco</hi> for purging you of di≈øtillations, then if for preuenting the Cholicke you would take all kind of windie meats and drinkes; and for preuenting of the Stone, you would take all kinde of meates and drinkes that would breed grauell in the kidneys, and then when you were forced to auoide much winde out of your ≈øtomacke, and much grauell in your Vrine, that you ≈øhould attribute the thanke therof to ≈øuch nouri≈øhments, as bred tho≈øe within you, that behooued either to be expelled by the force of Nature, or you to haue <hi>bur≈øt at the broad ≈øide,</hi> as the Prouerbe is.</p>
               <p>As for the other two rea≈øons founded vpon experience, the fir≈øt of which is, That the whole people would not haue taken ≈øo generall a good liking thereof, if they had not by experience found it very ≈øoueraigne and good for them: For an≈øwere thereunto, how ea≈øily the mindes of any people, wherewith God hath repleni≈øhed this world may be drawen to the fooli≈øh affectation of any noueltie, I leaue it to the di≈øcreet iudgement of any man that is rea≈øonable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:23110:131"/>Doe we not daily ≈øee, that a man can no ≈øooner bring ouer from beyond the ≈øeas any new forme of apparell, but that he cannot be thought a man of ≈øpirit, that would not pre≈øently imitate the ≈øame? And ≈øo from hand to hand it ≈øpreads, till it be practi≈øed by all, not for any commodity that is in it, but only becau≈øe it is come to be the fa≈øhion. For ≈øuch is the force of that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ≈øelfe-loue in euery one of vs, and ≈øuch is the corruption of enuy bred in the bre≈øt of euery one, as we cannot be content vnle≈ø≈øe wee imitate euery thing that our fellowes doe, and ≈øo prooue our ≈øelues capable of euery thing whereof they are capable, like Apes, counterfeiting the maners of others, to our owne de≈øtruction. For let one or two of the greate≈øt Ma≈øters of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks in any of the two famous Vniuer≈øities, but con≈øtantly affirme any cleare day, that they ≈øee≈øome ≈øtrange apparition in the skies; they wil I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you be ≈øeconded by the greate≈øt part of the ≈øtudents in that profe≈ø≈øion: So loth will they be, to be thought inferior to their fellowes, either in depth of knowledge or ≈øharpnes of ≈øight: And therfore the generall good liking and imbracing of this fooli≈øh cu≈øtome, doth but only proceed from that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of noueltie, and popular errour, whereof I haue already ≈øpoken.</p>
               <p>The other argument drawn from a mi≈øtaken experience, is but the more particular probation of this generall, becau≈øe it is alledged to be found trew by proofe, that by the taking of <hi>Tobacco</hi> diuers and very many doe finde them≈øelues cured of diuers di≈øea≈øes; as on the other part, no man euer recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued harme thereby. In this argument there is fir≈øt a great mi≈øtaking, and next a mon≈øtrous ab≈øurditie: For is it not a very great mi≈øtaking, to take <hi>non cau≈øam pro cau≈øa,</hi> as they ≈øay in the Logickes? becau≈øe peraduenture when a ≈øicke man hath had his di≈øea≈øe at the height, hee hath at that in≈øtant taken <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and afterward his di≈øea≈øe taking the naturall cour≈øe of declining, and con≈øequently the Patient of recouering his health, O then the <hi>Tobacco</hi> for≈øooth, was the worker of that miracle. Be≈øide that, it is a thing wel known to all Phy≈øicians, that the apprehen≈øion and conceit of the patient, hath by wakening and vniting the vitall ≈øpirits, and ≈øo ≈øtrengthening nature, a great power and vertue to cure diuers di≈øea≈øes. For an euident proofe of mi≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the like ca≈øe, I pray you what fooli≈øh boy, what ≈øilly wench, what olde doting wife, or ignorant countrey clowne, is not a Phy≈øician for the toothach, for the cholicke, and diuers ≈øuch common di≈øea≈øes? Yea, will not euery man you meet withall, teach you a ≈øundry curefor the ≈øame, &amp; ≈øweare by that meane either him≈øelfe, or ≈øome of his neere≈øt kin≈øemen and friends was cured? And yet I hope no man is ≈øo fooli≈øh as to beleeue them. And all the≈øe toyes do only proceed fro the mi≈øtaking <hi>Non cau≈øam pro cau≈øa,</hi> as I haue already ≈øaid, and ≈øo if a man chance to recouer one of any di≈øea≈øe, after hee hath taken <hi>Tobacco,</hi> that mu≈øt haue the thanks of all. But by the contrary, if a man ≈ømoke him≈øelfe to death with it (and many haue done) O then ≈øome other di≈øea≈øe mu≈øt beare the blame for that fault. So doe old harlots thanke their harlotrie for their many yeeres, that cu≈øtome being healthfull (≈øay they) <hi>ad purgandos Renes,</hi> but neuer haue mind how many die of the Pockes
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:23110:131"/>in the flower of their youth. And ≈øo doe olde drunkards thinke they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long their dayes, by their ≈øwinelike diet, but neuer remember how many die drowned in drinke before they be halfe olde.</p>
               <p>And what greater ab≈øurditie can therebe, then to ≈øay that one cure ≈øhall ≈øerue for diuers, nay, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>trarious ≈øorts of di≈øea≈øes? It is an vndoubted ground among all Phy≈øicians, that there is almo≈øt no ≈øort either of nouri≈øhment or medicine, that hath not ≈øome thing in it di≈øagreeable to ≈øome part of mans bodie, becau≈øe as I haue alreadie ≈øaid, the nature of the temperature of euery part, is ≈øo different from another, that according to the olde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, That which is good for the head, is euill for the necke and the ≈øhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: For euen as a ≈øtrong enemy, that inuades a town or fortre≈ø≈øe, although in his ≈øiege thereof, he do belay and compa≈ø≈øe it round about, yet he makes his breach and entry, at ≈øome one or fewe ≈øpeciall parts thereof, which hee hath tried and found to be weake≈øt and lea≈øt able to re≈øi≈øt; ≈øo ≈øickenes doth make her particular a≈ø≈øault, vpon ≈øuch part or parts of our body, as are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke≈øt and ea≈øie≈øt to be ouercome by that ≈øort of di≈øea≈øe, which then doth a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaile vs, although all the re≈øt of the body by Sympathie feele it ≈øelfe to be as it were belayed, and be≈øieged by the affliction of that ≈øpeciall part, the griefe and ≈ømart thereof being by the ≈øen≈øe of feeling di≈øper≈øed through all the re≈øt of our members. And therefore the skilfull Phy≈øician pre≈ø≈øes by ≈øuch cures to purge and ≈øtrengthen that part which is afflicted, as are only fit for that ≈øort of di≈øea≈øe, and doe be≈øt agree with the nature of that infirme part; which being abu≈øed to a di≈øea≈øe of another nature, would proue as hurtfull for the one, as helpfull for the other. Yea, not onely will a skilfull and wary Phy≈øician becarefull to v≈øe no cure but that which is fit for that ≈øort of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe, but he will al≈øo con≈øider all other circum≈øtances, &amp; make the remedies ≈øutable therunto; as the temperature of the clime where the Patient is, the con≈øtitution of the Planets, the time of the Moone, the ≈øea≈øon of the yeere, the aage and complexion of the Patient, and the pre≈øent ≈øtate of his body, in ≈øtrength or weaknes: For one cure mu≈øt not euer be v≈øed for the ≈øelfe≈øame di≈øea≈øe, but according to the varying of any of the fore≈øaid circum≈øtances, that ≈øort of remedy mu≈øt be v≈øed which is fitte≈øt for the ≈øame. Where by the contrary in this ca≈øe, ≈øuch is the miraculous omnipotencie of our ≈øtrong ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted <hi>Tobacco,</hi> as it cures al ≈øorts of di≈øea≈øes (which neuer any drugge could do before) in all per≈øons, and at all times. It cures all maner of di≈øtillations, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the head or ≈øtomacke (if you beleeue their Axiomes) although in very deed it doe both corrupt the braine, and by cau≈øing ouer quicke dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion, fill the ≈øtomacke full of crudities. It cures the gowt in the feet, and (which is miraculous) in that very in≈øtant when the ≈ømoke thereof, as light, flies vp into the head, the vertue therof, as heauy, runs down to the litle toe. It helps all ≈øorts of agues. It makes a man ≈øober that was drunk. It refre≈øhes a weary man, and yet makes a man hungry. Being taken when they goe to bed, it makes one ≈øleepe ≈øoundly, and yet being taken when a man is ≈øleepie and drow≈øie, it will, as they ≈øay, awake his braine, and quicken his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:23110:132"/>As for curing of the Pockes, it ≈øerues for that v≈øe but among the pockie Indian ≈ølaues. Here in <hi>England</hi> it is refined, and will not deigne to cure here any other then cleanly and gentlemanly di≈øea≈øes. O omnipotent power of <hi>Tobacco!</hi> And if it could by the ≈ømoake thereof cha≈øe out deuils, as the ≈ømoake of <hi>Tobias</hi> fi≈øh did (which I am ≈øure could ≈ømell no ≈øtronglier) it would ≈øerue for a precious Relicke, both for the ≈øuper≈øtitious Prie≈øts, and the in≈øolent Puritanes, to ca≈øt out deuils withall.</p>
               <p>Admitting then, and not confe≈ø≈øing, that the v≈øe thereof were healthful for ≈øome ≈øorts of di≈øea≈øes; ≈øhould it be v≈øed for all ≈øickne≈ø≈øes? ≈øhould it be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed by all men? ≈øhould it be v≈øed at all times? yea ≈øhould it be v≈øed by able, yong, ≈øtrong, healthful men? Medicine hath that vertue, that it neuer leaues a man in that ≈øtate wherein it finds him: it makes a ≈øicke man whole, but a whole man ≈øicke: And as Medicine helps nature being taken at times of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øitie, ≈øo being euer and continually v≈øed, it doeth but weaken, weary, and weare nature. What ≈øpeake I of Medicine? Nay let a man euery houre of the day, or as oft as many in this countrey v≈øe to take <hi>Tobacco,</hi> let a man I ≈øay, but take as oft the be≈øt ≈øorts of nouri≈øhments in meate and drinke that can be deui≈øed, he ≈øhall with the continuall v≈øe thereof weaken both his head and his ≈øtomacke: all his members ≈øhall becomefeeble, his ≈øpirits dull, and in the end, as a drow≈øie lazie belly-god, he ≈øhall euani≈øh in a Lethargie.</p>
               <p>And from this weakene≈ø≈øe it proceeds, that many in this kingdome haue had ≈øuch a continuall v≈øe of taking this vn≈øauorie ≈ømoake, as now they are not able to forbeare the ≈øame, no more then an old drunkard can abide to be long ≈øober, without falling into an incurable weakne≈ø≈øe and euill con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for their continuall cu≈øtome hath made to them, <hi>habitum, alteram na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam:</hi> ≈øo to tho≈øe that from their birth haue beene continually nouri≈øhed vpon poi≈øon and things venemous, whol≈øome meats are only poi≈øonable.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing, as I tru≈øt, ≈øufficiently an≈øwered the mo≈øt principall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are v≈øed in defence of this vile cu≈øtome, it re≈øts only to informe you what ≈øinnes and vanities you commit in the filthy abu≈øe thereof. Fir≈øt, are you not guiltie of ≈øinnefull and ≈øhamefull lu≈øt? (for lu≈øt may be as well in any of the ≈øen≈øes as in feeling) that although you be troubled with no di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øe, but in perfect health, yet can you neither be merry at an Ordinary, nor la≈øciuious in the Stewes, if you lacke <hi>Tobacco</hi> to prouoke your appetite to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of tho≈øe ≈øorts of recreation, lu≈øting after it as the children of I≈ørael did in the wilderne≈ø≈øe after Quailes? Secondly it is, as you v≈øe or rather abu≈øe it, a branch of the ≈øinne of drunkennes, which is the root of all ≈øinnes: for as the only delight that drunkards take in wine is in the ≈øtrength of the ta≈øte, and the force of the fume therof that mounts vp to the braine: for no drunkards loue any weake, or ≈øweet drinke: ≈øo are not tho≈øe (I meane the ≈øtrong heate and the fume) the onely qualities that make <hi>Tobacco</hi> ≈øo delectable to all the louers of it? And as no man likes ≈øtrong heady drinke the fir≈øt day (becau≈øe <hi>nemo repent√® fit turpi≈øsimus</hi>) but by cu≈øtome is piece and piece allured, while in the ende, a drunkard will haue as great a thir≈øt to be drunke, as a ≈øober
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:23110:132"/>man to quench his thir≈øt with a draught when he hath need of it: So is not this the very ca≈øe of all the great takers of <hi>Tobacco?</hi> which therefore they them≈øelues doe attribute to a bewitching qualitie in it. Thirdly, is it not the greate≈øt ≈øinne of all, that you the people of all ≈øorts of this kingdome, who are created and ordeined by God, to be≈øtow both your per≈øons and goods, for the maintenance both of the honour and ≈øafety of your King and Common wealth, ≈øhould di≈øable your ≈øelues in both? In your per≈øons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by this continuall vile cu≈øtome brought your ≈øelues to this ≈øhamefull imbecilitie, that you are not able to ride or walke the iourney of a Iewes Sabboth, but you mu≈øt haue a reekie cole brought you from the next poore hou≈øe to kindle your <hi>Tobacco</hi> with? whereas he cannot be thought able for any ≈øeruice in the warres, that cannot endure oftentimes the want of meat, drinke, and ≈øleepe, much more then mu≈øt he endure the want of <hi>Tobacco.</hi> In the times of the many glorious and victorious battailes fought by this Nation, there was no word of <hi>Tobacco:</hi> but now if it were time of warres, and that you were to make ≈øome ≈øudden <hi>Caualcado</hi> vpon your enemies, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you ≈øhould ≈øeeke lei≈øure to ≈øtay behinde his fellow for taking of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,</hi> for my part I ≈øhould neuer be ≈øory for any euill chance that might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him. To take a cu≈øtome in any thing that cannot be left againe, is mo≈øt harmeful to the people of any land. <hi>Mollicies</hi> and delicacie were the wracke and ouerthrow, fir≈øt of the <hi>Per≈øian,</hi> and next of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire. And this very cu≈øtome of taking <hi>Tobacco</hi> (whereof our pre≈øent purpo≈øe is) is euen at this day accounted ≈øo effeminate among the <hi>Indians</hi> them≈øelues, as in the market they will offer no price for a ≈ølaue to be ≈øold, whom they find to be a great <hi>Tobacco</hi> taker.</p>
               <p>Now how you are by this cu≈øtome di≈øabled in your goods, let the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of this land beare witne≈ø≈øe, ≈øome of them be≈øtowing three, ≈øome foure hundred pounds a yeere vpon this precious ≈øtinke, which I am ≈øure might be be≈øtowed vpon many farre better v≈øes. I read indeed of a knaui≈øh Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, who for abu≈øing the fauour of the Emperor <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, by taking bribes to intercede, for ≈øundry per≈øons in his ma≈øters eare, (for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> he neuer once opened his mouth) was iu≈øtly choked with ≈ømoke, with this doome, <hi>Fumo pereat, qui fumum vendidit:</hi> but of ≈øo many ≈ømoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buyers, as are at this pre≈øent in this kingdome, I neuer read nor heard.</p>
               <p>And for the vanities committed in this filthy cu≈øtome, is it not both great vanitie and vncleanne≈ø≈øe, that at the table, a place of re≈øpect, of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈ø≈øe, of mode≈øtie, men ≈øhould not be a≈øhamed, to ≈øit to≈ø≈øing of <hi>Tobacco pipes,</hi> and puffing of the ≈ømoke of <hi>Tobacco</hi> one to another, making the filthy ≈ømoke and ≈øtinke thereof, to exhale athwart the di≈øhes, and infect the aire, when very often, men that abhorre it are at their repa≈øt? Surely ≈ømoke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a kitchin farre better then a dining chamber, and yet it makes a kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin al≈øo oftentimes in the inward parts of men, ≈øoyling and infecting them, with an vnctuous and oily kind of ≈øoote, as hath bene found in ≈øome great <hi>Tobacco</hi> takers, that after their death were opened. And not onely
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:23110:133"/>meat time, but no other time nor action is exempted from the publike v≈øe of this vnciuill tricke: ≈øo as if the wiues of <hi>Diepe</hi> li≈øt to conte≈øt with this Nation for good maners, their wor≈øt maners would in all rea≈øon be found at lea≈øt not ≈øo di≈øhone≈øt (as ours are) in this point.

And is it not a great vanitie, that a man cannot heartily welcome his friend now, but ≈øtraight they mu≈øt be in hand with <hi>Tobacco:</hi> No it is become in place of a eure, a point of good fellow≈øhip, and hee that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øe to take a pipe of <hi>Tobacco</hi> among his fellowes, (though by his owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection hee would rather feele the ≈øauour of a Sinke) is accounted peeui≈øh and no good company, euen as they doe with tipling in the colde Ea≈øterne countreys. Yea the Mi≈øtre≈ø≈øe cannot in a more manerly kind, entertaine her ≈øeruant, then by giuing him out of her faire hand a pipe of <hi>Tobacco.</hi> But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is not only a great vanity, but a great contempt of Gods good giftes, that the ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe of mans breath, being a good gift of God, ≈øhould be wilfully corrupted by this ≈øtinking ≈ømoke, wherin I mu≈øt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fe≈ø≈øe, it hath too ≈øtrong a vertue; and ≈øo that which is an ornament of nature, &amp; can neither by any artifice be at the fir≈øt acquired, nor once lo≈øt be recouered againe, ≈øhalbe fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily corrupted with an incurable ≈øtinke, which vile qualitie is as directly contrary to that wrong opinion which is holden of the whole≈øomne≈ø≈øe therof, as the venime of putrifaction is contrary to the vertue Pre≈øeruatiue.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, which is a great iniquitie, and again≈øt all humanitie, the hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ≈øhal not be a≈øhamed, to reduce therby his delicate, whol≈øom, &amp; cleane complexioned wife to that extremity, that either ≈øhe mu≈øt al≈øo corrupt her ≈øweet breath therwith, or els re≈øolue to liue in a perpetual ≈øtinking torment.</p>
               <p>Haue you not rea≈øon then to be a≈øhamed, and to forbeare this filthie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie, ≈øo ba≈øely grounded, ≈øo fooli≈øhly receiued, and ≈øo gro≈ø≈øely mi≈øtaken in the right v≈øe thereof?

            <p>
               <hi>MY Lord, Out of the loue I beare to ≈øome of your friends, I haue a care of your pre≈øeruation. Therefore I would adui≈øe you, as you tender your life, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui≈øe ≈øome excu≈øe to ≈øhift off your attendance at this Parliament. For God and man haue concurred to puni≈øh the wickedne≈ø≈øe of this Time. And thinke not ≈ølightly of this Aduerti≈øement, but retire your ≈øelfe into your Countrey, where you may expect the euent in ≈øafety. For though there be no apparance of any ≈øtirre, yet I ≈øay, they ≈øhal receiue a terrible Blow this Parliament, and yet they ≈øhall not ≈øee who burts them. This coun≈øell is not to be contemned, becau≈øe it may doe you good, and can doe you no harme; for the danger is past ≈øo ≈øoone as you haue burnt the Letter. And I hope God will giue you the grace to make good v≈øe of it: To who≈øe holy protection I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you.</hi>

            <p>The King no ≈øooner read the Letter, but after a little pau≈øe,
<note place="margin">His Maie≈øties iudgement of the Letter.</note> and then reading it ouer againe, he deliuered his iudgement of it in ≈øuch ≈øort, as hee thought it was not to be contemned, for that the Style of it ≈øeemed to bee more quicke and pithie, then is v≈øuall to be in any Pa≈øquil or libel (the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities of idle braines:) But the Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi> perceiuing the King to apprehend it deepelier then he looked for, knowing his nature, told him that he thought by one ≈øentence in it, that it was like to be written by ≈øome foole or madman, reading to him this ≈øentence in it, <hi>For the danger is past as ≈øoone as you haue burnt the Letter;</hi> which hee ≈øaid, was likely to bee the ≈øaying of a foole: for if the danger was pa≈øt ≈øo ≈øoone as the Letter was burnt, then the warning behooued to bee of little auayle, when the burning of the Letter might make the danger to be e≈øchewed.

            <p>This could not but encrea≈øe the Kings former apprehen≈øion and iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øie: whereupon hee in≈øi≈øted (as before) that the Hou≈øe was narrowly to bee ≈øearched, and that tho≈øe Billets and Coales would be ≈øearched to the bottome, it beeing mo≈øt ≈øu≈øpicious that they were layed there onely for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering of the powder.

And yet vpon the other part they were all extreme loath and daintie, that in ca≈øe this Letter ≈øhould proue to bee nothing but the euaporation of an idle braine; then a curious ≈øearch beeing made, and nothing found, ≈øhould not onely turne to the generall ≈øcandall of the King and the State, as being ≈øo ≈øu≈øpicious of euery light and friuolous toy, but likewi≈øe lay an ill fauoured imputation vpon the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> one of his Maie≈øties greate≈øt Subiects and Coun≈øailors, this <hi>Tho.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was at la≈øt concluded, That nothing ≈øhould bee left vn≈øearched in tho≈øe Hou≈øes: And yet for the better colour and ≈øtay of rumour, in ca≈øe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were found, it was thought meet, that vpon a pretence of <hi>Whyneards</hi> mi≈ø≈øing ≈øome of the Kings ≈øtuffe or Hangings which he had in keeping, all tho≈øe roumes ≈øhould be narrowly ripped for them. And to this purpo≈øe was Sir <hi>Thomas Kneuet</hi> (a Gentleman of his Maie≈øties priuie Chamber) em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, being a Iu≈øtice of Peace in <hi>Westminster,</hi> and one, of who≈øe ancient fidelitie both the late Queene and our now Soueraigne haue had large proofe: who according to the tru≈øt committed vnto him, went about the midnight next after, to the Parliament-hou≈øe, accompanied with ≈øuch a ≈ømall number as was fit for that errand.

<note place="margin">

            <p>Thus after Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> had cau≈øed the wretch to bee ≈øurely bound, and well guarded by the company hee had brought with him, hee him≈øelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe to the Kings Palace, and gaue warning of his ≈øucce≈ø≈øe to the Lord Chamberlaine, and Earle of Salisburie, who immediatly warning the re≈øt of the Councell that lay in the hou≈øe, as ≈øoone as they could get them≈øelues ready, came, with their fellow Coun≈øellers, to the Kings Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, being at that time neere foure of the clocke in the morning.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot out of hope to obtaine pardon: for, ≈øpeaking of my temporall part, I may ≈øay, The fault is greater then can bee forgiuen; nor affecting hereby the title of a good Subiect; for I mu≈øt redeeme my countrey from as great a danger, as I haue hazarded the bringing of her into, before I can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øe any ≈øuch opinion, Onely at your Honours command I will briefly ≈øet downe mine owne accu≈øation, and how farre I haue proceeded in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe; which I ≈øhall the faithfullier doe, ≈øince I ≈øee ≈øuch cour≈øes are not plea≈øing to Almightie God, and that all, or the mo≈øt materiall parts haue bene already confe≈ø≈øed.</p>
                        <p>I remained with my brother in the countrey, from Alhallontyde vntill the beginning of Lent, in the yeere of our Lord 1603. the fir≈øt yeere of the Kings reigne: about which time ma≈øter <hi>Catesby</hi> ≈øent thither, intreating me to come to London, where hee and other my friends would be glad to ≈øee me. I de≈øired him to excu≈øe me: for I found my ≈øelfe not very well di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed; and (which had happened neuer to mee before) returned the me≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger without my company. Shortly I receiued another letter, in any wi≈øe to come. At the ≈øecond ≈øummons I pre≈øently came vp, and found him with ma≈øter <hi>Iohn Wright</hi> at Lambeth, where he brake with me, how nece≈ø≈øary it was not to for≈øake our countrey (for he knew I had then a re≈øolution to goe ouer) but to deliuer her from the ≈øeruitude in which ≈øhee remained, or at lea≈øt to a≈ø≈øi≈øt her with our vttermo≈øt endeuours. I an≈øwered, That I had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hazarded my life vpon farre lighter termes, and now would not refu≈øe any good occa≈øion, wherein I might doe ≈øeruice to the Catholicke cau≈øe; but for my ≈øelfe I knew no meane probable to ≈øucceed. He ≈øaid that he had bethought him of a way at one in≈øtant to deliuer vs from all our bonds, and without any forraine helpe to replant againe the Catholicke Religion; and with all told mee in a word, It was to blow vp the Parliament hou≈øe with Gunpowder; for, ≈øaid he, in that place haue they done vs all the mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, and perchance God hath de≈ø≈øeigned that place for their puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I wondered at the ≈øtrangene≈ø≈øe of the conceipt, and told him that trew it was, this ≈øtrake at the root, and would breed a confu≈øion fit to beget new alterations; But if it ≈øhould not take effect (as mo≈øt of this nature mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caried)
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:23110:139"/>the ≈øcandall would be ≈øo great which Catholicke Religion might hereby ≈øu≈øtaine, as not onely our enemies, but our friends al≈øo would with good rea≈øon condemne vs. He told me, The nature of the di≈øea≈øe required ≈øo ≈øharpe a remedie, and asked me if I would giue my con≈øent. I told him, yes, in this or what els ≈øoeuer; if he re≈øolued vpon it, I would venture my life. But I propo≈øed many difficulties, As want of an hou≈øe, and of one to cary the Myne, noy≈øe in the working, and ≈øuch like. His an≈øwere was, Let vs giue an attempt, and where it faileth, pa≈ø≈øe no further. But fir≈øt, quoth hee, Becau≈øe wee will leaue no peaceable and quiet way vntryed, you ≈øhall goe ouer, and informe the Con≈øtable of the ≈øtate of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes here in England, intreating him to ≈øollicite his Maie≈øtie at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither, that the penall Lawes may be recalled, and wee admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the rancke of his other Subiects; withall, you may bring ouer ≈øome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Gentleman, ≈øuch as you ≈øhall vnder≈øtand be≈øt able for this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and named vnto mee ma≈øter <hi>Fawkes.</hi> Shortly after, I pa≈ø≈øed the Sea, and found the Con≈øtable at <hi>Bergen</hi> neere <hi>Dunkirke,</hi> where, by helpe of ma≈øter <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen</hi> I deliuered my me≈ø≈øage; Who≈øe an≈øwere was, that hee had ≈øtrict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from his Ma≈øter, to doe all good Offices for the Catholickes, and for his owne part hee thought him≈øelfe bound in con≈øcience ≈øo to doe, and that no good occa≈øion ≈øhould be omitted, but ≈øpake to him nothing of this matter.</p>
                        <p>Returning to <hi>Dunkirck</hi> with ma≈øter <hi>Owen,</hi> wee had ≈øpeach whether hee thought the Con≈øtable would faithfully helpe vs, or no. He ≈øaid he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued nothing le≈ø≈øe, and that they ≈øought onely their owne ends, holding ≈ømall account of Catholicks. I told him that there were many Gentlemen in <hi>England,</hi> who would not for≈øake their countrey vntill they had tried the vttermo≈øt, &amp; rather venture their liues, then for≈øake her in this mi≈øerie. And to adde one more to our number, as a fit man both for coun≈øel and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what≈øoeuer we ≈øhould re≈øolue, wi≈øhed for ma≈øter <hi>Fawkes,</hi> whom I had heard good commendations of: hee told mee the Gentleman de≈øerued no le≈ø≈øe, but was at <hi>Bru≈ø≈øels,</hi> and that if he came not, as happily he might, before my departure, he would ≈øend him ≈øhortly after into <hi>England.</hi> I went ≈øoone after to <hi>O≈øtend,</hi> where ≈øir <hi>William Stanley</hi> as then was not, but came two daies after. I remained with him three or foure daies, in which time I asked him, if the Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> ≈øhould do any thing to helpe them≈øelues, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he thought the Archduke would ≈øecond them? He an≈øwered, No, for all tho≈øe parts were ≈øo de≈øirous of peace with <hi>England,</hi> as they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure no ≈øpeach of other enterpri≈øe: neither were it fit, ≈øaid hee, to ≈øet any proiect afoot, now the Peace is vpon concluding. I told him there was no ≈øuch re≈øolution, and ≈øo fell to di≈øcour≈øe of other matters, vntill I came to ≈øpeake of ma≈øter <hi>Fawkes,</hi> who≈øe company I wi≈øhed ouer into <hi>England.</hi> I asked of his ≈øufficiencie in the warres, and told him wee ≈øhould need ≈øuch as hee, if occa≈øion required; hee gaue very good commendations of him. And as wee were thus di≈øcour≈øing, and I ready to depart for <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi>
                           <pb n="236" facs="tcp:23110:140"/>and taking my leaue of Sir <hi>William,</hi> Ma≈øter <hi>Fawkes</hi> came into our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, newly returned, and ≈øaluted vs. This is the Gentleman, ≈øaid Sir <hi>William,</hi> that you wi≈øhed for, and ≈øo we embraced againe. I told him ≈øome good friends of his wi≈øhed his companie in <hi>England,</hi> and that if hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to come to <hi>Dunkircke,</hi> wee would haue further conference, whither I was then going: ≈øo taking my leaue of them both, I departed. About two dayes after came Ma≈øter <hi>Fawkes</hi> to <hi>Dunkirck,</hi> where I told him that we were vpon a re≈øolution to doe ≈øomewhat in <hi>England,</hi> if the Peace with <hi>Spaine</hi> helped vs not, but had as yet re≈øolued vpon nothing; ≈øuch or the like talke wee pa≈ø≈øed at <hi>Graueling,</hi> where I lay for a winde, and when it ≈øerued came both in one Pa≈ø≈øage to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> neere which place wee tooke a paire of Oares, and ≈øo came vp to <hi>London,</hi> and came to Ma≈øter <hi>Catesby</hi> whom wee found in his lodging; hee welcommed vs into <hi>England,</hi> and asked mee what newes from the Con≈øtable. I told him, good words, but I feared the deedes would not an≈øwere: This was the beginning of Ea≈øter Terme, and about the midde≈øt of the ≈øame Terme, (whether ≈øent for by Ma≈øter <hi>Catesby,</hi> or vpon ≈øome bu≈øine≈ø≈øe of his owne) vp came Ma≈øter <hi>Thomas Percy.</hi> The fir≈øt word hee ≈øpake (after hee came into our company) was, Shall we alwayes (Gentlemen) talke, and neuer doe any thing? Ma≈øter <hi>Catesby</hi> took him a≈øide, and had ≈øpeach about ≈øomewhat to be done, ≈øo as fir≈øt we might all take an oath of ≈øecrecie, which wee re≈øolued within two or three dayes to doe: ≈øo as there we met behind <hi>S. Clements,</hi> Ma≈øter <hi>Catesby,</hi> Ma≈øter <hi>Percy,</hi> Ma≈øter <hi>Wright,</hi> Ma≈øter <hi>Guy Fawkes,</hi> and my ≈øelfe; and hauing vpon a Primer giuen each other the oath of ≈øecrecie, in a chamber where no other bodie was, wee went after into the next roome and heard Ma≈ø≈øe, and receiued the ble≈ø≈øed Sacrament vpon the ≈øame. Then did Ma≈øter <hi>Catesby</hi> di≈øclo≈øe to Ma≈øter <hi>Percy,</hi> and I together with <hi>Iacke Wright,</hi> tell to Ma≈øter <hi>Fawkes</hi> the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe for which wee tooke this oath, which they both approued. And then was M. <hi>Percy</hi> ≈øent to take the hou≈øe, which M. <hi>Catesby</hi> in mine ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, had learned did belong to one <hi>Ferris,</hi> which with ≈øome difficultie in the end he obtained, and became, as <hi>Ferris</hi> before was, Tenant to <hi>Whynniard.</hi> M. <hi>Fawkes</hi> vnderwent the name of M. <hi>Percies</hi> man, calling him≈øelfe <hi>Iohn≈øon,</hi> becau≈øe his face was the mo≈øt vnknowen, and receiued the keyes of the hou≈øe, vntill wee heard that the Parliament was adiourned to the ≈øeuenth of Februarie: At which time we all departed ≈øeuerall wayes into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to meete againe at the beginning of Michaelmas Terme. Before this time al≈øo it was thought conuenient to haue a hou≈øe that might an≈øwere to M. <hi>Percies,</hi> where we might make proui≈øion of powder and wood for the Mine, which beeing there made ready, ≈øhould in a night be conueyed by boate to the hou≈øe by the Parliament, becau≈øe wee were loath to foile that with often going in and out. There was none that we could deui≈øe ≈øo fit as <hi>Lambeth,</hi> where Ma≈øter <hi>Catesby</hi> often lay, and to bee keeper thereof (by M. <hi>Catesbies</hi> choice) we receiued into the number, <hi>Keyes,</hi> as a tru≈øtie hone≈øt man: this was about a moneth before Michaelmas.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="237" facs="tcp:23110:140"/>Some fortnight after towards the beginning of the Terme, M. <hi>Fawkes</hi> and I came to M. <hi>Catesby</hi> at <hi>Morecrofts,</hi> where we agreed that now was time to beginne and ≈øet things in order for the Mine. So as Ma≈øter <hi>Fawkes</hi> went to <hi>London,</hi> and the next day ≈øent for me to come ouer to him: when I came, the cau≈øe was, for that the Scotti≈øh Lords were appointed to ≈øit in conference of the Vnion in Ma≈øter <hi>Percies</hi> hou≈øe. This hindered our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning vntill a fortnight before Chri≈øtmas, by which time both Ma≈øter <hi>Percie</hi> and Ma≈øter <hi>Wright</hi> were come to <hi>London,</hi> and wee again≈øt their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming had prouided a good part of the powder: ≈øo as wee all fiue entred with tooles fit to beginne our worke, hauing prouided our ≈øelues of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked-meates, the le≈ø≈øe to need ≈øending abroad. We entred late in the night, and were neuer ≈øeene ≈øaue onely Ma≈øter <hi>Percies</hi> man, vntill Chri≈øtmas Eue, In which time we wrought vnder a little Entry to the wall of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hou≈øe, and vnderpropped it, as we went, with wood.</p>
                        <p>While≈øt we were together, we began to fa≈øhion our bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øed what we ≈øhould doe after this deed was done. The fir≈øt que≈øtion was how we might ≈øurprize the next heire, the Prince haply would bee at the Parliament with the King his Father, how ≈øhould wee then bee able to ≈øeaze on the Duke? This burthen Ma≈øter <hi>Percie</hi> vndertooke, that by his acquaintance, hee, with another Gentleman would enter the Chamber without ≈øu≈øpition, and hauing ≈øome doozen others at ≈øeuerall doores to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his comming, and two or three on hor≈øebacke at the Court gate to receiue him, hee would vndertake (the blow beeing giuen, vntill which hee would attend in the Dukes Chamber) to carrie him ≈øafe away: for hee ≈øuppo≈øed mo≈øt of the Court would bee ab≈øent, and ≈øuch as were there not ≈øu≈øpecting, or vnprouided for any ≈øuch matter. For the Lady ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH, it were ea≈øie to ≈øurprize her in the Countrey, by drawing friends together at an hunting neere the Lord <hi>Haringtons,</hi> and A≈øhbie, M. <hi>Catesbies</hi> hou≈øe, being not farre off was a fit place for preparation.</p>
                        <p>The next was for money and hor≈øes, which if wee could prouide in any rea≈øonable mea≈øure (hauing the Heire apparant) and the fir≈øt knowledge by foure or fiue dayes, was oddes ≈øufficient.</p>
                        <p>Then what Lords we ≈øhould ≈øaue from the Parliament, which was fir≈øt agreed in generall as many as we could that were Catholickes, or ≈øo di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed: but after we de≈øcended to ≈øpeake of particulars.</p>
                        <p>Next, what forraine Princes wee ≈øhould acquaint with this before, or ioyne with after. For this point wee agreed, that fir≈øt wee could not enioyne Princes to that ≈øecrecie, nor oblige them by oath, ≈øo to be ≈øecure of their promi≈øe: be≈øides, we knew not whether they will approue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect or di≈ølike it: And if they doe allow thereof, to prepare before, might beget ≈øu≈øpition, and not to prouide vntill the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe were acted, the ≈øame letter that caried newes of the thing done, might as well intreate their helpe and furtherance. <hi>Spaine</hi> is too ≈ølow in his preparations to hope any good from in the fir≈øt extremities, and <hi>France</hi> too neere and too dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:23110:141"/>who with the ≈øhipping of <hi>Holland,</hi> we feared of all the world might make away with vs.</p>
                        <p>But while we were in the middle of the≈øe di≈øcour≈øes, we heard that the Parliament ≈øhould bee anew adiourned vntill after Michaelmas, vpon which tidings we broke off both di≈øcour≈øe and working vntill after Chri≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas. About Candlemas we brought ouer in a boate the powder, which we had prouided at Lambeth, and laide it in M. <hi>Percies</hi> hou≈øe, becau≈øe wee were willing to haue all our danger in one place.</p>
                        <p>We wrought al≈øo another fortnight in the Mine again≈øt the ≈øtone wall, which was very hard to beate thorow; at which time we called in <hi>Kit Wright,</hi> and neare to Ea≈øter, as we wrought the third time, opportunitie was giuen to hire the Cellar, in which we re≈øolued to lay the powder, and leaue the Mine.</p>
                        <p>Now by rea≈øon that the charge of maintaining vs all ≈øo long together, be≈øides the number of ≈øeuerall hou≈øes, which for ≈øeuerall v≈øes had beene hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and buying of powder &amp;c. had layen heauie on M. <hi>Catesby</hi> alone to ≈øupport; it was nece≈ø≈øarie for him to call in ≈øome others to ea≈øe his charge, and to that ende de≈øired leaue, that hee, with M. <hi>Percy,</hi> and a third, whom they ≈øhould call, might acquaint whom they thought fit and willing to the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe: for many, ≈øaid hee, may be content that I ≈øhould know, who would not therefore that all the company ≈øhould be acquainted with their names: to this we all agreed.</p>
                        <p>After this Ma≈øter <hi>Fawkes</hi> laid into the Cellar (which hee had newly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) a thou≈øand of Billets, and fiue hundred of Faggots, and with that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the Powder, becau≈øe we might haue the Hou≈øe free, to ≈øuffer any one to enter that would. Ma≈øter <hi>Catesby</hi> wi≈øhed vs to con≈øider, whether it were not now nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øend M. <hi>Fawkes</hi> ouer, both to ab≈øent him≈øelfe for a time, as al≈øo to acquaint Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> and M. <hi>Owen</hi> with this matter. Wee agreed that he ≈øhould (prouided that hee gaue it them with the ≈øame othe that wee had taken it before) <hi>videlicet,</hi> to keepe it ≈øecret from all the world. The rea≈øon why we de≈øired Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> ≈øhould be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted herewith was, to haue him with vs ≈øo ≈øoone as he could: And for M. <hi>Owen,</hi> hee might holde good corre≈øpondencie after with forreine Princes. So M. <hi>Fawkes</hi> departed about Ea≈øter for <hi>Flanders,</hi> and returned the latter end of Augu≈øt. He tolde me that when he arriued at <hi>Bru≈ø≈øels,</hi> Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> was not returned from <hi>Spaine,</hi> ≈øo as hee vttered the matter onely to <hi>Owen,</hi> who ≈øeemed well plea≈øed with the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, but tolde him that fure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sir <hi>William</hi> would not be acquainted with any plot, as hauing bu≈øine≈ø≈øe now afoot in the Court of <hi>England;</hi> but he him≈øelfe would be alwayes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to tell it him, and ≈øend him away ≈øo ≈øoone as it were done.</p>
                        <p>About this time did M. <hi>Percy</hi> and M. <hi>Catesby</hi> meete at the <hi>Bathe,</hi> where they agreed that the company being yet but few, M. <hi>Catesby</hi> ≈øhould haue the others authoritie to call in whom hee thought be≈øt; By which autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie hee called in after, Sir <hi>Euerard Digby,</hi> though at what time I know not,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:23110:141"/>and la≈øt of all M. <hi>Francis Tre≈øham.</hi> The fir≈øt promi≈øed, as I heard M. <hi>Catesby</hi> ≈øay, fifteene hundred pounds; the ≈øecond two thou≈øand pounds; M. <hi>Percy</hi> him≈øelfe promi≈øed all that hee could get of the Earle of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> rents, which was about foure thou≈øand pounds, and to prouide many gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping hor≈øes to the number of ten.</p>
                        <p>Meane while M. <hi>Fawkes</hi> and my ≈øelfe alone bought ≈øome new Powder, as ≈øu≈øpecting the fir≈øt to be danke, and conueyed it into the Cellar, and ≈øet it in order, as wee re≈øolued it ≈øhould ≈øtand. Then was the Parliament anew prorogued vntill the fift of Nouember, ≈øo as we all went downe vntil ≈øome ten dayes before, when M. <hi>Catesby</hi> came vp with M. <hi>Fawkes</hi> to an hou≈øe by <hi>Enfield Chace</hi> called <hi>White-webbes,</hi> whither I came to them, and M. <hi>Catesby</hi> willed me to enquire whether the yong Prince came to the Parliament: I tolde him that I heard that his Grace thought not to be there. Then mu≈øt wee haue our Hor≈øes ≈øaid M. <hi>Catesby</hi> beyond the water, and proui≈øion of more company to ≈øurpri≈øe the Prince, and leaue the Duke alone.</p>
                        <p>Two dayes after being Sunday at night, in came one to my chamber, and told me that a letter had beene giuen to my L. <hi>Mountegle</hi> to this effect, That he wi≈øhed his Lord≈øhips ab≈øence from the Parliament, becau≈øe a blow would there be giuen; which letter he pre≈øently caried to my L. of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On the morrow I went to <hi>White-webbes,</hi> and told it M. <hi>Catesby,</hi> a≈ø≈øuring him withall that the matter was di≈øclo≈øed; and wi≈øhing him in any ca≈øe to for≈øake his Countrey. He told me he would ≈øee further as yet, and re≈øolued to ≈øend M. <hi>Fawkes</hi> to trie the vttermo≈øt, prote≈øting if the part belonged to him≈øelfe, he would trie the ≈øame aduenture.</p>
                        <p>On Wedne≈øday Ma≈øter <hi>Fawkes</hi> went and returned at night, of which we were very glad.</p>
                        <p>Thur≈øday I came to London, and Friday Ma≈øter <hi>Catesby,</hi> Ma≈øter <hi>Tre≈øham</hi> and I met at <hi>Barnet,</hi> where wee que≈øtioned how this Letter ≈øhould be ≈øent to my L. <hi>Mountegle,</hi> but could not conceiue, for Ma≈øter <hi>Tre≈øham</hi> for≈øware it, whom we onely ≈øu≈øpected.</p>
                        <p>On Saturday night I met M. <hi>Tre≈øham</hi> againe in Lincolnes Inne walkes: wherein he tolde ≈øuch ≈øpeeches, that my Lord of <hi>Salisbury</hi> ≈øhould v≈øe to the King, as I gaue it lo≈øt the ≈øecond time, and repeated the ≈øame to M. <hi>Catesby,</hi> who hereupon was re≈øolued to be gone, but ≈øtayed to haue M. <hi>Percy</hi> come vp, who≈øe con≈øent herein wee wanted. On Sunday M. <hi>Percy</hi> being dealt with to that end, would needs abide the vttermo≈øt triall.</p>
                        <p>This ≈øu≈øpicion of all hands put vs into ≈øuch confu≈øion, as M. <hi>Catesby</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolued to goe downe into the countrey the Munday that M. <hi>Percy</hi> went to <hi>Syon,</hi> and M. <hi>Percy</hi> re≈øolued to follow the ≈øame night, or early the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. About fiue of the clocke being Tue≈øday, came the yonger <hi>Wright</hi> to my Chamber, and tolde me that a Nobleman called the L. <hi>Mountegle,</hi> ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Ari≈øe, and come along to <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> hou≈øe, for I am going to call vp my L. of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> ≈øaying withall, The matter is di≈øcouered Goe backe M. <hi>Wright</hi> (quoth I) and learne what you can about <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> gate. Shortly hee
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:23110:142"/>returned and ≈øaid, Surely all is lo≈øt: for <hi>Lepton</hi> is got on hor≈øebacke at <hi>E≈øsex</hi> doore, and as he parted, he asked if their Lord≈øhips would haue any more with him: and being an≈øwered No, is rode fa≈øt vp Fleet≈øtreete as hee can ride. Goe you then (quoth I) to M. <hi>Percy,</hi> for ≈øure it is for him they ≈øeeke, and bid him be gone, I will ≈øtay and ≈øee the vttermo≈øt. Then I went to the Court gates, and found them ≈øtraitly guarded, ≈øo as no body could enter. From thence I went downe towards the Parliament hou≈øe, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of Kings-≈øtreet, found the Guard ≈øtanding that would not let me pa≈ø≈øe. And as I returned I heard one ≈øay, There is a Trea≈øon di≈øcouered, in which the King and the Lords ≈øhould haue beene blowen vp. So then I was fully ≈øatisfied that all was knowen, and went to the Stable where my gelding ≈øtood, and rode into the countrey. Ma≈øter <hi>Catesby</hi> had appointed our mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at <hi>Dunchurch,</hi> but I could not ouertake them vntill I came to my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which was Wedne≈øday night. On Thur≈øday wee tooke the Armour at my Lord <hi>Wind≈øores,</hi> and went that night to one <hi>Stephen Littletons</hi> hou≈øe, where the next day (being Friday) as I was early abroad to di≈øcouer, my man came to me, and ≈øaid, that an heauie mi≈øchance had ≈øeuered all the company, for that M. <hi>Catesby,</hi> M. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and M. <hi>Grant,</hi> were burned with Gunpowder vpon which ≈øight the re≈øt di≈øper≈øed. Ma≈øter <hi>Littleton</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed me to flie, and ≈øo would hee. I told him I would fir≈øt ≈øee the body of my friend and bury him, what≈øoeuer befell me. When I came, I found M. <hi>Catesby</hi> rea≈øonable well, Ma≈øter <hi>Percy,</hi> both the <hi>Wrights,</hi> M. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and Ma≈øter <hi>Grant.</hi> I asked them what they re≈øolued to doe: they an≈øwered, We meane here to die. I ≈øaid againe, I would take ≈øuch part as they did. About eleuen of the clocke came the company to be≈øet the hou≈øe, and as I walked into the court, I was ≈øhot into the ≈øhoulder, which lo≈øt me the v≈øe of mine arme: the next ≈øhot was the elder <hi>Wright</hi> ≈øtricken dead, after him the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger M. <hi>Wright,</hi> and fourthly <hi>Ambro≈øe Rookwood</hi> ≈øhot. Then ≈øaid M. <hi>Catesby</hi> to me, (≈øtanding before the doore they were to enter) Stand by me <hi>Tom,</hi> and we will die together. Sir (quoth I) I haue lo≈øt the v≈øe of my right arme, and I feare that will cau≈øe me to be taken. So as wee ≈øtood clo≈øe together, M. <hi>Catesby,</hi> M. <hi>Percy,</hi> and my ≈øelfe, they two were ≈øhot (as farre as I could gue≈ø≈øe with one Bullet) and then the company entred vpon me, hurt me in the Belly with a Pike, and gaue me other wounds, vntill one came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, and caught holde of both mine armes.</p>

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:23110:146"/>being head of the contrary part) can permit no intelligence nor intercour≈øe of me≈ø≈øengers betweene mee and the Pope: yet there being no denounced warre betweene vs, he hath by this action broken the rules of common ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilitie and iu≈øtice betweene Chri≈øtian Princes, in thus condemning me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, both by accounting me a per≈øecutor, which cannot be but implied by exhorting the Papi≈øts to endure Martyrdome; as likewi≈øe by ≈øo ≈øtraitly commanding all tho≈øe of his profe≈ø≈øion in England, to refu≈øe the taking of this Oath; thereby refu≈øing to profe≈ø≈øe their naturall obedience to me their Soueraigne. For if he thinke him≈øelfe my lawfull Iudge, wherefore hath he condemned me vnheard?

For what difference there is, betweene the commanding Subiects to rebell, and loo≈øing them from their Oath of Allegiance as <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> did; and the commanding of Subiects not to obey in making profe≈ø≈øion of their Oath of their duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Allegiance, as this Pope hath now done: no man can ea≈øily di≈øcerne.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

Therein hauing as well in this re≈øpect as in the former, dealt both vndi≈øcreetly with me, and iniuriou≈øly with his owne Catholickes. With mee; in not refuting particularly what ≈øpeciall words he quarrelled in that Oath; which if hee had done, it might haue beene that for the fatherly care I haue not to put any of my Subiects to a needle≈ø≈øe extremitie, I might haue beene contented in ≈øome ≈øort to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed or interpreted tho≈øe wordes.

               <p>
                  <hi>Which things ≈øince they are thus; it must euidently appeare vnto you by the words them≈øelues, That ≈øuch an Oath cannot be taken without hurting of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Faith, and the ≈øaluation of your ≈øoules; ≈øeeing it conteines many things which are flat contrary to Faith and ≈øaluation. Wherefore wee doe admoni≈øh you, that you doe vtterly ab≈øtaine from taking this and the like Oathes: which thing wee doe the more earne≈øtly require of you, becau≈øe wee haue experience of the con≈øtancie of your faith, which is tried like gold in the fire of perpetuall tribulation. Wee doe well know, that you will cheerefully vnder-goe all kinde of cruell torments what≈øoeuer, yea and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantly endure death it ≈øelfe, rather then you will in any thing offend the Maie≈øtie of</hi> GOD. <hi>And this our confidence is confirmed by tho≈øe things, which are dayly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported vnto vs, of the ≈øingular vertue, valour, and fortitude which in the≈øe la≈øt times doeth no le≈ø≈øe ≈øhine in your</hi> Martyrs, <hi>then it did in the fir≈øt beginning of the Church. Stand therefore, your loynes being girt about with veritie, and hauing on the bre≈øt-plate of righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, taking the ≈øhield of Faith, be ye ≈øtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might; And let nothing hinder you. Hee which will crowne you, and doeth in Heauen behold your conflicts, will fini≈øh the good worke which hee hath begun in you. You know how hee hath promi≈øed his di≈øciples, that hee will neuer leaue them Orphanes: for hee is faithfull which hath promi≈øed. Hold fa≈øt therefore his correction, that is, being rooted and grounded in Charitie, what≈øoeuer ye doe,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:23110:148"/>what≈øoeuer ye indeuour, doe it with one accord, in ≈øimplicitie of heart, in meekene≈ø≈øe of Spirit, without murmuring or doubting. For by this doe all men know that we are the di≈øciples of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>if we haue loue one to another. Which charitie, as it is very greatly to be de≈øired of all faithfull Christians; So certainely is it altogether ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary for you, most ble≈øsed ≈øonnes. For by this your charitie, the power of the diuel is weakened, who doeth ≈øo much a≈øsaile you, ≈øince that power of his is especially vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by the contentions and di≈øagreement of our ≈øonnes.

                  <p>It is reported vnto vs, that there are found certaine amongst you, who when as we haue ≈øufficiently declared by our Letters, dated the la≈øt yeere on the tenth of the Calends of October in the forme of a <hi>Breue,</hi> that yee cannot with ≈øafe Con≈øcience take the Oath, which was then required of you; and when as wee haue further ≈øtraitly commanded you, that by no meanes yee ≈øhould take it: yet there are ≈øome, I ≈øay, among you, which dare now affirme, that ≈øuch Letters concerning the forbidding of the Oath were not written of our owne accord, or of our owne proper will, but rather for the re≈øpect and at the in≈øtigation of other men. And for that cau≈øe the ≈øame men doe goe about to per≈øwade you, that our commands in the ≈øaid Letters are not to be regarded. Surely this newes did trouble vs; and that ≈øo much the more, becau≈øe hauing had experience of your obedience (most dearely beloued ≈øonnes) who to the end ye might obey this holy Sea, haue godlily and valiantly contemned your ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches wealth, honour, libertie, yea and life it ≈øelfe; wee ≈øhould neuer haue ≈øuspected that the trewth of our Apostolike Letters could once be called into question among you, that by this pretence ye might exempt your ≈øelues from our Commandements. But we doe herein perceiue the ≈øubtiltie and craft of the enemie of mans ≈øaluation, and we doe attribute this your backwardne≈ø≈øe rather to him, then to your owne will. And for this cau≈øe, wee haue thought good to write the ≈øecond time vnto you, and to ≈øigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vnto you againe, That our Apostolike Letters dated the last yeere on the tenth of the Calends of October, concerning the prohibition of the Oath, were written not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon our proper motion, and of our certaine knowledge, but al≈øo after long and weightie deliberation v≈øed concerning all tho≈øe things, which are contained in them; and that for that cau≈øe ye are bound fully to ob≈øerue them, reiecting all interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion per≈øwading to the contrary. And this is our meere, pure, and perfect will, being alwayes carefull of your ≈øaluation, and alwayes minding tho≈øe things, which are most profitable vnto you. And we doe pray without cea≈øing, that hee that hath appointed our lowline≈ø≈øe to the keeping of the flocke of Chri≈øt, would inlighten our thoughts and our coun≈øels: whom we doe al≈øo continually de≈øire, that he would increa≈øe in you (our beloued Sonnes) faith, constancie, and mutuall charitie and peace one to another.

And I doubt not, but that I haue liued all this while in your memory, and haue had ≈øome place in your prayers at the Lords Altar. So therfore euen vnto this time we haue abidden, as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ≈øpeaketh, in the mutuall loue one of the other, not by word or letter, but in deed and trewth. But alate me≈øsage which was brought vnto vs within the≈øe few dayes, of your bonds and impri≈øonment, hath inforced mee to breake off this ≈øilence; which me≈ø≈øage, although it ≈øeemed heauie in regard of the lo≈ø≈øe which that Church hath receiued, by their being thus depriued of the comfort of your pastorall function amongst them, yet withall it ≈øeemed ioyous, becau≈øe you drew neere vnto the glory of <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> then the which gift of God there is none more happy; That you, who haue fedde your flocke ≈øo many yeeres with the word and doctrine, ≈øhould now feed it more gloriou≈øly by the example of your patience. But another heauie tidings did not a little di≈øquiet and almost take away this ioy, which immediatly followed, of the aduer≈øaries a≈ø≈øault, and peraduenture of the ≈ølip and fall of your constancie in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing an vnlawfull Oath. Neither trewly (most deare brother) could that Oath therefore bee lawfull, becau≈øe it was offered in ≈øort tempered and modified: for you know that tho≈øe kinde of modifications are nothing el≈øe, but ≈øleights and ≈øubtilties of Satan, that the Catholique faith touching the Primacie of the Sea Apostolike, might either ≈øecretly or openly be ≈øhot at; for the which faith ≈øo many worthy Martyrs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in that very <hi>England</hi> it ≈øelfe, haue re≈øisted vnto blood. For most certaine it is, that in what≈øoeuer words the Oath is conceiued by the aduer≈øaries of the faith in that Kingdome, it tends to this end, that the Authoritie of the head of the Church in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> may bee transferred from the ≈øucce≈ø≈øour of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> to the ≈øucce≈ø≈øour of King <hi>Henry the eight:</hi> For that which is pretended of the danger of the Kings life, if the high Priest ≈øhould haue the ≈øame power in <hi>England,</hi> which hee hath in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christian Kingdomes, it is altogether idle, as all that haue any vnderstanding, may ea≈øily perceiue. For it was neuer heard of from the Churches infancie vntill this day, that euer any <hi>Pope</hi> did command, that any Prince, though an Heretike, though an Ethnike, though a per≈øecutour, ≈øhould be murdered; or did approue of the fact, when it was done by any other. And why, I pray you, doeth onely the King of <hi>England</hi> ≈øeare that, which none of all other the Princes in Christendome either doeth feare, or euer did feare?</p>

But the ≈øeruants of Christ, and especially the chiefe Prie≈øts of the Lord, ought to bee ≈øo farre from taking an vnlawfull Oath, where they may indamage the Faith, that they ought to beware that they giue not the lea≈øt ≈øuspicion of di≈øsimulation that they haue taken it, lea≈øt they might ≈øeeme to haue left any example of preuarication to faithfull people. Which thing that worthy <hi>Eleazar</hi> did most notably performe, who would neither eate ≈øwines fle≈øh, nor ≈øo much as faine to haue eaten it, although hee ≈øawe the great torments that did hang ouer his head; least, as him≈øelfe ≈øpeaketh in the ≈øecond Booke of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> many young men might bee brought through that ≈øimulation, to preuaricate with the Lawe. Neither did <hi>Ba≈øil</hi> the Great by his example, which is more fit for our purpo≈øe, cary him≈øelfe le≈ø≈øe worthily toward <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour. For as <hi>Theodoret</hi> writeth in his Historie, when the Deputy of that hereticall Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour did per≈øwade Saint <hi>Ba≈øil,</hi> that hee would not re≈øist the Emperour for a little ≈øubtiltie of a few points of doctrine; that most holy and prudent man made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwere, <hi>That it was not to be indured, that the lea≈øt ≈øyllable of Gods word ≈øhould bee corrupted, but rather all kind of torment was to be embraced, for the maintenance of the Trewth thereof.</hi> Now I ≈øuppo≈øe, that there wants not amongst you, who ≈øay that they are but ≈øubtilties of Opinions that are contained in the Oath that is offered to the Catholikes, and that you are not to ≈øtrius again≈øt the Kings Authoritie for ≈øuch a little matter. But there are not wanting al≈øo amongst you holy men like vnto <hi>Ba≈øil</hi> the Great, which will openly auow, that the very lea≈øt ≈øyllable of Gods diuine Trewth is not to bee corrupted, though many torments were to bee endured, and death it ≈øelfe ≈øet before you: Amongst whom it is meete, that you ≈øhould bee one, or rather the Standard bearer, and Generall to the re≈øt. And what≈øoeuer hath beene the cau≈øe, that your Con≈øtancie hath quailed, whether it bee the ≈øuddainene≈ø≈øe of your apprehen≈øion, or the bitterne≈ø≈øe of your per≈øecution, or the imbecilitie of your old aage: yet wee tru≈øt in the goodne≈ø≈øe of God, and in your owne long continued vertue, that it will come to pa≈ø≈øe, that as you ≈øeeme in ≈øome part to haue imitated the fall of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> ≈øo you ≈øhall happily imitate their valour in recouering your ≈øtrength, and maintaining the Trewth: For if you will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently weigh the whole matter with your ≈øelfe, trewly you ≈øhall ≈øee, it is no ≈ømall
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:23110:153"/>matter that is called in que≈øtion by this Oath, but one of the principall heads of our Faith, and foundations of Catholique Religion. For heare what your Apostle <hi>Saint Gregorie</hi> the Great hath written in his <hi>24.</hi> Epi≈øtle of his <hi>11.</hi> Booke. <hi>Let not the reuerence due to the Apo≈øtolique Sea, be troubled by any mans pre≈øump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for then the ≈øtate of the members doeth remaine entire, when the Head of the Faith is not brui≈øed by any iniurie:</hi> Therefore by <hi>Saint Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> testimonie, when they are bu≈øie about di≈øturbing or dimini≈øhing, or taking away of the Primacie of the Apo≈øtolique Sea; then are they bu≈øie about cutting off the very head of the faith, and di≈ø≈øoluing of the ≈øtate of the whole body, and of all the members.

                  <p>And for de≈øiring him to remember him in his prayers at the Altar of the Lord: if the Arch-Prie≈øts prayers prooue no more profitable to his ≈øoule, then <hi>Bellarmines</hi> coun≈øell is like to proue profitable, both to the ≈øoule and bodie of <hi>Blackwell</hi> (if he would follow it) the authour of this Letter might very well be without his prayers.</p>
                  <p>Now the fir≈øt me≈ø≈øenger that I can finde which brought ioyfull newes of the Arch-Prie≈øt to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> was hee that brought the newes of the Arch-Prie≈øts taking, and fir≈øt appearance of Martyrdome. A great ≈øigne ≈øurely of the Cardinals mortification, that hee was ≈øo reioyced to heare of the apprehen≈øion, impri≈øonment and appearance of putting to death of ≈øo old and deare a friend of his. But yet apparantly he ≈øhould fir≈øt haue beene
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:23110:156"/>≈øure, that hee was onely to bee puni≈øhed for cau≈øe of Religion, before hee had ≈øo triumphed vpon the expectation of his Martyrdome. For fir≈øt, by what rule of charitie was it lawfull for him to iudge mee a per≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals charitie.</note> before proofe had beene made of it by the ≈øaid Arch-Prie≈øts condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and death? What could hee know, that the ≈øaid Arch-Prie≈øt was not taken vpon ≈øu≈øpicion of his guiltine≈ø≈øe in the Powder-Trea≈øon? What certaine information had hee then receiued vpon the particulars, whereupon hee was to bee accu≈øed? And la≈øt of all, by what in≈øpiration could he foretell whereupon hee was to bee accu≈øed? For at that time there was yet nothing layed to his charge. And if charitie ≈øhould not bee ≈øu≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, what warrant had hee ab≈øolutely to condemne mee of v≈øing per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and tyrannie, which could not bee but implyed vpon mee, if <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> was to bee a Martyr? But ≈øurely it may iu≈øtly be ≈øayd of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this ca≈øe, that our Sauiour CHRIST ≈øaith of all worldly and carnall men, who thinke it enough to loue their
<note n="1" place="margin">Mar. 5.43.</note> friends, and hate their enemies; the limits of the Cardinals charitie extending no farther, then to them of his owne profe≈ø≈øion. For what euer hee added in ≈øuperfluous charitie to <hi>Blackwel,</hi> in reioycing in the ≈øpeculation of his future Martyrdome; hee detracted as much vniu≈øtly and vncharitably from me, in accounting of me thereby as of a bloody Per≈øecutour. And whereas this ioy of his was interrupted by the next me≈ø≈øenger, that brought the newes of the ≈øaide Arch-Prie≈øt his failing in his con≈øtancie, by taking of this Oath; he needed neuer to haue beene troubled, either with his former ioy or his ≈øecond ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, both beeing alike fal≈øly grounded. For as it was neuer my intention to lay any thing vnto the ≈øaid Arch-Prie≈øts charge, as I haue neuer done to any for cau≈øe of con≈øcience; ≈øo was <hi>Blackwels</hi> con≈øtancie neuer brangled by taking of this Oath; It beeing a thing which he euer thought lawfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his apprehen≈øion, and whereunto hee per≈øwaded all Catholiques to giue obedience; like as after his apprehen≈øion, hee neuer made doubt or ≈øtop in it; but at the fir≈øt offering it vnto him, did freely take it, as a thing mo≈øt lawfull; neither meanes of threatening, or flatterie being euer v≈øed vnto him, as him≈øelfe can yet beare witne≈ø≈øe.</p>
                  <p>And as for the temperature and modification of this Oath, except that a rea≈øonable and lawfull matter is there ≈øet downe in rea≈øonable and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate wordes, agreeing thereunto; I know not what he can meane, by quarelling it for that fault: For no temperatne≈ø≈øe nor modifications in words therein, can iu≈øtly be called the Deuils craft; when the thing it ≈øelfe is ≈øo plaine, and ≈øo plainely interpreted to all them that take it; as the onely trouble≈øome thing in it all, bee the wordes v≈øed in the end thereof, for e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewing <hi>Aequiuocation</hi> and <hi>Mentall re≈øeruation.</hi> Which new Catholike do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, may farre iu≈øtlier bee called the Deuils craft, then any plaine and temperate wordes, in ≈øo plaine and cleare a matter. But what ≈øhall we ≈øay of the≈øe ≈øtrange countrey clownes, whom of with the <hi>Satyre</hi> we may iu≈øtly complaine, that they blow both hote &amp; cold out of one mouth? For <hi>Luther</hi>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:23110:156"/>and all our bold and free-≈øpeaking Writers are mightily railed vpon by them, as hote-brained fellowes, and ≈øpeakers by the Deuils in≈øtinct: and now if we ≈øpeake moderately and temperately of them, it mu≈øt be tearmed the Deuils craft: And therefore wee may iu≈øtly complaine with CHRIST, that when we
<note n="1" place="margin">Mat. 11.17.</note> mourne, they wil not lament: and when we pipe, they wil not dance. But neither <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> his ≈øeueritie, nor CHRIST his meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe and lenitie can plea≈øe them, who build but to their owne Monarchie vpon the ground of their owne Traditions; and not to CHRIST vpon the ground of his word and infallible trewth.</p>
                  <p>But what can bee meant by alleadging, that the craft of the Deuill herein, is onely v≈øed for ≈øubuer≈øion of the Catholique Faith, and euer≈øion of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Primacie; had neede bee commented anew by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him≈øelfe: For in all this Letter of his, neuer one word is v≈øed, to prooue that by any part of this Oath the Primacie of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is any way medled with, except Ma≈øter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his bare alleadging; which without proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it by more cleare demon≈øtration, can neuer ≈øatisfie the con≈øcience of any rea≈øonable man. For (for ought that I know) heauen and earth are no farther a≈øunder, then the profe≈ø≈øion of a temporall obedience to a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall King, is different from any thing belonging to the Catholique Faith, or Supremacie of Saint <hi>Peter:</hi> For as for the Catholique Faith;
<note place="margin">No deci≈øion of any point of Religion in the Oath of Allegiance.</note> can there be one word found in all that Oath, tending or ≈øounding to matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? Doeth he that taketh it, promi≈øe there to beleeue, or not to beleeue any article of Religion? Or doeth hee ≈øo much as name a trew or fal≈øe Church there? And as for Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Primacie; I know no Apo≈øtles name that is therein named, except the name of IAMES, it being my Chri≈øten name: though it plea≈øe him not to deigne to name me in all the Letter; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, the contents thereof concerne mee in the highe≈øt degree. Neither is there any mention at all made therein, either <hi>di≈øertis verbis,</hi> or by any other indirect meanes, either of the Hierarchie of the Church, of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øion, of the Sea Apo≈øtolike, or of any ≈øuch matter: but that the Author of our Letter doeth brauely make mention of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it in compari≈øon with the ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight. Of which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt and vnmannerly ≈øimilitude, I wonder he ≈øhould not be much a≈øhamed: For as to King <hi>Henries</hi> Succe≈ø≈øour (which hee meaneth by mee) as I, I ≈øay, neuer did, nor will pre≈øume to create any Article of Faith, or to bee Iudge thereof; but to ≈øubmit my exemplarie obedience vnto them, in as great humilitie as the meane≈øt of the land: ≈øo if the Pope could bee as well able to prooue his either Per≈øonall or Doctrinall Succe≈ø≈øion from Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> as I am able to prooue my lineall de≈øcent from the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> there had neuer beene ≈øo long adoe, nor ≈øo much ≈øturre kept about this que≈øtion in Chri≈øtendome; neither had

                  <p>But now wee come to his ≈øtronge≈øt argument, which is, That he would alledge vpon mee a Panicke terrour, as if I were po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed with a needle≈ø≈øe feare:

                  <p>But ≈øure I am, if ≈øome Cardinals had not beene more wi≈øe and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect in that errand, then the <hi>Pope</hi> him≈øelfe was, the <hi>Popes</hi> owne Kalender of his Saints would haue ≈øufficiently proued <hi>Bellarmin</hi> a lier in this ca≈øe. And
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:23110:157"/>to draw yet neerer vnto our ≈øelues; how many practi≈øes and attempts were made again≈øt the late Queenes life, which were directly enioyned to tho≈øe Traitours by their Confe≈ø≈øors, and plainly authorized by the <hi>Popes</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? For verification whereof, there needs no more proofe, then that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Pope</hi> either then or ≈øince, called any Church-man in que≈øtion for med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in any tho≈øe trea≈øonable con≈øpiracies; nay, the Cardinals owne S. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derus</hi> mentioned in his Letter, could well verifie this trewth, if hee were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue; and who will looke his bookes, will finde them filled with no other doctrine then this. And what difference there is betweene the killing, or allowing the ≈ølaughter of Kings, and the ≈øtirring vp and approbation of practi≈øes to kill them; I remit to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne iudgement. It may then very clearely appeare, how ≈øtrangely this Authors pa≈ø≈øion hath made him forget him≈øelfe, by implicating him≈øelfe in ≈øo ≈øtrong a contradiction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt his owne knowledge and con≈øcience, again≈øt the witne≈ø≈øe of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bookes, and again≈øt the practi≈øe of our owne times.

And how≈øoeuer the Pope will ≈øeeme to cleare him≈øelfe of any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the ≈øaid Powder-trea≈øon, yet can it not be denied, that his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall mini≈øters here, and his chiefe <hi>Mancipia</hi> the Ie≈øuites, were the plaine
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:23110:159"/>practi≈øers thereof: for which the principall of them hath died confe≈ø≈øing it, and other haue fled the Countrey for the crime; yea, ≈øome of them gone into <hi>Italy:</hi> and yet neither the≈øe that fled out of this Countrey for it, nor yet <hi>Baldwine,</hi> who though he then remained in the Low-countreys, was of coun≈øell in it, were euer called to account for it by the Pope; much le≈ø≈øe puni≈øhed for medling in ≈øo ≈øcandalous and enormous bu≈øine≈ø≈øe. And now what needs ≈øo great wonder and exclamation, that <hi>the only King of</hi> England <hi>feareth:</hi> And <hi>what other Chri≈øtian King doeth, or euer did feare but hee?</hi> As if by the force of his rhetoricke he could make me and my good Subiects to mi≈øtru≈øt our ≈øen≈øes, deny the Sunne to ≈øhine at midday, and not with the ≈øerpent to ≈øtop our cares to his charming, but to the plaine and vi≈øible ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie it ≈øelfe.

                  <p>The≈øe contrarieties betweene the Booke of God, and <hi>Bellarmines</hi> bookes, haue I heere ≈øet in oppo≈øition each to other, <hi>Vt ex contrariis iuxta ≈øe po≈øitis, veritas magis eluce≈øcere po≈øsit.</hi> And thus farre I dare boldly affirme, that who≈øoeuer will indifferently weigh the≈øe irreconciliable contradictions here ≈øet downe, will ea≈øily confe≈ø≈øe, that CHRIST is no more contrarie to Belial, light to darkne≈ø≈øe, and heauen to hell, then <hi>Bellarmines</hi> e≈øtimation of Kings, is to Gods.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the conclu≈øion of his letter, which is onely filled with ≈øtrong and pithie exhortations, to per≈øwade and confirme <hi>Blackwell</hi> to the patient and con≈øtant induring of martyrdome, I haue nothing to an≈øwere, ≈øaue by way of regrate; that ≈øo many good ≈øentences drawen out of the Scripture, ≈øo well and ≈øo hand≈øomely packed vp together, ≈øhould be ≈øo ill and vntrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied: But an euill cau≈øe is neuer the better for ≈øo good a cloake; and an ill matter neuer amended by good wordes: And therefore I may iu≈øtly turne ouer that craft of the diuell vpon him≈øelfe, in v≈øing ≈øo holy-like an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to ≈øo euill a purpo≈øe.

                  <p>And for his <hi>Caput fidei,</hi> which I remembred before, the Apo≈øtles (I am ≈øure) neuer gaue that ≈øtyle to any, but to CHRIST: So as the≈øe ≈øtyles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ≈øome were neuer found in Scripture, and ≈øome were neuer applyed but to CHRIST in that ≈øen≈øe, as hee applieth it, had beene better to haue beene left out of ≈øo holy and mortified a letter.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then this pre≈øent Di≈øcour≈øe, I heartily wi≈øh all indifferent readers of the <hi>Breues</hi> and Letter, not to iudge by the ≈øpeciou≈øne≈ø≈øe of the wordes, but by the weight of the matter; not looking to that which is ≈øtrongly alledged, but iudiciou≈øly to con≈øider what is iu≈øtly prooued.

But now that I finde my ≈øparing to put my name vnto it hath not procured my ≈øparing by the≈øe an≈øwerers, who haue neither ≈øpared my Per≈øon directly in naming me, nor indirectly by railing vpon the Author of the Booke: it is now high time for me no longer to conceale nor di≈øauow my ≈øelfe, as if I were a≈øhamed of my owne deed. And therefore that ye may the better vnder≈øtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the cau≈øe, I will begin at the fir≈øt ground thereof.</p>
            <p>The neuer enough wondered at and abhorred POVVDER-TREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON (though the repetition thereof grieueth, I know, the gentle hearted Ie≈øuite <hi>Par≈øons</hi>) this Trea≈øon, I ≈øay, being not onely intended a gain≈øt mee and my Po≈øteritie, but euen again≈øt the whole hou≈øe of Parliament, plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely by Papi≈øts, and they onely led thereto by a prepo≈øterous zeale for the aduancement of their Religion; ≈øome of them continuing ≈øo ob≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that euen at their death they would not acknowledge their fault; but in their la≈øt words, immediatly before the expiring of their breath, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed to condemne them≈øelues and craue pardon for their deed, except the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Church ≈øhould fir≈øt condemne it; And ≈øoone after, it being di≈øcouered, that a great number of my Popi≈øh Subiects of all rankes and ≈øexes, both men and women, as well within as without the Countrey; had a confu≈øed notion and an ob≈øcure knowledge, that ≈øome great thing was to bee done in that Parliament for the weale of the Church; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, for ≈øecrecies cau≈øe, they were not acquainted with the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; certaine formes of prayer hauing likewi≈øe beene ≈øet downe and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed for the good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe of that great errand; adding heereunto, that diuers times, and from diuers Prie≈øtes, the Archtraitours them≈øelues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Sacrament for confirmation of their heart, and ob≈øeruation of ≈øecrecie; Some of the principall Ie≈øuites likewi≈øe being found guiltie of the foreknowledge of the Trea≈øon it ≈øelfe; of which number ≈øome fled from their triall, others were apprehended (as holy <hi>Garnet</hi> him≈øelfe and <hi>Owldcorne</hi> were) and iu≈øtly executed vpon their owne plaine confe≈ø≈øion of their guilt: If this Trea≈øon now, clad with the≈øe circum≈øtances, did not mini≈øter a iu≈øt occa≈øion to that Parliament hou≈øe, whome they thought to haue de≈øtroyed, courageou≈øly and zealou≈øly at their next ≈øitting downe, to v≈øe all meanes of triall, whether any more of that minde were yet left in the Countrey; I leaue it to you to iudge, whom God hath appointed his highe≈øt Depute Iudges vpon earth: And among≈øt other things for this purpo≈øe, This <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> ≈øo vniu≈øtly impugned, was then deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed and enacted. And in ca≈øe any ≈øharper Lawes were then made again≈øt the Papi≈øts, that were not obedient to the former Lawes of the Countrey; if ye will con≈øider the <hi>Time, Place</hi> and <hi>Per≈øons,</hi> it will be thought no wonder,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:23110:168"/>≈øeeing that occa≈øion did ≈øo iu≈øtly exa≈øperate them to make ≈øeuerer Lawes, then otherwi≈øe they would haue done. The <hi>Time,</hi> I ≈øay, being the very next ≈øitting downe of the Parliament, after the di≈øcouerie of that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Trea≈øon: the <hi>Place</hi> being the ≈øame, where they ≈øhould all haue bene blowne vp, and ≈øo bringing it fre≈øhly to their memorie againe: the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons</hi> being the very Parliament men whom they thought to haue de≈øtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And yet ≈øo farre hath both my heart and gouernment bene from any bitternes, as almo≈øt neuer one of tho≈øe ≈øharpe additions to the former Lawes haue euer yet bene put in execution.</p>
            <p>And that ye may yet know further, for the more conuincing the≈øe Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of wilfull malice, who impudently affirme, That this <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> was deui≈øed for deceiuing and intrapping of Papi≈øts in points of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience; The trewth is, that the Lower hou≈øe of Parliament at the fir≈øt fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of this Oath, made it to containe, That the Pope had no power to excommunicate me, which I cau≈øed them to reforme, onely making it to conclude, That no excommunication of the Popes, can warrant my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to practi≈øe again≈øt my Per≈øon or State; denying the depo≈øition of Kings to be in the Popes lawfull power; as indeed I take any ≈øuch tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall violence, to be farre without the limits of ≈øuch a Spirituall cen≈øure as Excommunication is. So carefull was I that nothing ≈øhould be contained in this Oath, except the profe≈ø≈øion of natural Allegiance, and ciuil and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall obedience, with a promi≈øe to re≈øi≈øt to all contrary vnciuill violence.</p>
            <p>This Oath now grounded vpon ≈øo great and iu≈øt an occa≈øion, ≈øet forth in ≈øo rea≈øonable termes, and ordained onely for making of a trew di≈øtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene Papi≈øts of quiet di≈øpo≈øition, and in all other things good ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and ≈øuch other Papi≈øts as in their hearts maintained the like violent bloody <hi>Maximes,</hi> that the Powder-Traitours did: This Oath, I ≈øay, being publi≈øhed and put in practi≈øe, bred ≈øuch euill blood in the Popes head and his Cleargie, as <hi>Breue</hi> after <hi>Breue</hi> commeth forth, <hi>vt vndam vnda ≈øequitur;</hi> prohibiting all Catholikes from taking the ≈øame, as a thing cleane contrary to the Catholike faith; and that the taking thereof cannot ≈øtand with the ≈øaluation of their ≈øoules.</p>
            <p>There commeth likewi≈øe a letter of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> to <hi>Blackwell</hi> to the ≈øame purpo≈øe; but di≈øcour≈øing more at length vpon the ≈øaid Oath. Whereupon, after I had entred in con≈øideration of their vniu≈øt impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that ≈øo iu≈øt and lawfull an Oath; and fearing that by their vntrew calumnies and Sophi≈øtrie the hearts of a number of the mo≈øt ≈øimple and ignorant of my people ≈øhould bee mi≈ø≈øe-led, vnder that faire and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cloake of Con≈øcience; I thought good to ≈øet foorth an <hi>Apologie</hi> for the ≈øaid Oath: wherein I prooued, that as this Oath contained nothing but matter of ciuill and temporall Obedience, due by Subiects to their Soueraigne Prince; ≈øo this quarrelling therewith was nothing but a late v≈øurpation of Popes (again≈øt the warrant of all Scriptures, ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and Fathers) vpon the Temporall power of Kings, wherewith onely
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:23110:168"/>my <hi>Apologie</hi> doeth meddle. But the publi≈øhing of this Booke of mine hath brought ≈øuch two An≈øwerers, or rather Railers vpon mee, as all the world may wonder at: For my Booke being fir≈øt written in Engli≈øh, an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh Oath being the ≈øubiect thereof, and the v≈øe of it properly belonging to my Subiects of <hi>England;</hi> and immediatly thereafter being tran≈ølated into Latine, vpon a de≈øire that ≈øome had of further publi≈øhing it abroad; it commeth home to mee now an≈øwered in both the Languages. And, I thinke, if it had bene ≈øet foorth in all the tongues that were at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion of <hi>Babel,</hi> it would haue bene returned an≈øwered in them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Thus may a man ≈øee how bu≈øie a Bi≈øhop the Diuell is, and how hee omitteth no diligence for venting of his poy≈øoned wares. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their malice doeth clearely appeare, that they pay mee ≈øo quickly with a double an≈øwere; and yet haue neuer an≈øwered their owne Arch-prie≈øt, who hath written a booke for the maintenance of the ≈øame Oath, and of the temporall authoritie of Kings, alledging a cloud of their owne Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men again≈øt them.</p>
            <p>As for the Engli≈øh <hi>An≈øwerer,</hi> my vnnaturall and fugitiue Subiect; I will neither defile my pen, nor your ≈øacred eyes or eares with the de≈øcribing of him, who a≈øhames, nay, abhorres not to raile, nay, to rage and ≈øpew foorth bla≈øphemies again≈øt the late Queene of famous memory. A Subiect to raile again≈øt his naturall Soueraigne by birth; A man to raile again≈øt a Lady by ≈øexe; A holy man (in outward profe≈ø≈øion) to in≈øult vpon the dead; nay to take <hi>Radamanthus</hi> office ouer his head, and to ≈øit downe and play the Iudge in hell, And all his quarrell is, that either her Succe≈ø≈øour, or any of her ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants ≈øhould ≈øpeake honourably of her. Cur≈øed be he that cur≈øeth the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed of God: and de≈øtroyed mought he be with the de≈øtruction of <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> that hath ≈øinned in the contradiction of <hi>Korah.</hi> Without mought ≈øuch dogs and ≈øwine be ca≈øt forth, I ≈øay, out of the Spirituall <hi>Ieru≈øalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for my Latine <hi>An≈øwerer,</hi> I haue nothing to ≈øay to his per≈øon; hee is not my Subiect; hee ≈øtandeth or falleth vnto his owne Lord: But ≈øure I am, they two haue ca≈øten lotts vpon my Booke, ≈øince they could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide it: the one of them, my fugitiue, to raile vpon my late Predece≈ø≈øour, (but a rope is the fitte≈øt an≈øwere for ≈øuch an Hi≈øtorian;) the other, a ≈øtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thinketh he may be bolde≈øt both to pay my per≈øon and my Booke, as indeed he doeth; which how iu≈øtly either in matter or maner, wee are now to examine.</p>
            <p>But fir≈øt, who ≈øhould be the trew Authour of this booke, I can but gue≈ø≈øe. Hee calleth him≈øelfe <hi>Mattheus Tortus,</hi> Cardinall <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine. A

               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:23110:169"/>≈øo little ≈øparing either Kings in generall, or my per≈øon in particular; and with ≈øuch a greatne≈ø≈øe,

<note place="margin">

The errand then being the Cardinals, and done by his owne man, it cannot but bee accounted as his owne deed; e≈øpecially ≈øince the Engli≈øh An≈øwerer doeth foure times promi≈øe, that <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or one by his appointment, ≈øhall ≈øufficiently an≈øwere it.</p>
            <p>And now to come to his matter and maner of An≈øwere: Surely if there were no more but his vnmanerly maner, it is enough to di≈øgrace the whole matter thereof. For fir≈øt, to ≈øhew his pride, in his Printers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the <hi>Politan</hi> edition of this <hi>elegans libellus,</hi> hee mu≈øt equall the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals greatne≈ø≈øe with mine in euery thing. For though hee confe≈ø≈øeth this Ma≈øter <hi>Tortus</hi> to bee an ob≈øcure man; yet being the Cardinals Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leine, he is ≈øufficient enough for≈øooth to an≈øwere an Engli≈øh booke, that lacketh the name of an Authour; as if a per≈øonated ob≈øcure name for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of a Cardinals booke, were a meete match for an≈øwering a KINGS Booke, that lacketh the name of an Authour; and a Cardinals Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leine to meete with the Deane of the Kings Chappell, whom <hi>Par≈øons</hi> with the Cardinall, haue (as it ≈øeemeth) agreed vpon to intitle to bee the Authour of my <hi>Apologie.</hi> And not onely in the Preface, but al≈øo through the whole booke doeth hee keepe this comparatiue greatne≈ø≈øe. Hee mu≈øt bee as ≈øhort in his an≈øwere, as I am in my Booke, hee mu≈øt refute all that I haue ≈øaid again≈øt the Popes ≈øecond <hi>Breue,</hi> with equall breuitie, and vpon one page almo≈øt, as I haue done mine: and becau≈øe I haue ≈øet downe the ≈øub≈øtance of the Oath in foureteene Articles; in iu≈øt as many Articles mu≈øt he ≈øet downe that Acte of Parliament of mine, wherein the Oath is contained: And yet, had hee contented him≈øelfe with his owne pride, by the demon≈øtration of his owne greatne≈ø≈øe, without further wronging of mee, it had bene the more tollerable. But what cau≈øe gaue I him to farce his whole booke with iniuries, both again≈øt my Per≈øon and Booke? For whereas in all my <hi>Apologie</hi> I haue neuer giuen him a foule word, and e≈øpecially neuer gaue him the Lye: hee by the contrary giueth mee nine times the Lye in expre≈ø≈øe termes, and ≈øeuen times chargeth mee with fal≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which phra≈øe is equiualent with a Lye. And as for all other wordes of reproch, as <hi>nugae, conuitia, temeritas, vanitas, impudentia, blasphemiae, ≈øermonis barbaries, cum eadem foelicitate ≈øcribendi, cauillationes, applicatio inepta, fingere historias, audacia quae in hominem ≈øanae mentis cadere non

               <hi>Ex Chri≈øtiano Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistam fecerunt.</hi> In another place hee ≈øayeth, <hi>Neque omnino verum e≈øt,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Iacobum nunquam de≈øerui≈ø≈øe Religionem quam prim√≤ ≈øu≈øceperat.</hi> And in another place, after that hee hath compared and ranked mee with <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the Apo≈øtate, hee concludeth, <hi>C√πm Catholicus not ≈øit,
<note place="margin">Pag. 97.</note> neque Chri≈øtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus e≈øt.</hi> If this now bee mannerly dealing with a King, I leaue it to you to iudge, who cannot but re≈øent ≈øuch indignities done to one of your qualitie.</p>
            <p>And as for the Matter of his Booke, it well fittes indeede the Manner thereof: for hee neuer an≈øwereth directly to the maine que≈øtion in my Booke. For whereas my <hi>Apologie</hi> handleth onely two points, as I told you before; One, to prooue that the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> doeth onely meddle with the ciuill and temporall Obedience, due by Subiects to their naturall So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignes: The other, that this late v≈øurpation of Popes ouer the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power of Princes, is again≈øt the rule of all Scriptures, auncient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and Fathers: hee neuer improoues the fir≈øt, but by a fal≈øe inference; that the Oath denyeth the Popes power of Excommunication directly, ≈øince it denieth his authoritie in depo≈øing of Kings. And for the ≈øecond point, he bringeth no proofe to the contrary, but, <hi>Pa≈øce oues meas:</hi> and, <hi>Tibi dabo claues regni Coelorum:</hi> and, That no Catholike euer doubted of it. So as I may trewly ≈øay of him, that hee either vnder≈øtandeth not, or at lea≈øt will not ≈øeeme to vnder≈øtand my Booke, in neuer directly an≈øwering the maine que≈øtion, as I haue alreadie ≈øaide; and ≈øo may I iu≈øtly turne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vpon him≈øelfe that doome of ignorance, which in the beginning of his Booke hee ra≈øhly pronounceth vpon mee; ≈øaying, that I neither vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand the Popes <hi>Breues,</hi> his <hi>Letter,</hi> nor the Oath it ≈øelfe: And as hee deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to repeate ouer and ouer, I know not how oft, and triumpheth in this wrong inference of his; That to deny the Popes power to depo≈øe Kings, is to denie the Popes Primacie, and his ≈øpirituall power of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: So doeth hee, vpon that ground of <hi>Pa≈øce oues meas,</hi> giue the Pope ≈øo ample a power ouer Kings, to throne or dethrone them at his plea≈øure (and yet onely ≈øubiecting Chri≈øtian Kings to that ≈ølauerie) as I doubt not but in your owne Honours yee will re≈øent you of ≈øuch indignities; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øince it concernes ≈øo many of you as profe≈ø≈øe the Romi≈øh religion, farre
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:23110:170"/>more then me: For ≈øince he accounteth me an heretike, and like <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apo≈øtate; I am con≈øequently <hi>extra caulam,</hi> and none of the Popes flocke, and ≈øo am in the ca≈øe of Ethnicke Princes, ouer whom he confe≈ø≈øeth the Pope hath no power. But yee are in the Popes folde; and you, that great Pa≈øtour may leade as ≈øheepe to the ≈ølaughter, when it ≈øhall plea≈øe him. And as the A≈ø≈øes eares mu≈øt be hornes, if the Lion li≈øt ≈øo to interprete it; ≈øo mu≈øt yee be remooued as ≈øcabbed ≈øheepe from the flocke, if ≈øo the Pope thinke you to be, though your skinne be indeed neuer ≈øo ≈øound.</p>
            <p>Thus hath he ≈øet ≈øuch a new goodly interpretation vpon the wordes of CHRIST, <hi>Pa≈øce, oues meas,</hi> as if it were as much to ≈øay, as, depo≈øe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Kings; and that <hi>Quodcunque ≈øolueris</hi> gaue the Pope power to di≈øpen≈øe with all ≈øorts of Oathes, Vowes, Penalties, Cen≈øures and Lawes, euen with the naturall obedience of Subiects to their Souereigne Lords; much like to that new coyned glo≈ø≈øe that his brother
<note n="1" place="margin">Senten. Card. Baron. ≈øuper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. Venet.</note> 
               <hi>Baronius</hi> made vpon the wordes in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> vi≈øion, <hi>Surge Petre, occide &amp; manduca;</hi> That is (≈øaid he to the Pope) Goe kill and confound the <hi>Venetians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becau≈øe I haue in my Booke (by citing a place in his controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies) di≈øcouered him to be a ≈ømall friend to Kings, he is much commoued: For whereas in his ≈øaid Controuer≈øies,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib. de Cler. cap.</hi> 28.</note> ≈øpeaking <hi>de Clericis,</hi> he is ≈øo bolde as to affirme, that Church-men are exempted from the power of earthly Kings; and that they ought them no ≈øubiection euen in temporall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but onely <hi>vi rationis</hi> and in their owne di≈øcretion, for the pre≈øerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of peace and good order, becau≈øe, I ≈øay, citing this place of his in my Booke, I tell with admiration, that hee freeth all Church-men from any ≈øubiection to Kings, euen tho≈øe that are their borne Subiects: hee is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with this phra≈øe, and ≈øayth it is an addition for breeding enuie vnto him, and rai≈øing of hatred again≈øt him: For, ≈øayth hee, although <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> affirmed generally, that Church-men were not ≈øubiect to earthly Kings; yet did hee not in≈øert that particular clau≈øe <hi>[though they were borne and dwelling in their Dominions]</hi> as if the words of Church-men and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kings in generall imported not as much: for Layickes as well as Church-men are ≈øubiect to none but to their naturall Soueraigne: And yet doeth hee not ≈øticke to confe≈ø≈øe, that he meant it, though it was not fit (he ≈øayth) to be expre≈ø≈øed.</p>
            <p>And thus quarrels hee me for reuealing his Printed ≈øecret. But who≈øe hatred did hee feare in this? was it not yours? Who haue intere≈øt, but KINGS, in withdrawing of due ≈øubiection from KINGS? And when the greate≈øt Monarches among≈øt you will remember, that almo≈øt the third part of your Subiects and of your Territories, is Church-men, and Church-liuings; I hope, yee will then con≈øider and weigh, what a feather hee pulles out of your wings, when hee denudeth you of ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Subiects and their po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, in the Popes fauour: nay, what briars and thornes are left within the heart of your dominions, when ≈øo popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and potent a partie ≈øhall haue their birth, education and liuelihood in

So as where the Church-men of old were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their tythe of euery mans goods; the Pope now will haue little le≈ø≈øe then the third part of euery Kings <hi>Subiects</hi> and <hi>Dominions.</hi> And as in this place, ≈øo throughout all the re≈øt of his booke, hee doeth nothing but amplifie the Popes power ouer Kings, and exaggerate my vnrea≈øonable rigour for pre≈ø≈øing this Oath; which hee will needs haue to bee nothing but a renewed Oath of <hi>Supremacie</hi> in more ≈øubtill and craftie termes, onely to robbe the Pope of his <hi>Primacie</hi> and ≈øpirituall power: making his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power and authoritie ouer Princes, to be one of the chiefe Articles of the Catholike Faith.</p>
            <p>But that it may the better appeare vnto you, that all my labour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in this errand, was onely to meddle with that due temporall Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which my Subiects owe vnto mee; and not to intrap or inthrall their Con≈øciences, as hee mo≈øt fal≈øely affirmes: Yee ≈øhall fir≈øt ≈øee how farre other Godly and Chri≈øtian <hi>Emperours</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> were from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the Popes temporall <hi>Supremacie</hi> ouer them; nay, haue crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, controlled and depo≈øed Popes: and next, what a number of my <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dece≈ø≈øors</hi> in this Kingdome haue at all occa≈øions, euen in the times of the greate≈øt Greatne≈ø≈øe of Popes, re≈øi≈øted and plainely with≈øtood them in this point.</p>
            <p>And fir≈øt, all Chri≈øtian <hi>Emperours</hi> were for a long time ≈øo farre from acknowledging the Popes Superioritie ouer them, as by the contrary the Popes acknowledged them≈øelues for their <hi>Va≈øsals,</hi> reuerencing and obeying the <hi>Emperours</hi> as their <hi>Lords,</hi> for proofe whereof, I remit you to my <hi>Apologie.</hi>

            <p>For further proofe whereof <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Ib≈øtocke</hi> was committed to the goale by the ≈øayde King, for hauing a ≈øuite in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ≈øeuen yeeres for the Rectorie of <hi>Newchurch.</hi>

            <p>And <hi>Edward</hi> III. following likewi≈øe the example of his Predece≈ø≈øours; Becau≈øe a Par≈øon of <hi>Liche</hi> had ≈øummoned the Prior of <hi>S. O≈øwalds</hi> before the Pope at <hi>Auinion;</hi> for hauing before the Iudges in <hi>England</hi> recouered the arrerage of a pen≈øion; directed a Precept, for ≈øea≈øing vpon all the goods both Spirituall and Temporall of the ≈øaid Par≈øon, becau≈øe hee had done this in preiudice of the King and Crowne. The ≈øaide King al≈øo made one <hi>Harwoden</hi> to bee declared culpable and worthie to bee puni≈øhed, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Popes <hi>Bulles</hi> again≈øt a Iudgement that was giuen by the Kings Iudges.</p>
            <p>And likewi≈øe; Becau≈øe one entred vpon the Priorie of <hi>Barnewell</hi> by the <hi>Popes Bul,</hi> the ≈øaid Intrant was committed to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> there to remaine during the Kings plea≈øure.</p>
            <p>So as my Predece≈ø≈øors (ye ≈øee) of this Kingdome, euen when the <hi>Popes</hi> triumphed in their greatne≈ø≈øe, ≈øpared not to puni≈øh any of their Subiects, that would preferre the <hi>Popes</hi> Obedience to theirs, euen in Church-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: So farre were they then from either acknowledging the <hi>Pope</hi> for their temporall Superiour, or yet from doubting that their owne Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were not their Subiects. And now I will clo≈øe vp all the≈øe examples with an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> in King <hi>Richard</hi> II. his time; whereby it was prohibited, That none ≈øhould procure a Benefice from <hi>Rome,</hi> vnder paine to be put out of the Kings protection. And thus may yee ≈øee, that what tho≈øe Kings ≈øucce≈ø≈øiuely one to another by foure generations haue acted in priuate, the ≈øame was al≈øo maintained by a publike Law.</p>
            <p>By the≈øe few examples now (I hope) I haue ≈øufficiently cleered my ≈øelfe from the imputation, that any ambition or de≈øire of Noueltie in mee ≈øhould haue ≈øtirred mee, either to robbe the <hi>Pope</hi> of any thing due vnto him, or to a≈ø≈øume vnto my ≈øelfe any farther authoritie, then that which other Chri≈øtian <hi>Emperours</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> through the world, and my owne Predece≈ø≈øours of <hi>England</hi> in e≈øpeciall, haue long agone maintained. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it enough to ≈øay (as <hi>Par≈øons</hi> doeth in his An≈øwere to the Lord <hi>Coke</hi>) That farre more Kings of this Countrey haue giuen many more exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of acknowledging, or not re≈øi≈øting the <hi>Popes</hi> v≈øurped Authorities; ≈øome
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:23110:172"/>perchance lacking the occa≈øion; and ≈øome the abilitie of re≈øi≈øting them: for euen by the Ciuill Law, in the ca≈øe of violent intru≈øion and long and wrongfull po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion again≈øt mee, it is enough if I prooue that I haue made lawfull interruption vpon conuenient occa≈øions.</p>
            <p>But the Cardinall thinkes the Oath, not onely vnlawfull for the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance therof, but al≈øo in regard of the Per≈øon whom vnto it is to be ≈øworne: For (≈øaith he) <hi>The King is not a Catholique;</hi> And in two or three other places of his booke, he ≈øticketh not to call me by my name very broadly, an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, as I haue already told. But yet before I be publikely declared an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike; by the Popes owne Law my people ought not to refu≈øe their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto me. And (I tru≈øt) if I were but a ≈øubiect, and accu≈øed by the Pope in his <hi>Conclaue</hi> before his Cardinals, hee would haue hard prouing mee an Heretike, if he iudged me by their owne ancient Orders.</p>
            <p>For fir≈øt, I am no <hi>Apo≈øtate,</hi> as the Cardinal would make me; not onely ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing euer bene brought vp in that Religion which I pre≈øently profe≈ø≈øe, but euen my Father and Grandfather on that ≈øide profe≈ø≈øing the ≈øame: and ≈øo cannot be properly an Heretike, by their owne doctrine, ≈øince I neuer was of their Church. And as for the Queene my Mother of worthy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; although ≈øhe continued in that Religion wherein ≈øhee was nouri≈øhed, yet was ≈øhe ≈øo farre from being ≈øuper≈øtitious or <hi>Ie≈øuited</hi> therein, that at my Bapti≈øme (although I was baptized by a Popi≈øh Archbi≈øhop) ≈øhe ≈øent him word to forbeare to v≈øe the ≈øpettle in my Bapti≈øme; which was obeyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed a filthy and an api≈øh tricke, rather in ≈øcorne then imitation of CHRIST. And her owne very words were, <hi>That ≈øhe would not haue a pockie priest to ≈øpet in her childs mouth.</hi> As al≈øo the Font wherein I was Chri≈øtened, was ≈øent from the late Queene here of famous memory, who was my God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother; and what her Religion was, <hi>Pius V.</hi> was not ignorant. And for further proofe, that that renowmed Queene my Mother was not ≈øuper≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; as in all her Letters (whereof I receiued many) ≈øhe neuer made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion, nor laboured to per≈øwade me in it; ≈øo at her la≈øt words, ≈øhe commanded her Ma≈øter-hou≈øhold, a Scotti≈øh Gentleman my ≈øeruant and yet aliue, ≈øhe commanded him (I ≈øay) to tell me; That although ≈øhe was of another Religion then that wherein I was brought vp; yet ≈øhe would not pre≈ø≈øe me to change, except my owne Con≈øcience forced mee to it: For ≈øo that I led a good life, and were carefull to doe Iu≈øtice and gouerne well; ≈øhe doubted not but I would be in a good ca≈øe with the profe≈ø≈øion of my owne Religion. Thus am I no <hi>Apo≈øtate,</hi> nor yet a deborder from that Religion which one part of my Parents profe≈ø≈øed, and an other part gaue mee good allowance of. Neither can my Bapti≈øme in the rites of their Religion make me an <hi>Apo≈øtate,</hi> or Heretike in re≈øpect of my pre≈øent profe≈ø≈øion, ≈øince we all agree in the ≈øub≈øtance thereof, being all Baptized <hi>In the Name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost:</hi> vpon which head there is no variance among≈øt vs.</p>
            <p>And now for the point of Heretike; I will neuer bee a≈øhamed to render
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:23110:173"/>an accompt of my profe≈ø≈øion, and of that hope that is in me, as the Apo≈øtle pre≈øcribeth. I am ≈øuch a CATHOLIKE CHRISTIAN, as belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the three <hi>Creeds;</hi> That of the Apo≈øtles, that of the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> and that of <hi>Athana≈øius;</hi> the two latter being Paraphra≈øes to the former: And I beleeue them in that ≈øen≈øe, as the ancient Fathers and Councels that made them did vnder≈øtand them: To which three <hi>Creeds</hi> all the Mini≈øters of England doe ≈øub≈øcribe at their Ordination. And I al≈øo acknowledge for Orthodoxe all tho≈øe other formes of <hi>Creedes,</hi> that either were deui≈øed by Councels or particular Fathers, again≈øt ≈øuch particular Here≈øies as mo≈øt reigned in their times.</p>
            <p>I reuerence and admit the foure fir≈øt generall Councels as Catholique and Orthodoxe: And the ≈øaid foure generall Councels are acknowledged by our Acts of Parliament, and receiued for Orthodoxe by our Church.</p>
            <p>As for the Fathers; I reuerence them as much and more then the <hi>Ie ≈øuites</hi> doe, and as much as them≈øelues euer craued. For what euer the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for the fir≈øt fiue hundreth yeeres did with an vnanime con≈øent agree vpon, to be beleeued as a nece≈ø≈øary point of ≈øaluation, I either will beleeue it al≈øo, or at lea≈øt will be humbly ≈øilent; not taking vpon mee to condemne the ≈øame: But for euery priuate Fathers opinion, it bindes not my con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence more then <hi>Bellarmines;</hi> euery one of the Fathers v≈øually contradicting others.

            <p>As for the Scriptures; no man doubteth I will beleeue them: But euen for the <hi>Apocrypha;</hi> I hold them in the ≈øame accompt that the Ancients did: They are ≈øtill printed and bound with our Bibles, and publikely read in our Churches: I reuerence them as the writings of holy and good men: but ≈øince they are not found in the <hi>Canon,</hi> wee accompt them to bee <hi>≈øecundae lectionis,</hi> or

            <p>As for the Saints departed, I honour their memory, and in honour of them doe we in our Church ob≈øerue the dayes of ≈øo many of them, as the Scripture doeth canonize for Saints; but I am loath to beleeue all the tales of the <hi>Legended ≈øaints.</hi>

            <p>And fir≈øt for the ble≈ø≈øed Virgin MARIE, I yeeld her that which the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> pronounced of her, and which in her <hi>Canticle</hi> ≈øhee prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied of her≈øelfe: that is, That

<note n="4" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 48.</note> That all generations ≈øhall call her ble≈ø≈øed. I reuerence her as the Mother of CHRIST, whom of our Sauiour tooke his fle≈øh, and ≈øo the Mother
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:23110:173"/>of GOD, ≈øince the Diuinitie and Humanitie of CHRIST are in≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And I freely confe≈ø≈øe, that ≈øhee is in glory both aboue Angels and men, her owne Sonne (that is both GOD and man) onely excepted. But I dare not mocke her and bla≈øpheme again≈øt GOD, calling her not onely <hi>Diua</hi> but <hi>Dea,</hi> and praying her to command and controule her Sonne, who is her GOD; and her SAVIOVR: Nor yet not I thinke, that ≈øhee hath no other thing to doe in heauen, then to heare euery idle mans ≈øuite, and bu≈øie her ≈øelfe in their errands; whiles reque≈øting, whiles commanding her Sonne, whiles comming downe to ki≈ø≈øe and make loue with Prie≈øtes, and whiles di≈øputing and brawling with Deuils. In heauen ≈øhee is in eternall glory and ioy, neuer to bee interrupted with any worldly bu≈øine≈ø≈øe; and there I leaue her with her ble≈ø≈øed Sonne our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOVR and hers in eternall felicitie.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Prayer to Saints;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mart. 11.28.</note> CHRIST (I am ≈øure) hath commanded vs to Come all to him that are loaden with ≈øinne, and hee will relieue vs: and <hi>Saint Paul</hi> hath forbidden vs to wor≈øhip Angels;
<note place="margin">Colo≈ø≈ø. 2.8, 23.</note> or to v≈øe any ≈øuch voluntary wor≈øhip, that hath a ≈øhew of humilitie in that it ≈øpareth not the fle≈øh. But what warrant wee haue to haue recour≈øe vnto the≈øe <hi>Dij Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates</hi> or <hi>Tutelares,</hi> the≈øe Courtiers of GOD, I know not; I remit that to the≈øe Philo≈øophicall Neoterike Diuines. It ≈øatisfieth mee to pray to GOD through CHRIST as I am commanded, which I am ≈øure mu≈øt be the ≈øafe≈øt way; and I am ≈øure the ≈øafe≈øt way is the be≈øt way in points of ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. But if the Romi≈øh Church hath coined new Articles of Faith, neuer heard of in the fir≈øt 500. yeeres after CHRIST, I hope I ≈øhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee condemned for an Heretike, for not being a Noueli≈øt. Such are the <hi>priuate Ma≈øses,</hi> where the Prie≈øt playeth the part both of the Prie≈øt and of the people; And ≈øuch are the <hi>Amputation of the one halfe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> from the people; <hi>The Tran≈øsubstantiation, Eleuation for Adoration,</hi> and <hi>Circumportation</hi> in Proce≈ø≈øion of the Sacrament; <hi>the workes of Superero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> rightly named <hi>The≈øaurus Eccle≈øiae; the Bapti≈øing of Bels,</hi> and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand other trickes: But aboue all, <hi>the wor≈øhipping of Images.</hi> If my faith beeweake in the≈øe, I confe≈ø≈øe I had rather beleeue too little then too much: And yet ≈øince I beleeue as much as the Scriptures doe warrant, the Creeds doe per≈øwade, and the ancient Councels decreed, I may well be a Schi≈øma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike from <hi>Rome,</hi> but I am ≈øure I am no Heretike.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Reliques of Saints;</hi> If I had any ≈øuch that I were a≈ø≈øured were members of their bodies, I would honourably bury them, and not giue them the reward of condemned mens members, which are onely ordeined to bee depriued of buriall. But for wor≈øhipping either them or <hi>Images,</hi> I mu≈øt account it damnable Idolatrie.</p>
            <p>I am no <hi>Iconomachus;</hi> I quarrell not the making of Images, either for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like decoration, or for mens priuate v≈øes: But that they ≈øhould bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhipped, bee prayed to, or any holine≈ø≈øe attributed vnto them, was neuer knowen of the Ancients: And the Scriptures are ≈øo directly, vehemently
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:23110:174"/>and punctually again≈øt it, as I wonder what braine of man, or ≈øugge≈øtion of Sathan dur≈øt offer it to Chri≈øtians; and all mu≈øt bee ≈øalued with nice Philo≈øophicall di≈øtinctions: As, <hi>Idolum nihilest:</hi> and, They wor≈øhip (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øooth) the Images of things <hi>in being,</hi> and the Image of the trew GOD. But the Scripture forbiddeth to wor≈øhip the Image of any thing that GOD created. It was not a <hi>nibil</hi> then that God forbade onely to be wor≈øhipped, neither was the bra≈øen Serpent, nor the body of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> a <hi>nihil;</hi> and yet the one was de≈øtroyed, and the other hidden for e≈øchewing of Idolatrie. Yea, the Image of GOD him≈øelfe is not onely expre≈øly forbidden to bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhipped, but euen to bee made. The rea≈øon is giuen, That no eye euer ≈øaw GOD; and how can we paint his face, when <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> (the man that euer was mo≈øt familiar with GOD) neuer ≈øawe but his backe parts? Surely, ≈øince he cannot be drawen to the <hi>viue,</hi> it is a thankele≈ø≈øe labour to marre it with a fal≈øe repre≈øentation; which no Prince, nor ≈øcarce any other man will bee contented with in their owne pictures. Let them therefore that maintaine this doctrine, an≈øwere it to CHRIST at the latter day, when he ≈øhall accu≈øe them of Idolatrie; And then I doubt if hee will bee payed with ≈øuch nice ≈øophi≈øticall Di≈øtinctions.</p>
            <p>But CHRISTS Cro≈ø≈øe mu≈øt haue a particular priuiledge (≈øay they) and bee wor≈øhipped <hi>ratione contactus.</hi> But fir≈øt wee mu≈øt know what kinde of touching of CHRISTS body drew a vertue from it; whether euery touching, or onely touching by faith? That euery touching of his body drew not vertue from it, is more then manife≈øt. When
<note n="1" place="margin">Luke 8.</note> the woman in the bloody fluxe touched him, ≈øhe was healed of her faith: But <hi>Peter</hi> then told him that a crowd and throng of many people then touched him; and yet none of them receiued any benefite or vertue from him. <hi>Iudas</hi> touched him many and many a time, be≈øides his la≈øt ki≈ø≈øe; ≈øo did the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines that buffeted and crucified him; and yet I may ≈øafely pronounce them accur≈øed, that would be≈øtow any wor≈øhip vpon their reliques: yea wee cannot denie but the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> it≈øelfe (whereupon our Lord did dayly tread) is ≈øo vi≈øibly accur≈øed, beeing gouerned by faithle≈ø≈øe <hi>Turkes,</hi> full of innumerable ≈øects of hereticall Chri≈øtians, and the very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie thereof ≈øo farre degenerated into a pitifull ≈øterilitie, as hee mu≈øt bee accur≈øed that accounteth it ble≈ø≈øed. Nay, when a certaine

And put the ca≈øe it had a vertue of doing miracles, as <hi>Peters</hi> ≈øhadow had; yet doeth it not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it is lawful to wor≈øhip it, which <hi>Peter</hi> would neuer accept of. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Prophets that in ≈øo many places cur≈øe tho≈øe that wor≈øhip Images, that haue eyes and ≈øee not, that haue eares and heare not, would much more haue cur≈øed them that wor≈øhip a piece of a ≈øticke, that hath not ≈øo much

            <p>Of <hi>Bi≈øhops</hi> and Church Hierarchie I very well allowe (as I ≈øaid before) and likewi≈øe of Ranks and Degrees among≈øt <hi>Bi≈øhops.

               <hi>Corinth</hi> for making exception of Per≈øons, becau≈øe ≈øome followed <hi>Paul,</hi> ≈øome <hi>Apollos,</hi> ≈øome <hi>Cephas,</hi> if <hi>Peter</hi> was their vi≈øible Head!
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.12.</note> for then tho≈øe that followed not <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> renounced the Catholike faith. But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth well that <hi>Paul</hi> knew little of our new doctrine, ≈øince he handleth <hi>Peter</hi> ≈øo rudely,
<note place="margin">Galat. 2.</note> as he not onely compareth but preferreth him≈øelfe vnto him. But our Cardinall proues <hi>Peters</hi> ≈øuperioritie,
<note place="margin">Galat. 1.18.</note> by <hi>Pauls</hi> going to vi≈øite him. Indeed <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith, hee went to <hi>Ieru≈øalem</hi> to vi≈øite <hi>Peter,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with him; but he ≈øhould haue added, and to ki≈ø≈øe his feet.</p>
            <p>To conclude then, The trweth is that <hi>Peter</hi> was both in aage, and in the time of CHRISTS calling him, one of the fir≈øt of the Apo≈øtles; In order the principall of the fir≈øt twelue, and one of the three whom CHRIST for order ≈øake preferred to all the re≈øt. And no further did the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome</hi> claime for three hundred yeeres after CHRIST: Subiect they were to the generall Councels, and euen but of late did the Councell of <hi>Con≈øtance</hi> depo≈øe three Popes, and ≈øet vp the fourth. And vntill Phocas dayes (that murthered his ma≈øter) were they ≈øubiect to Emperours. But how they are now come to be <hi>Chri≈øts</hi> Vicars, nay, Gods on earth, triple-crowned, Kings of heauen, earth and hell, Iudges of all the world, and none to iudge them; Heads of the faith, Ab≈øolute deciders of all Controuer≈øies by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of their ≈øpirit, hauing all power both Spirituall and Temporall in their hands; the high Bi≈øhops, Monarches of the whole earth, Superiours to all Emperours and Kings; yea, Supreme Vice-gods, who whether they will or not cannot erre: how they are now come (I ≈øay) to the toppe of greatne≈ø≈øe, I know not: but ≈øure I am, Wee that are KINGS haue greate≈øt neede to looke vnto it. As for me, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> I know, but the≈øe men I know not: And yet to doubt of this, is to denie the Catholique faith; Nay, the world it ≈øelfe mu≈øt be turned vp≈øide downe,

            <p>Thus haue I now made a free Confe≈ø≈øion of my Faith: And (I hope) I haue fully cleared my ≈øelfe from being an Apo≈øtate, and as farre from being an Heretike, as one may bee that beleeueth the Scriptures, and the three Creedes, and acknowledgeth the foure fir≈øt generall Councels.

As for the definition of the <hi>Antichri≈øt,</hi> I will not vrge ≈øo ob≈øcure a point, as a matter of Faith to bee nece≈ø≈øarily beleeued of all Chri≈øtians; but what I thinke herein, I will ≈øimply declare.</p>
            <p>That there mu≈øt be an <hi>Antichri≈øt,</hi> and in his time a generall Defection; wee all agree.

<note place="margin">2. The≈ø. 2.</note> As for my opinion; I thinke S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 2. to the <hi>The≈ø≈øalonians</hi> doeth vtter more clearely that which <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> ≈øpeaketh more my≈øtically of the <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, that in that place hee meaneth the <hi>Antichri≈øt,</hi> it is plaine, ≈øince hee ≈øaith,
<note place="margin">Ver≈øe 3.</note> 
               <hi>There mu≈øt bee first a Defection;</hi> and that in the <hi>Antichri≈øts</hi> time onely that eclip≈øe of Defection mu≈øt fall vpon the Church, all the <hi>Romi≈øh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes</hi> are ≈øtrong enough: otherwi≈øe their Church mu≈øt be daily ≈øubiect to erre,
<note place="margin">Ver≈øe 3, 4.</note> which is cleane contrary to their maine doctrine.

            <p>And after that S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath thus de≈øcribed the <hi>Per≈øon,</hi> he next de≈øcribeth the <hi>Seat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. The≈ø≈ø. 2.4.</note> and telleth that <hi>He ≈øhall ≈øit in the Temple of God,</hi> that is, the bo≈øome of the Church; yea, in the very heart thereof. Now where this Apo≈øtolike Seat is, I leaue to bee gue≈ø≈øed: And likewi≈øe who it is that ≈øitting there, ≈øheweth him≈øelfe to be GOD; pardoning ≈øinnes, redeeming ≈øoules, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining Faith, controlling and iudging all men, and to be iudged of none.</p>
            <p>Anent the <hi>Time, S. Paul</hi> is plaine≈øt of all: For hee calleth the <hi>The≈ø≈øalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> to memorie,

And that he meant not <hi>that man of Sinne</hi> of the≈øe Ethnicke Emperours in his time, his introduction to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:23110:176"/>this di≈øcour≈øe maketh it more then manife≈øt.

            </p>
            <p>Thus haue I prooued out of <hi>S.

S.

               <note place="margin">Reuel. 17. v. 1. Ver≈ø. 3.</note> concluding that chapter with calling that Woman, <hi>that great City which reigneth ouer the Kings of the earth.</hi> And both in that Chapter,

            </p>
            <p>So as to continue herein my formerly purpo≈øed Methode, of the Time, Seat, and Per≈øon of Antichri≈øt; this place doth clearely and vndenyably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that <hi>Rome</hi> is, or ≈øhalbe the Seat of that Antichri≈øt. For fir≈øt, no Papi≈øt now denieth that by <hi>Babylon</hi> here <hi>Rome</hi> is directly meant; and that this Woman is the Antichri≈øt, doeth clearely appeare by the time of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (de≈øcribed by 42. moneths in the xiij. Chap.)
<note place="margin">Ver≈ø. 5.</note> which doeth iu≈øtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with that three yeeres and a halfes time, which all the Papi≈øts giue to the Reigne of Antichri≈øt. Be≈øides that, the Bea≈øt it ≈øelfe with ≈øeuen heads and tenne hornes, hauing one of her heads wounded and healed againe, is de≈øcribed iu≈øt alike in the xiij. and xvij. Chap. being in the former prooued
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:23110:177"/>to be the <hi>Antichrist</hi> by the time of her reigne; and in the latter <hi>Rome</hi> by the name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the confe≈ø≈øion of all the Papi≈øts, So as one point is now cleare, that <hi>Rome</hi> is the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither will that place in the eleuenth Chapter ≈øerue to ≈øhift off this point, and proue the <hi>Antichrists Seat</hi> to bee in <hi>Ieru≈øalem;</hi> where it is ≈øaide;
<note place="margin">Chap. 11.8.</note> 
               <hi>That the Corp≈øes of the Witne≈ø≈øes ≈øhall lie in the great City, ≈øpiritually Sodome and Egypt, where our Lord al≈øo was crucified.</hi> For the word <hi>≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> is applied both to <hi>Sodome, Egypt</hi> and <hi>Ieru≈øalem</hi> in that place; And when hee hath named <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> hee doeth not ≈øubioyne <hi>Ieru≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> with a ≈øingle <hi>vbi;</hi> but with an <hi>vbi &amp;,</hi> as if hee would ≈øay; and this <hi>Antichri≈øts</hi> abomination ≈øhall bee ≈øo great, as his Seate ≈øhall bee as full of Spirituall whoredomes and Idolatries, as <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> was; nay, and ≈øo bloody in the per≈øecution of the Saints, as our Lord ≈øhall be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againe in his members.

<note place="margin">Matt. 25.40.</note> to call CHRIST per≈øecuted and ≈ølaine, when his Saints are ≈øo v≈øed?
<note place="margin">Acts 9.4.</note> So did CHRIST ≈øay, ≈øpeaking of the latter day; and in the ≈øame ≈øtyle did hee ≈øpeake to <hi>S. Paul</hi> at his conuer≈øion. And that <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> (≈øince <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is contented it bee ≈øo called) is that great Citie where our Lord was crucified,
<note place="margin">Reuel. 18.24.</note> the la≈øt ver≈øe of the xviij. Chap. doeth al≈øo clearely proue it: For there it is ≈øaid, That <hi>in that City was found the blood of the Prophets, and of the Saints, and of all that were ≈ølaine vpon the earth;</hi> and I hope CHRIST was one of them that were ≈ølaine vpon the earth. And be≈øides that it may well bee ≈øaid that hee was ≈ølaine in that great Citie <hi>Babylon,</hi> ≈øince by the <hi>Romane</hi> authoritie hee was put to death, vnder a <hi>Romane</hi> Iudge, and for a <hi>Romane</hi> quarrell: for he could not be a friend to <hi>Cae≈øar,</hi> that was not his enemie.</p>
            <p>This point now being cleared of the <hi>Antichri≈øts Seate,</hi> as I haue already ≈øayd; we are next to find out the <hi>Time</hi> when the <hi>Antichri≈øt</hi> ≈øhall reigne, if it be not already come.
<note place="margin">Cha. 13.3.</note> In the xiij. Chapter. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ≈øaith, that this Bea≈øt with the ≈øeuen heads and tenne hornes,
<note place="margin">Chap. 17.10.</note> 
               <hi>had one of his heads wounded and healed againe;</hi> and interpreting that in the xvij. he ≈øaith, that <hi>the≈øe ≈øeuen heads are al≈øo ≈øeuen Kings, whereof fiue are fallen, one is, and an other is not yet come, and when hee commeth hee ≈øhall continue a ≈øhort ≈øpace.
<note place="margin">Ver≈øe 11.</note> And the Bea≈øt that was and is not, is the eight, and yet one of the ≈øeuen.</hi> By which Bea≈øt hee meaneth the <hi>Antichri≈øt,</hi> who was not then come, I meane in the Apo≈øtles dayes, but was to come after. So as betweene the time of the Apo≈øtles and the ende of the worlde, mu≈øt the <hi>Time</hi> of the <hi>Antichri≈øts</hi> comming be; and with this the Papi≈øts doe al≈øo agree. Whereby it appeareth that <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is <hi>Rome,</hi> ≈øhall bee the <hi>Seate</hi> of the <hi>Antichri≈øt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reuel. 1.1. &amp; chap. 4.1.</note> but not that <hi>Ethnicke Rome</hi> which was in the Apo≈øtles dayes (for <hi>Iohn</hi> him≈øelfe profe≈ø≈øeth that hee is to write of nothing, but that which is to come after his time.)

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:23110:177"/>Bi≈øhops: But that <hi>Antichristian Rome,</hi> when as the Antichri≈øt ≈øhal ≈øet downe his ≈øeat there, after that by the working of that My≈øterie of iniquitie, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Rome</hi> ≈øhall become to be corrupted; and ≈øo that deadly wound, which the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandales</hi> gaue Rome, ≈øhall bee cured in that Head or King, the <hi>Antichri≈øt,</hi> who thereafter ≈øhall ari≈øe and reigne for a long ≈øpace.</p>
            <p>But here it may bee obiected, that the <hi>Antichri≈øt</hi> cannot reigne a long ≈øpace; ≈øince S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øaith in two or three ≈øundry places, that the <hi>Antichrist</hi> ≈øhall worke but the ≈øpace of three yeeres and a halfe.

            <p>Hauing now made this digre≈ø≈øion anent the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> which I am ≈øure I can better fa≈øten vpon the Pope, then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can doe his pretended Temporall Superioritie ouer Kings: I will returne againe to ≈øpeake of this An≈øwerer; who (as I haue already told you) ≈øo fitteth his matter with his manner of an≈øwering, that as his Style is nothing but a Satyre and heape full of iniurious and reprochfull ≈øpeaches, as well again≈øt my Per≈øon, as my Booke; ≈øo is his matter as full of lyes and fal≈øities indeed, as hee vniu≈øtly layeth to my charge: For three lies hee maketh again≈øt the Oath of Alleagiance, conteined and maintained in my Booke; be≈øides that ordinary repeated lie again≈øt my Booke, of his omitting to an≈øwere my lyes, trattles, iniurious ≈øpeaches and bla≈øphemies.

And vncomely it mu≈øt needs be (in my opinion) for a <hi>King</hi> to fall in altercation with a <hi>Cardinal,</hi> at lea≈øt with one no more nobly de≈øcended then he is: That Eccle≈øia≈øticall dignitie, though by the ≈øloath of Princes (as I ≈øaid before) it be now come to that height of v≈øurped honour, yet being in the trew originall and foundation thereof nothing el≈øe, but the title of the Prie≈øts and Deacons of the Pari≈øh Churches in the towne of <hi>Rome;</hi> at the fir≈øt, the ≈øtile of <hi>Cardinals</hi> being generally giuen to all Prie≈øts and Deacons of any Cathedral Church, though the multitude of ≈øuch <hi>Cardinal</hi> Prie≈øts and Deacons re≈øorting to <hi>Rome,</hi> was the cau≈øe that after bred the re≈øtraining of that title of <hi>Cardinall</hi> Prie≈øts and Deacons, onely to the Pari≈øh-prie≈øts and Deacons of <hi>Rome.</hi> And ≈øince that it is <hi>S.

               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:23110:187"/>Thus may ye ≈øee, how vpon the one part our <hi>Cardinall</hi> will haue all Kings and Monarchs to bee the <hi>Popes Va≈ø≈øals;</hi> and yet will not on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øide, allow the meane≈øt of the <hi>Pope</hi> his va≈ø≈øals, to be ≈øubiect to any Chri≈øtian Prince.

For hauing taken occa≈øion to reui≈øite againe his bookes of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer≈øies, and to correct or explaine what he findeth ami≈ø≈øe or mi≈øtaketh in them; in imitation of S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> his retractions (for ≈øo he ≈øaith in his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>) he doth in place of retracting any of his former errours, or any matter of ≈øub≈øtance; not retract, but <hi>recant</hi> indeed, I meane ≈øing ouer againe, and ob≈øtinatly confirme a number of the gro≈ø≈øe≈øt of them: Among the which, the exempting of all Church-men from ≈øubiection to any Temporall Prince, and the ≈øetting vp not onely of the <hi>Pope,</hi> but euen of the People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue their naturall King; are two of his maine points.</p>
            <p>As for the exemption of the Clerickes; he is ≈øo greedy there to proue that point, as he denieth <hi>Cae≈øar</hi> to haue beene <hi>Pauls</hi> lawfull Iudge:
<note place="margin">Acts. 25.10.</note> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the expre≈ø≈øe Text, and <hi>Pauls</hi> plaine Appellation, and acknowledging him his Iudge; be≈øides his many times claiming to the Roman priuiledges,
<note place="margin">Actes 22.28.</note> and auowing him≈øelfe a Roman by freedome; and therefore of nece≈ø≈øitie a Subiect to the Roman Emperour. But it is a wonder that the≈øe <hi>Romane Catholikes,</hi> who vaunt them≈øelues of the ancientie both of their doctrine and Church, and reproch vs ≈øo bitterly of our Nouelties, ≈øhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhamed to make ≈øuch a new inept glo≈ø≈øe as this vpon S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Text; which as it is directly contrary to the Apo≈øtles wordes, ≈øo is it without any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, either of any ancient <hi>Councell,</hi> or of ≈øo much as any one particular <hi>Father</hi> that euer interprets that place in this ≈øort: Neither was it euer doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any Chri≈øtian in the Primitiue Church, that the Apo≈øtles, or any other degree of Chri≈øtians, were ≈øubiect to the Emperour.</p>
            <p>And as for the ≈øetting vp of the People aboue their owne naturall King, he bringeth in that principle of Sedition, that he may thereby proue, that Kings haue not their power and authoritie immediatly from God, as the Pope hath his: For euery King (≈øaith he) is made and cho≈øen by his people; nay, they doe but ≈øo transferre their power in the Kings per≈øon, as they doe notwith≈øtanding retaine their habituall power in their owne hands, which vpon certaine occa≈øions they may actually take to them≈øelues againe. This, I am ≈øure, is an excellent ground in Diuinitie for all Rebels and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious people, who are hereby allowed to rebell again≈øt their Princes; and a≈ø≈øume libertie vnto them≈øelues, when in their di≈øcretions they ≈øhall thinke it conuenient.</p>
            <p>And among≈øt his other Te≈øtimonies for probation, that all Kings are made and created by the People; he alledgeth the Creation of three Kings in the Scripture, <hi>Saul, Dauid</hi> and <hi>Ieroboam;</hi> and though hee bee compelled by the expre≈ø≈øe words of the Text, to confe≈ø≈øe, that God by his

<note n="2" place="margin">1. Sam. 16.12.13.</note> 
               <hi>Dauid;</hi> yet will he, by the po≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øent of the people, proue that tho≈øe Kings were not immediatly made by God, but mediatly by the people; though he repeat thri≈øe that word of <hi>Lott,</hi> by the ca≈øting whereof he confe≈ø≈øeth that <hi>Saul</hi> was cho≈øen.

But as it were a bla≈øphemous impietie, to doubt that <hi>Matthias</hi> was immediatly cho≈øen by GOD, and yet was hee cho≈øen by the ca≈øting of Lots, as <hi>Saul</hi> was: ≈øo is it well enough knowen to ≈øome of you (my louing <hi>Brethren</hi>) by what holy Spirit or ca≈øting of Lots the <hi>Popes</hi> v≈øe to be elected; the Colledge of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> his electors, hauing beene diuided in two mightie factions euer ≈øince long before my time; and in place of ca≈øting of Lotts, great fat pen≈øions beeing ca≈øt into ≈øome of their greedy mouthes for the election of the <hi>Pope,</hi> according to the partiall humours of Princes. But I doe mo≈øt of all wonder at the weakene≈ø≈øe of his memorie: for in this place he maketh the po≈øt-con≈øent of the people to be the thing that made both the≈øe Kings, notwith≈øtanding of their preceding inauguration and anoyntment by the Prophet at GODS commandement; forgetting that in the beginning of this ≈øame little booke of his, an≈øwering one that alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth a ≈øentence of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> to prooue that the Bi≈øhops were iudged by the people in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, he there confe≈ø≈øeth, that by the≈øe words, the <hi>con≈øent of the people</hi> to the Bi≈øhops Election mu≈øt be onely vnder≈øtood. Nor will he there any wayes be mooued to graunt, that the peoples power, in con≈øenting to or refu≈øing the Election of a Bi≈øhop, ≈øhould be ≈øo vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood, as that thereby they haue <hi>power to elect Bi≈øhops:</hi> And yet do the≈øe words of <hi>Cyprian</hi> ≈øeeme to bee farre ≈øtronger, for granting the peoples power to elect Churchmen, then any words that he alledgeth out of the Scripture are for the peoples power in electing a King. For the very words of <hi>Cyprian</hi> by him≈øelfe there cited,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cyprian. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epi≈øt.</hi> 4.</note> are, That <hi>the very people haue prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally the power, either to chu≈øe ≈øuch Prie≈øts as are worthy, or to refu≈øe ≈øuch as are vnworthie:</hi> And, I hope, hee can neuer prooue by the Scripture, that it had beene lawfull to the people of I≈ørael, or that it was left in their choi≈øe, to haue admitted or refu≈øed <hi>Saul</hi> or <hi>Dauid</hi> at their plea≈øure, after that the Prophet had anoynted them, and per≈øented them vnto them.</p>
            <p>Thus ye ≈øee how little he careth (euen in ≈øo little a volume) to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict him≈øelfe, ≈øo it may make for his purpo≈øe; making the <hi>con≈øent</hi> of the people to ≈øignifie their <hi>power of Election</hi> in the making of Kings: though in the making of Bi≈øhops, by the peoples <hi>con≈øent,</hi> their <hi>approbation</hi> of a deed done by others mu≈øt onely be vnder≈øtood.

<note place="margin">2. King. 9.2, 3.</note> who vpon the Prophets priuat anointment of him, and that in mo≈øt ≈øecret manner, tooke pre≈øently the Kings office vpon him, without euer crauing any ≈øort of approbation from the people?</p>
            <p>And thus may ye now clearely ≈øee, how deepe the claime of the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Monarch toucheth vs in all our common intere≈øt: for (as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told) the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor any of his Va≈ø≈øals, I meane Church-men mu≈øt be ≈øubiect to no Kings nor Princes: and yet all Kings and their Va≈ø≈øals mu≈øt not onely be ≈øubiect to the Pope, but euen to their owne people.

<note place="margin">I≈øai 5.20.</note> and euill of good; which put light for darkene≈ø≈øe, and darkene≈øse for light;
<note place="margin">Ver≈øe 23.</note> which iu≈øtifie the wicked for are ward, and take away the righteou≈ønes of the righteous from him.</hi> For euen as in the time of the greate≈øt blindne≈ø≈øe in Popery, though a man ≈øhould find his wife or his daughter lying a bed in her Confe≈ø≈øors armes; yet was it not lawfull for him ≈øo much as to ≈øu≈øpect that the Frier had any errand there, but to Confe≈ø≈øe and in≈øtruct her: Euen ≈øo, though <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> practi≈øing in Trea≈øon be ≈øufficiently verified, and that them≈øelues cannot but confe≈ø≈øe it; yet mu≈øt they be accounted to ≈øuffer <hi>Martyrdome</hi> for the Faith, and their blood worke miracles, and frame a <hi>≈øtramineum argumentum</hi> vpon ≈øtrawes; when their heads are ≈øtanding aloft, withered by the Sunne and the winde, a publike ≈øpectacle for the eternall commemoration of their treacherie. Yea, one of the rea≈øons, that is giuen in the Printers Epi≈øtle of the <hi>Colonian</hi> edition of the Cardinall or his Chaplains pamphlet, why he doth the more willingly print it, is; becau≈øe that the innocencie of that mo≈øt holy and con≈øtant man <hi>Henry Garnet,</hi> is declared and ≈øet forth in that booke; again≈øt whom, ≈øome <hi>(he knew not who)</hi> had ≈øcattered a fal≈øe rumour of his guiltine≈ø≈øe of the Engli≈øh trea≈øon.</p>
            <p>But, Lord, what an impudencie or wilfull ignorance is this, that he, who was ≈øo publikely and ≈øolemnely conuicted and executed, vpon his owne ≈øo cleare, vnforced and often repeated confe≈ø≈øion, of his knowledge and concealing of that horrible Trea≈øon, ≈øhould now be ≈øaid to haue a certaine rumor ≈øpred vpon him of his guiltine≈ø≈øe, by <hi>I know not who?</hi> with ≈øo many
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:23110:189"/>attributes of godline≈ø≈øe, con≈øtancie and innocencie be≈øtowed vpon him, as if publike Sentences and Executions of Iu≈øtice, were rumors of <hi>I know not who.</hi> Indeed, I mu≈øt confe≈ø≈øe, the booke it ≈øelfe ≈øheweth a great affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to performe, what is thus promi≈øed in the Preface thereof: for in two or three places therein, is there mo≈øt honorable lying mention made of that ≈øtraw-Saint; wherein, though he confe≈ø≈øe that <hi>Garnet</hi> was vpon the foreknowledge of the Powder-Trea≈øon, yet in regard it was (as he ≈øaith) onely vnder the Seale of Confe≈ø≈øion, he ≈øticketh not to prai≈øe him for his concealing thereof, and would gladly giue him the crowne of glory for the ≈øame: not being a≈øhamed to proclaime it as a principall head of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique doctrine; <hi>That the ≈øecret of Sacramentall confe≈øsion ought not to be reuealed, not for the e≈øchewing of what≈øoeuer euill.</hi> But how damnable this doctrine is, and how dangerou≈øly preiudiciall to all Princes and States; I leaue it to you to iudge, whom all it mo≈øt highly concerneth. For although it bee trew, that when the Schoolemen came to be Doctors in the Church, and to marre the old grounds in Diuinitie by ≈øowing in among them their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophicall di≈øtinctions; though they (I ≈øay) do maintaine, That what≈øoeuer thing is told a Confe≈ø≈øor vnder the vaile of confe≈ø≈øion, how dangerous ≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the matter be, yet he is bound to conceale the parties name: yet doe none of them, I meane of the old Schoolemen, deny; that if a matter be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto them, the concealing whereof may breed a great or publike danger; but that in that ca≈øe the Confe≈ø≈øor may di≈øclo≈øe the matter, though not the per≈øon, and by ≈øome indirect means make it come to light, that the danger thereof may be preuented. But that no trea≈øon nor deuili≈øh plot, though it ≈øhould tend to the ruine or exterminion of a whole Kingdome, mu≈øt be reuealed, if it be told vnder Confe≈ø≈øion, no not the matter ≈øo farre indirectly di≈øclo≈øed, as may giue occa≈øion for preuenting the danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: though it agree with the conceit of ≈øome three or foure new <hi>Ie≈øuited</hi> Doctors, it is ≈øuch a new and dangerous head of doctrine, as no King nor State can liue in ≈øecuritie where that Po≈øition is maintained.</p>
            <p>And now, that I may as well prooue him a lyar <hi>in facto,</hi> in his narration of this particular Hi≈øtory; as I haue ≈øhewed him to be <hi>in iure,</hi> by this his damnable and fal≈øe ground in Diuinity: I will trewly informe you of <hi>Garnets</hi> ca≈øe, which is farre otherwi≈øe then this An≈øwerer alleadgeth. For fir≈øt, it can neuer be accounted a thing vnder Confe≈ø≈øion, which he that reueals it doth not di≈øcouer with a remor≈øe, accounting it a ≈øinne whereof hee repenteth him; but by the contrary, di≈øcouers it as a good motion, and is therein not di≈ø≈øuaded by his Confe≈ø≈øor, nor any penance enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him for the ≈øame: and in this forme was this Trea≈øon reuealed to <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> as him≈øelfe confe≈ø≈øed. And next, though he ≈øtood long vpon it, that it was reuealed vnto him vnder the vaile of Confe≈ø≈øion, in re≈øpect it was done in that time, while as the partie was making his Confe≈ø≈øion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; Yet at the la≈øt hee did freely confe≈ø≈øe, that the party reuealed it vnto him as they were walking, and not in the time of Confe≈ø≈øion: But
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:23110:189"/>(he ≈øaid) he deliuered it vnto him vnder the greate≈øt Seale that might bee, and ≈øo he tooke that he meant by the Seale of Confe≈ø≈øion; And it had (as he thought) a relation to Confe≈ø≈øion, in regard that hee was that parties Confe≈ø≈øor, and had taken his Confe≈ø≈øion ≈øometimes before, and was to take it againe within few dayes thereafter. He al≈øo ≈øaid, that he pretended to the partie, that he would not conceale it from his Superior. And further it is to be noted, that he confe≈ø≈øed, that two diuers per≈øons conferred with him anent this Trea≈øon; and that when the one of them which was <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesby,</hi> conferred with him thereupon, it was in the other parties pre≈øence and hearing: and what a Confe≈ø≈øion can this be in the hearing of a third per≈øon? And how farre his la≈øt words (whereof our An≈øwerer ≈øo much vaunts him) did di≈øproue it to haue bene vnder Confe≈ø≈øion, the Earle of Northamptons booke doeth beare witne≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>Now as to the other parties name, that reuealed the Powder-Trea≈øon vnto him, it was <hi>Greenewell</hi> the <hi>Ie≈øuite;</hi> and ≈øo a <hi>Ie≈øuite</hi> reuealed to a <hi>Ie≈øuite</hi> this Trea≈øonable plot, the <hi>Ie≈øuite</hi> reuealer not ≈øhewing any remor≈øe, and the <hi>Ie≈øuite</hi> whom-to it was reuealed not ≈øo much as enioyning him any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the ≈øame. And that ye may know that more <hi>Ie≈øuits</hi> were al≈øo vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the partie, <hi>Owldcorne</hi> the other Powder-Martyr, after the mi≈øgiuing and di≈øcouery of that Trea≈øon, preached con≈øolatory doctrine to his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique auditorie; exhorting them not to faint for the mi≈øgiuing of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpri≈øe, nor to thinke the wor≈øe thereof that it ≈øucceeded not; alleadging diuers Pre≈øidents of ≈øuch godly enterpri≈øes that mi≈øgaue in like maner: e≈øpecially, one of <hi>S. Lewes</hi> King of France, who in his ≈øecond iourney to the <hi>Holy-land</hi> died by the way, the greate≈øt part of his armie being de≈øtroyed by the plague; his fir≈øt iourney hauing likewi≈øe mi≈øgiuen him by the <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans</hi> taking of him: exhorting them thereupon not to giue ouer, but ≈øtill to hope that GOD would ble≈ø≈øe their enterpri≈øe at ≈øome other time, though this did faile.</p>
            <p>Thus ≈øee ye now, with what boldne≈ø≈øe and impudencie hee hath belied the publiquely knowne veritie in this errand; both in auowing generally that no <hi>Ie≈øuite</hi> was any wayes guiltie of that Trea≈øon, for ≈øo he affirmeth in his booke; and al≈øo that <hi>Garnet</hi> knew nothing thereof, but vnder the Seale of Confe≈ø≈øion. But if this were the fir≈øt lye of the affaires of this State, which my fugitiue Prie≈øts and Ie≈øuits haue coyned and ≈øpread abroad, I could charme them of it, as the prouerbe is. But as well the walles of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Mona≈øteries and <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> Colledges abroad, are filled with the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ≈øuch lying Hi≈øtories, as al≈øo the bookes of our ≈øaid fugitiues are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with ≈øuch ≈øort of ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe ≈øtuffe; ≈øuch are the innumerable ≈øorts of torments and cruell deathes, that they record their Martyrs to haue ≈øuffred here, ≈øome torne at foure Hor≈øes; ≈øome ≈øowed in Beares skinnes, and then killed with Dogges; nay, women haue not bene ≈øpared (they ≈øay) and a thou≈øand other ≈øtrange fictions; the vanities of all which I will in two words di≈øcouer vnto you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:23110:190"/>Fir≈øt, as for the cau≈øe of their puni≈øhment, I doe con≈øtantly maintaine that which I haue ≈øaid in my <hi>Apologie:</hi> That no man, either in my time, or in the late <hi>Queenes,</hi> euer died here for his con≈øcience. For let him be neuer ≈øo deuout a Papi≈øt, nay, though he profe≈ø≈øe the ≈øame neuer ≈øo con≈øtantly, his life is in no danger by the Law, if hee breake not out into ≈øome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acte expre≈øly again≈øt the words of the Law; or plot not ≈øome vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or dangerous practi≈øe or attempt; Prie≈øts and Popi≈øh Church-men onely excepted, that receiue Orders beyond the Seas; who for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold trea≈øonable practi≈øes that they haue kindled and plotted in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, are di≈øcharged to come home againe vnder paine of Trea≈øon, after their receiuing of the ≈øaid Orders abroad; and yet, without ≈øome other guilt in them then their bare home-comming, haue none of them bene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer put to death. And next, for the cruell torments and ≈øtrange ≈øorts of death that they ≈øay ≈øo many of them haue bene put vnto; if there were no more but the Law and continually ob≈øerued cu≈øtome of England, the≈øe many hundred yeeres, in all criminall matters, it will ≈øufficiently ≈øerue to refute all the≈øe mon≈øtrous lies: for no tortures are euer v≈øed here, but the Manacles or the Racke, and the≈øe neuer but in ca≈øes of high Trea≈øon; and all ≈øorts of Traitours die but one maner of death here, whether they be Papi≈øt or Prote≈øtant Traitors; Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time onely excepted. For then indeede no ≈øorts of cruell deathes were ≈øpared vnexecuted vpon men, women and children profe≈ø≈øing our Religion: yea, euen again≈øt the Lawes of God and Nature, women with childe were put to cruell death for their profe≈ø≈øion; and a liuing childe falling out of the mothers belly, was throwen in the ≈øame fire againe that con≈øumed the mother. But the≈øe tyrannous per≈øecutions were done by the Bi≈øhops of that time, vnder the warrant of the Popes authoritie; and therefore were not ≈øubiect to that con≈øtant order and formes of execution, which as they are heere e≈øtabli≈øhed by our Lawes and cu≈øtomes, ≈øo are they accordingly ob≈øerued in the puni≈øhment of all criminals: For all Prie≈øtes and Popi≈øh Traitours here receiue their Iudgements in the temporall Courts, and ≈øo doe neuer exceed tho≈øe formes of execution which are pre≈øcribed by the Law, or approued by continuall cu≈øtome. One thing is al≈øo to bee marked in this ca≈øe that ≈øtrangers are neuer called in que≈øtion here for their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is farre otherwi≈øe (I hope) in any place where the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition</hi> domines.</p>
            <p>But hauing now too much wearied you with this long di≈øcour≈øe, whereby I haue made you plainely ≈øee, that the wrong done vnto mee in particular fir≈øt by the <hi>Popes Breues,</hi> and then by the≈øe Libellers, doth as deepely intere≈øt you all in generall, that are <hi>Kings,</hi> free <hi>Princes,</hi> or <hi>States</hi> as it doth me in particular: I will now conclude, with my humble prayers to God, that he will waken vs vp all out of that Lethargike ≈ølumber of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, wherein our Predece≈ø≈øors and wee haue lien ≈øo long; and that wee may fir≈øt grauely con≈øider, what we are bound in con≈øcience to doe for the

And next, that we may prouidently looke to the ≈øecuritie of our owne States, and not ≈øuffer this incroching <hi>Babylonian Monarch</hi> to winne ≈øtill ground vpon vs. And if GOD hath ≈øo mercifully dealt with vs, that are his Lieutenants vpon earth, as that he hath ioyned his cau≈øe with our intere≈øt, the ≈øpirituall libertie of the Go≈øpell with our temporall freedome: with what zeale and courage may wee then imbrace this worke: for our labours herein being a≈ø≈øured, to receiue at the la≈øt the eternall and ine≈øtimable reward of felicitie in the kingdome of Heauen; and in the meane time to procure vnto our ≈øelues a temporall ≈øecuritie, in our temporall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in this world.</p>
            <p>As for ≈øo many of you as are alreadie per≈øwaded of that Trewth which I profe≈ø≈øe, though differing among your ≈øelues in ≈øome particular points; I thinke little per≈øwa≈øion ≈øhould moue you to this holy and wi≈øe Re≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Our Greatne≈ø≈øe, nor our number, prai≈øed bee GOD, being not ≈øo contemptible, but that wee may ≈øhew good example to our neighbors; ≈øince almo≈øt the halfe of all Chri≈øtian people and of all ≈øorts and degrees, are of our profe≈ø≈øion; I meane, all gone out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> euen from Kings and free Princes, to the meane≈øt ≈øort of People.

<note place="margin">Actes. 26.29.</note> and with <hi>S. Paul</hi> I wi≈øh, that ye were as I am in this ca≈øe; e≈øpecially that yee would ≈øearch the Scriptures, and ground your Faith vpon your owne certaine knowledge, and not vpon the report of others;

                     <p>Hauing vnderstood by your an≈øwere to that Propo≈øition which was made vnto you in our name by our Amba≈ø≈øadour there re≈øident, That at your A≈øsembly to bee holden in Nouember next, you are re≈øolued then to giue order concerning the bu≈øine≈øse of that wretched<hi> D. Vor≈øtius, </hi>Wee haue thought good (notwith≈øtanding the declaration which our Amba≈ø≈øadour hath already made vnto you in our name touching that particular,) to put you againe in remembrance thereof by this Letter, and thereby freely to di≈øcharge our ≈øelues, both in point of our duetie towards God, and of that ≈øincere friend≈øhip which wee beare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you.</p>
                     <p>Fir≈øt We a≈ø≈øure Our ≈øelues that you are ≈øufficiently per≈øwaded that no worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect could moue Vs to haue thus importuned you in an affaire of this nature, being drawen into it onely through Our zeale to the glory of God, and the care which Wee haue that all occa≈øion of ≈øuch great ≈øcandals as this is, vnto the trew reformed Church
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:23110:199"/>of God, might bee in due time fore≈øeene and preuented. Wee are therefore to let you vnder≈øtand, that Wee doe not a little wonder, that you haue not onely ≈øought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide an habitation in ≈øo eminent a place among≈øt you, for ≈øuch a corrupted per≈øon as this<hi> Vor≈øtius </hi>is, but that you haue al≈øo afforded him your licen≈øe and protection to print that Apologie which he hath dedicated vnto you; A booke wherein he doeth mo≈øt impudently maintaine the execrable blasphemies, which in his former hee had di≈øgorged; The which wee are now able to affirme out of our owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, hauing ≈øince that Letter which wee wrote vnto our Amba≈øsadour, read ouer and ouer againe with our owne eyes (not without extreme mi≈ølike and horrour) both his bookes, the first dedicated to the Lantgraue of<hi> He≈ø≈øen, </hi>and the other to you. We had well hoped, that the corrupt ≈øeed which that enemie of God<hi> Arminius </hi>did ≈øowe among≈øt you ≈øome few yeeres ≈øince (who≈øe di≈øciples and followers are yet too bold and frequent within your Dominions) had giuen you a ≈øufficient warning, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to take heed of ≈øuch infected per≈øons, ≈øeeing your owne Countrey men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diuided into Factions vpon this occa≈øion, a matter ≈øo oppo≈øite to vnitie (which is indeed the onely prop and ≈øafetie of your State next vnder God) as of nece≈øsitie it mu≈øt by little and little bring you to vtter ruine, if wi≈øely you doe not prouide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and that in time.</p>
                     <p>It is trew that it was Our hard hap not to heare of this<hi> Arminius </hi>before he was dead, and that all the Reformed Churches of<hi> Germanie </hi>had with open mouth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of him. But a≈øsoone as Wee vnder≈øtood of that di≈øtraction in your State, which after his death he left behind him, We did not faile (taking the opportunitie when your la≈øt extraordinary Amba≈ø≈øadors were here with Vs) to v≈øe ≈øome ≈øuch ≈øpeeches vnto them concerning this matter, as We thought fitte≈øt for the good of your State, and which we doubt not but they haue faithfully reported vnto you; For what need We make any que≈øtion of the arrogancie of the≈øe Heretiques, or rather Athei≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Sectaries amongst you, when one of them at this pre≈øent remaining in your towne of<hi> Leyden, </hi>hath not onely pre≈øumed to publi≈øh of late a bla≈øphemous Booke of the Apo≈øta≈øie of the Saints, but hath be≈øides beene ≈øo impudent, as to ≈øend the other day a copie thereof, as a goodly pre≈øent, to Our Arch-Bi≈øhop of<hi> Canterbury, </hi>together with a letter, wherein he is not a≈øhamed (as al≈øo in his Booke) to lie ≈øo gro≈øsely, as to auowe, that his Here≈øies conteined in the ≈øaid Booke, are agreeable with the Religion and profe≈øsion of Our Church of<hi> England. </hi>For the≈øe re≈øpects therefore haue Wee cau≈øe enough very heartily to reque≈øt you, to roote out with ≈øpeed tho≈øe Here≈øies and Schi≈ømes, which are beginning to bud foorth amongst you, which if you ≈øuffer to haue the reines any longer, you cannot expect any other i≈ø≈øue thereof, then the cur≈øe of God, infamy throughout all the reformed Churches, and a perpetuall rent and di≈øtraction in the whole body of your State. But if peraduenture this wretched<hi> Vor≈øtius </hi>≈øhould denie or equiuocate vpon tho≈øe bla≈øphemous poynts of Here≈øie and Athei≈øme, which already hee hath broached, that perhaps may mooue you to ≈øpare his per≈øon, and not cau≈øe him to bee burned (which neuer any Heretique better de≈øerued, and wherein we will leaue him to your owne (bristian wi≈øedome) but to ≈øuffer him vpon any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or abnegation, which hee ≈øhall offer to make, ≈øtill to continue and to teach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt you, is a thing ≈øo abominable, as we a≈ø≈øure our ≈øelues it will not once enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any of your thoughts: For admit hee would proue him≈øelfe innocent (which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈ø≈øe
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:23110:200"/>he cannot doe) in mo≈øt of tho≈øe points wherewith hee is charged; yet were it but the ≈øcandall of his per≈øon, which will ≈øtill remaine, it were cau≈øe more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for you to remooue him out of your Dominions. You know what is written of<hi> Cae≈øars </hi>wife, that it was not ≈øufficient for her to be innocent, but ≈øhe mu≈øt al≈øo bee free from all occa≈øion of ≈øuspicion: how much more then ought you to bee warie and cautious in a matter of ≈øo great importance as this, which concerneth the glory of God, the ≈øaluation of your ≈øoules, the ≈øoules of your people, and the ≈øafetie of your State; and not to ≈øuffer ≈øo dangerous a ≈øparke to lie kindling amongst you? For a man may ea≈øily coniecture, that feare and the horrour of his owne actions will make him boldly denie that poy≈øon which boyleth at his heart: For what will not bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that denieth the Eternitie and Omnipotencie of God? And howbeit hee were innocent (as we haue ≈øaid before) the Church of God is not ≈øo ill furni≈øhed with men of ≈øufficiencie for that place, as that you need bee vnprouided of ≈øome other, who ≈øhall not be ≈øubiect to that ≈øcandall, wherewith hee is ≈øo tainted, as it must bee a long penance, and many yeeres of probation, that mu≈øt weare it away. But especially ought you to bee very carefull, not to hazard the corruption of your youth in ≈øo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous an Vniuer≈øitie by the doctrine of ≈øo ≈øcandalous a per≈øon, who (it is to bee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) when hee findeth him≈øelfe once well ≈øetled there, will returne againe to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient vomite.</p>
                     <p>We will therefore conclude with this request vnto you, that you will a≈øsure your ≈øelues, that the affection onely which wee beare vnto your State, hath enforced vs to v≈øe this libertie towards you, not doubting for our part, but that, as this which wee haue written vnto you proceedes from the ≈øinceritie of our con≈øcience, ≈øo our good God will bee plea≈øed to giue you a due apprehen≈øion thereof, and that your re≈øolution in a matter of ≈øo great con≈øequence, may tend to his glory, to your owne honour and ≈øafetie, to the extirpation of the≈øe ≈øpringing<hi> Athei≈ømes </hi>and<hi> Here≈øies, </hi>and to the ≈øatisfaction, not onely of vs, but of all the reformed Churches, who haue bene hitherto extremely ≈øcandalized therewith: But if on the contrary part, we faile of that wee expect at your hands (which God forbid) and that you ≈øuffer hereafter ≈øuch pe≈øtilent<hi> Heretiques </hi>to nestle among you, who dare take vpon them that licentious libertie, to fetch againe from Hell the ancient<hi> Here≈øies </hi>long ≈øince condemned, or el≈øe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent new of their owne braine, contrary to the beliefe of the trew Catholike Church, wee ≈øhall then bee con≈øtrained (to our great griefe) publikely to prote≈øt again≈øt the≈øe abominations: and (as God hath honoured vs with the Title of<hi> Defender of the Faith) </hi>not onely to depart and ≈øeparate our ≈øelues from the vnion of ≈øuch fal≈øe and heretical Churches, but al≈øo to exhort all other reformed Churches to ioyne with vs in a common Councel, how to extingui≈øh and remand to hell the≈øe abominable<hi> Here≈øies, </hi>that now newly begin to put foorth againe. And furthermore for our owne particular, we ≈øhall be enforced ≈øtrictly to inhibite the youth of our Dominions from repairing to ≈øo infected a place, as is the Vniuer≈øitie of<hi> Leyden. Sed meliora ≈øperamus &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minamur, </hi>We hope and expect for better, a≈ø≈øuring our ≈øelues in the mercie of our good God, that as he hath a long time pre≈øerued you from your temporall enemies, and at this time is beginning to e≈øtabli≈øh your E≈øtate to the contentment of all your friends, (but especially to ours, who haue neuer beene wanting to a≈øsi≈øt you vpon all occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that the ≈øame God will not leaue you for a prey to your ≈øpirituall aduer≈øaries,

                  <p>For, to beginne with the Preface of his Booke, intituled his <hi>Chri≈øtian and mode≈øt An≈øwere,</hi> he makes there ≈øo light reckoning of his que≈øtions before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, as if it were but about the tale of <hi>Tobies</hi> dogge. For in the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond page of his ≈øaid Preface, the≈øe be his wordes: <hi>Omnis homo e≈øt mendax, imm√≤ vanitate ip≈ø√¢ vanior, ≈øolus ver√≤ Deus e≈øt verax, &amp;c. Quod c√πm in omnibus magni momenti negotijs, tum maxim√® in ≈øancti≈øsim√¢ fidei cau≈ø√¢ humiliter nobis ≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per agno≈øcendum e≈øt: ne videlicet quidquam quod prim√¢ fronte nobis nouum, imm√≤ fal≈øum, &amp; ab≈øurdum videatur, facil√® damnemus, nec contra quicquid vulg√≤ recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum e≈øt, (in rebus prae≈øertim ab≈øtru≈øis ac perplexis, nec tamen ad ≈øalutem ≈øcitu nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rijs) &amp; quidem cum opinione praeci≈øae nece≈øsitatis, ≈øtatim approbemus.

                     <q>
                        <hi>dictorum mode≈øt√® reddere paratus ≈øit.</hi> That is to ≈øay, Euery man is a lyer, yea, more vaine then vanity it ≈øelfe, God onely is trew, &amp;c. Which ≈øeeing wee ought euer humbly to acknowledge in all great and weighty cau≈øes, mo≈øt of all ought we to confe≈ø≈øe it in the mo≈øt holy cau≈øe of our Faith: in≈øomuch as we ≈øhould not therefore ea≈øily condemne euery thing which at the fir≈øt ≈øeemes ≈øtrange, yea fal≈øe and ab≈øurd vnto our eares, nor on the contrary ≈øide, ought wee foorth-with to approoue, and that with an opinion of preci≈øe nece≈ø≈øitie, what≈øoeuer is commonly receyued, e≈øpecially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ab≈øtru≈øe and intricate, whereof the knowledge is not nece≈ø≈øarie to ≈øaluation. In ≈øuch poynts as the≈øe, if any man ≈øhall ≈øay, that ≈øuch a King, or Prince, how≈øoeuer otherwi≈øe mo≈øt godly and religious, yea that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ≈øuch Kings, and Princes (nay, I will not except Bi≈øhops, or the like Doctors of the Church) haue in ≈øome ≈øort erred, I am of opinion, hee ≈øhall not giue any iu≈øt cau≈øe of offence, either to the Maie≈øtie of Kings, or to the dignitie of Princes and Bi≈øhops, ≈øo as hee bee alwaies ready mode≈øtly to yeeld a rea≈øon for that which hee ≈øhall affirme.</q> In which words, hee maintaineth two Principles: Fir≈øt, that euery man is a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, a≈øwell in matter of Faith, as in any thing el≈øe; and next, that wee mu≈øt not euer e≈øteeme the vulgar opinion, and that which is generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in matter of Faith to be the trewe≈øt, nor alwayes condemne euery opinion for ab≈øurd, which at the fir≈øt ≈øeemes vnto vs vncouth, and new. Now we pray you ob≈øerue, that this man is not accu≈øed of ≈ømall ≈øcapes, and therefore beeing not charged with le≈ø≈øer <hi>peccadillos,</hi> then tho≈øe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee haue mentioned, it nece≈ø≈øarily followes, that in his excu≈øe hee mu≈øt vnder≈øtand the ≈øame points whereof he is accu≈øed. And wee hope by the mercy of GOD, that no Chri≈øtian (wee ≈øpeake in this particular, as well for the Papi≈øts, as for our ≈øelues) ≈øhall euer be found to erre in any of tho≈øe maine points: at the lea≈øt wee will an≈øwere, (by the grace of God,) for one of tho≈øe Kings whom he names in general. And as for his new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:23110:207"/>which he would ≈øo gladly vent abroad, the ancient Faith needes not be changed like an old garment, either in ≈øub≈øtance, or fa≈øhion.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, in the third page of his Preface, hee v≈øeth the≈øe words, <hi>Sed neque plures vno aliquo ≈øemper h√Æc ditiores ≈øunt. Nemo igitur vnus ≈øibi arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>omnia. Nec numero plures vni alicui, ≈øingulare quidquam inuideant.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are many men alwayes richer <hi>[in knowledge]</hi> then ≈øome one man. Let not therefore any one man arrogate all things to him≈øelfe. Nor let the greater multitude enuie a particular man,</q> for hauing ≈øome ≈øingularitie more then his fellowes. The trew principle and foundation of the error of the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> taking away by this meanes, all maner of gouernment from the Church: For hauing fir≈øt ouerthrowen the Monarchicall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Pope, he ≈øweepes away next all manner of power both Ari≈øtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall and Democraticall from the Church, cleane contrary to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles in≈øtitution, which ordeineth, that <hi>the ≈øpirits of the Prophets ≈øhould bee ≈øubiect to the Prophets.</hi> For if one particular man may take vpon him ≈øuch a ≈øingularitie as this, how ≈øhall he bee ≈øubiect to Generall, Nationall, and Synodicall Councels? For ≈øtraight will he ≈øay vnto them; Sirs, yee haue no authoritie to iudge mee, for I haue a ≈øingular gift aboue you all. And in the fift Page, the≈øe are his words: <hi>Plam≈øsim√® enim per≈øua≈øus ≈øum, Sereni≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øimo Regi nunquam in animo fui≈ø≈øe, nunquam in animo fore, alienae con≈øcientiae (quod ne Apostoli quidem ≈øibi vnquam arrog√¢runt) fiue direct√®, fiue indirect√®, ≈øiue per ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ip≈øum, ≈øiue per alios vllaten√πs dominari, vel fidem nostram vlli humanae authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>alligare velle.</hi> For I am ab≈øolutely per≈øwaded, that it was neuer his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie≈øties meaning, nor euer will bee, either directly, or indirectly, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, or by others, in any ≈øort to ouer-rule another mans con≈øcience, (which euen the Apo≈øtles neuer challenged to them≈øelues) nor did, or will his Maie≈øtie euer ≈øeeke to tie our Faith to any humane authoritie.</q> Whereby hee is plainely di≈øcouered, to bee re≈øolued not to bee ≈øubiect in any ≈øort to the iudgement of the Church, in tho≈øe matters whereof hee is accu≈øed. For hee knowes too well, that the ancient Church hath e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhed vpon nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequences drawen from the holy Scripture, both a forme of beliefe, and a forme of ≈øpeach concerning the holy My≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries afore≈øaid: And this is the rea≈øon why hee will not in the≈øe points ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him≈øelfe to the iudgement of any mortall man; But vpon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion in the ≈øeuenth page of his Preface, maintaines his Chri≈øtian libertie in this maner: <hi>Qui quidem humanas deci≈øiones √† Diuinis my≈øterijs ≈øcrupulo≈ø√© ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregem; &amp; prae≈øertim in audaces Scholarum hypothe≈øes, pro Christiana libertate</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>interdum diligenti√πs inquiram;</hi> I, who curiou≈øly make a ≈øeparation betwixt the iudgements of men and the Diuine my≈øteries, and e≈øpecially accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chri≈øtian libertie, doe ≈øometimes more narrowly looke into the bold ≈øupo≈øitions of the Schoolemen.</q> As if the Schoole Diuines had bene too ventrous, to explaine and to defend the Articles afore≈øaid, already ≈øo e≈øtabli≈øhed by the Church: But we may trewly wi≈øh in that point, as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> did touching <hi>Caluin: Vtinam ≈øemper ≈øic erra≈ø≈øent Scholastici;</hi> Would
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:23110:207"/>God the Scholemen had alwayes ≈øo erred: For in the maine grounds of Chri≈øtian Religion, they are worthy of all commendation. Reade <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> again≈øt the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But in matters of controuer≈øie, where they were to flatter the Pope in his re≈øolutions, and to auow the new ordinances and traditions of their Church, there they yeelded (alas) vnto the iniquitie of the time, and the my≈øterie of iniquitie, which was euen then in working, got likewi≈øe the vpper hand ouer them. And as for this Chri≈øtian libertie, which he doeth vrge ≈øo much, certainely he doeth it with no other inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but onely vnder this faire pretext, to haue the better meanes, and with more ≈øafetie to abu≈øe the world: For Chri≈øtian libertie is neuer meant in the holy Scripture, but onely in matters indifferent, or when it is taken for our deliuerance from the thraldome of the Law, or from the burden of humane traditions, and in that ≈øen≈øe <hi>S. Paul</hi> ≈øpeaketh in his Epi≈øtle to the <hi>Colo≈øsians, Quare oneraminiritibus?</hi> Why are ye burdened with traditions? But to abu≈øe Chri≈øtian libertie, in pre≈øuming to propound a new doctrine vnto the world, in point of the highe≈øt and holie≈øt my≈øteries of GOD, is a mo≈øt audacious ra≈øhne≈ø≈øe, and an impudent arrogancie: Concerning which <hi>S. Paul</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>Though an Angel from heauen, preach vnto you otherwi≈øe then that which we haue preached vnto you, let him bee accur≈øed.</hi> And <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> likewi≈øe commandeth vs, that wee ≈øhould not ≈øo much as ≈øay, <hi>God ≈øpeed</hi> to that man, which ≈øhall bring vs any other doctrine, as wee haue ob≈øerued before.</p>
                  <p>Now to ≈øhew that he is a forger of new opinions, by which he would faine make him≈øelfe ≈øingular, ≈øee but his wordes immediately preceding tho≈øe which a little before wee mentioned, where hee boa≈øteth, and is wonderfully in loue with a new name which he hath taken vpon him≈øelfe, that is to ≈øay, <hi>Purus putus Euangelicus,</hi> A mainly pure Go≈øpeller; although indeed the word <hi>pure</hi> was neuer yet taken in a good part. For among≈øt the ancient <hi>Heretiques,</hi> there was a Sect that called them≈øelues <hi>Catharoi,</hi> and there was al≈øo another Sect among the <hi>Anabapti≈øts,</hi> that were called <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes,</hi> from whence the <hi>Preci≈øians</hi> of our Kingdomes, who out of ≈øelfe-will and fancie refu≈øe to conforme them≈øelues to the Orders of our Church, haue borrowed their name. And for the word <hi>Go≈øpeller,</hi> although it hath bene a≈ø≈øumed in diuers places by ≈øome of our Religion, yet hath it this ill fortune, that it is more v≈øually receiued in tho≈øe parts of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heme,</hi> where there are ≈øuch infinite diuer≈øities of Sects (agreeing in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but in their Vnion again≈øt the <hi>Pope</hi>) then in any other place. The holy Scripture it ≈øelfe in the <hi>Actes of the Apo≈øtles,</hi> mentioneth the name of <hi>Christians:</hi> and the ancient <hi>Primitiue</hi> Church did attribute vnto the faithfull, the names of <hi>Catholique</hi> and <hi>Orthodox.</hi> So as for ≈øuch a fellow as <hi>Vor≈øtius,</hi> to affect new Titles for his Religion, it hath ≈øurely no good reli≈øh: his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without doubt being no other, then by this meanes to make a di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and in time a rupture betwixt him≈øelfe, and the <hi>Orthodox</hi> profe≈ø≈øors of our Religion. And for proofe that hee is ≈øtedfa≈øtly re≈øolued to per≈øi≈øt
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:23110:208"/>in all the≈øe nouelties, and not to retract any thing of that which he hath written, ≈øee what hee ≈øaith in the la≈øt page ≈øaue one of his ≈øaid Preface. <hi>Opinor enim ip≈øe (vt magni illius Era≈ømi verba h√¨c aemuler) in libris meis nihil repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riri, quo deterior qui≈øpiam reddi po≈øsit.</hi> For I am of opinion (to v≈øe the words of that great <hi>Era≈ømus</hi>) that there is nothing to be found in my Bookes, that can make any man the wor≈øe that reads them.</p>
                  <p>As for his Booke which followes this Preface, it verifies the Prouerbe, <hi>Dignum patell√† operculum,</hi> A couer fit for ≈øuch a di≈øh. For it is ≈øo full of di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and ≈øophi≈øticall eua≈øions, ≈øo ≈øtuft with <hi>As it weres, in ≈øome ≈øorts, in my ≈øence,</hi> and ≈øuch words as the≈øe, as euen in that poynt hee hath al≈øo a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> But God is <hi>Vnity</hi> it ≈øelfe, and <hi>Veritie</hi> is <hi>One,</hi> and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and in our v≈øuall manner of ≈øpeech, we call it <hi>the ≈øimple Verity,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was it yet called, <hi>the double veritie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee haue thought good to ≈øet downe here two places of his ≈øayd Booke, that thereby the Reader may iudge of the re≈øt; whereof one is in the twelfth page, in the≈øe words, <hi>Argumenta quae adferuntur √† Patribus, vel √† re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centioribus Theologis pro aeterna Christi generatione, aut fallacia ≈øunt, aut friuola.</hi> The arguments which are v≈øed both by the Fathers and by the moderne Diuines, for the eternall generation of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> are either ≈øophi≈øticall or fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous. The≈øe words (as he ≈øaith) he is charged to haue v≈øed, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bethinke him of any other eua≈øion, but to adde the word <hi>Quaedam,</hi> ≈øome arguments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now wee ≈øhall de≈øire thee (good Reader) here to ob≈øerue, that this man condemning ≈øome arguments which the Fathers had gathered out of the holy Scripture, to prooue the eternall generation of Chri≈øt, as deceitfull and friuolous, hee will bee ≈øure how≈øoeuer not to alleadge any other arguments, either out of the Fathers, or of his owne brayne, which ≈øhall be ≈øtronger then tho≈øe which he hath reiected. And in the ≈øame fa≈øhion he behaues him≈øelfe throughout his whole Booke: for we ≈øhew you this but for a ≈øcantling. In the other place, he directly denies, that euer he affirmed in his other Booke, that <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Desperation</hi> were incident to God: his wordes are the≈øe in the eighth page, <hi>Nam metum &amp; desperationem ne quidem vspi√†m nominaui.</hi> For I did neuer ≈øo much as name <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>De≈øperation,</hi> in any place. And yet neuerthele≈ø≈øe, let any man looke vpon his other Booke,

Herein hauing no other ≈øhift, he betakes him≈øelfe to an ab≈øolute and flat Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. But to the intent, that the Reader may iudge of his maner of ≈øpeaking through his whole la≈øt Booke intituled, <hi>A Chri≈øtian and mode≈øt An≈øwere,</hi> and how he playes the Sophi≈øter therein; we haue ≈øet downe diuers of his phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes (in manner of a Table) which we haue cau≈øed to be extracted out of his ≈øaid Booke.</p>

                     <p>Note here my mode≈øtie in this word <hi>[videntur]</hi> for in this place I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer onely a probable opinion, and not a dogmaticall a≈ø≈øertion.</p>

                  <p>By this may the Reader manife≈øtly di≈øcerne, that there is nothing which a man, ≈øpeaking in this fa≈øhion ≈øhall not be able to maintaine, and by this meanes ea≈øily prooue <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet.</hi> And certainely his manner of excu≈øes and eua≈øions are framed iu≈øt after the mould of the ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, and namely of <hi>Arrius,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Samo≈øatenus,</hi> when they ≈øaw them≈øelues pinched with the Arguments of the <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> Church, and had no power to re≈øi≈øt. The ≈øame al≈øo doeth more plainely appeare by an other little booke which he hath publi≈øhed, intituled, <hi>Theologicall po≈øitions,</hi> which booke he hath made of purpo≈øe to blinde the world withall; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they are indeed but the ≈øame <hi>The≈øes</hi> or <hi>Po≈øitions,</hi> vpon which he hath di≈øputed in his fir≈øt wicked booke, that beareth the title <hi>Of God and his Attributes.</hi> For in the <hi>The≈øes</hi> them≈øelues there is but little harme, but in his di≈øputations thereupon are couched all the horrible Here≈øies: And therefore in this booke hath hee publi≈øhed onely his <hi>The≈øes</hi> which are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtifiable; and left out his di≈øputations vpon the <hi>The≈øes,</hi> wherein all the poi≈øon is conteined. It is moreouer ≈øomewhat ≈øu≈øpicious in ≈øuch a tainted per≈øon as he is, that in an Appendix which hee hath placed at the end of his <hi>The≈øes,</hi> he taketh occa≈øion to name a number of Heretiques who are aduer≈øaries to the doctrine of his <hi>The≈øes,</hi> and tho≈øe e≈øpecially who haue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red concerning the Diuinitie, Humanitie, Per≈øon, or Office of CHRIST, as the <hi>Ebionites, Cerinthians, Arrians, Praxians, Sabellians, Marcionites, Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees, Docites, Apollinari≈øts, Mennonites, Swenkfeldians, Ne≈øtorians, Monothelites, Eutychians, Monophy≈øites, Iewes, Millenaries, Papi≈øts.</hi> Among≈øt which rabble he doeth not once make mention of <hi>Paulus Samo≈øatenus,</hi> nor of <hi>Photinius,</hi> who ≈øucceeded him as well in his Bi≈øhopricke as in his errour: Yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈ø≈øe it is reported, that <hi>Vor≈øtius</hi> in his heart is not very farre from their erronious opinion.</p>
                  <p>Now in the Preface of this little booke hee hath taken vpon him very ≈øuccinctly to make an≈øwere to fiue Articles which he confe≈ø≈øeth were layd to his charge, by which an≈øwere, in our opinion, hee di≈øcouers him≈øelfe very plainely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="377" facs="tcp:23110:210"/>The fir≈øt point is, That hee was once accu≈øed (as him≈øelfe ≈øaith) of the <hi>Samo≈øatenian</hi> Here≈øie, becau≈øe he had ≈øometime both written and receiued letters from diuers of that Sect; which he confe≈ø≈øeth he did indeed in his youth, to this end, that by that meanes hee might the more ea≈øily come by ≈øome of their bookes, but that afterward hee did forbeare all corre≈øpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie with them. Fir≈øt of all then, we would be glad to know why hee forgot the Here≈øie of <hi>Samo≈øatenus</hi> in his <hi>Appendix,</hi> where he names ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, and yet confe≈ø≈øeth in the Preface of his ≈øaid booke, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe was accu≈øed of that errour. Secondly, to what end had hee in his youth ≈øo great traffique with the≈øe Heretiques? was it to enable him the better to confute them? We heare him not ≈øay ≈øo much, as indeed it was neuer his end. Surely this fellow would be an excellent clean≈øer of a Pe≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hou≈øe, for he feares no infection: <hi>Picem contrectare non timet,</hi> he dares han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle any pitch: And yet for all that, the Prouerbe is trew, <hi>Qui ambulat in Sole, colorabitur;</hi> He that walketh in the Sun-≈øhine, ≈øhall bee Sun-burnt. It followes then, ≈øeeing his intention was not to arme him≈øelfe again≈øt them, that it mu≈øt be of nece≈ø≈øitie to make him≈øelfe worthy of their Schoole, the which hee almo≈øt confe≈ø≈øeth in the la≈øt words of his An≈øwere to that point, where he ≈øaith thus; <hi>Non enim (quod multi ≈øolent) alienis ≈øen≈øibus h√Æc fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum putaui, aut temer√® quidquam in cau≈øa Fidei damnandum:</hi> For I doe not thinke it fit (as many others doe) to relie in the≈øe ca≈øes vpon other mens con≈øtructions, or ra≈øhly to condemne any thing which concernes matter of Faith.</p>
                  <p>To the ≈øecond Article of his Accu≈øation, hee confe≈ø≈øeth that hee gaue ≈øome of his <hi>Samo≈øatenian</hi> bookes vnto his ≈øchollers; Surely, a goodly gift: But the caution was prettie which he gaue withall vnto them when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered them the bookes; which was that they ought to reade them with iudgement, not ra≈øhly reiecting the doctrine commonly receiued. What an Epithite is heere for our holy <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> Faith, to terme it no otherwi≈øe then the doctrine commonly receiued? And as for his caution, not ra≈øhly to for≈øake the old doctrine, it is no more then the Turkes would giue vnto any Chri≈øtian, that ≈øhould ≈øuddenly offer to become a Mahometi≈øt. Nay what Chri≈øtian did euer ≈øollicite a Pagan, or Heretique to bee conuerted, but with this caution? Who Would per≈øwade a man to receiue the holy Sacrament ra≈øhly? S. <hi>Paul</hi> commands euery man to examine him≈øelfe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, before hee come to that holy Table. But on the other ≈øide, an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe</hi> 
                     <q>Chri≈øtian would in this ca≈øe haue ≈øaid to his ≈øchollers: If you will reade the≈øe wicked bookes, reade them with horrour and dete≈øtation, and with an intent to arme your ≈øelues again≈øt ≈øuch wiles and ≈øubtilties of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and withall pray vnto GOD to keepe you con≈øtant in the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique and <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> Faith, that the≈øe Here≈øies may haue no power once to mooue you, tru≈øting in his mercy, and not in your owne ≈øtrength.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the third Article, he confe≈ø≈øeth that his ≈øchollers did publi≈øh bookes of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Here≈øie; and his excu≈øe is, that it was without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:23110:211"/>But how≈øoeuer, he condemnes them not for hauing done it onely this he ≈øaith, That they declared vpon their oathes, they did not fauour the Here≈øie.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth point, he confe≈ø≈øeth that about ten yeeres ≈øince, he wrote a booke <hi>De Filiatione Chri≈øti,</hi> (for which Title onely, an Authour, ≈øo ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as he, is worthy of the fagot,) and all his excu≈øe is, That he wrote an Epitome vpon <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Wee doubt not but hee did it for his recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For≈øooth, a prety conceit. Yet it appeares not by his wordes, that he dete≈øts the ≈øubiect of that Booke: but ≈øaith, That no man can thereby coniecture what his opinion is of that argument, no more then they can vpon his Epitome of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which was likewi≈øe his worke. For to condemne it, had beene contrary to that which hee auowed in his other booke, neuer to repent him≈øelfe of any thing that he hath once written, as already we haue ob≈øerued.</p>
                  <p>As for the fift and la≈øt point, he will neither confe≈ø≈øe, nor deny the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation: onely hee ≈øaith, That a certaine booke intituled <hi>Dominicus Lopez,</hi> which is (as we haue heard) a very bla≈øphemous Treati≈øe, was ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed by him <hi>pacis erg√≤,</hi> for peace ≈øake; but he is ≈øo farre from condemning it, as that he alleadgeth, the booke hath bene maintained by others, which in time ≈øhall appeare. Two things are here to bee ob≈øerued; Fir≈øt, that hee ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed it <hi>pacis erg√≤,</hi> for quietne≈ø≈øe ≈øake; Not therefore for the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of the ≈øubiect, The next, that in his due time: the trewth thereof ≈øhall appeare. In which la≈øt point onely, we will willingly ioyne with him, be≈øeeching our good GOD, for his CHRISTS ≈øake, that hee will bee plea≈øed to di≈øcouer the trewth of this mans intentions, as well for his owne Glory, as to purge the ≈øcandall, and to auoyd the danger which may en≈øue vnto Chri≈øtendome, by the darnell of Here≈øies which he hath ≈øowne.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore to bee noted, That to all the≈øe fiue Articles his an≈øweres are ≈øo ≈øilly and weake, as in three of them we haue found him <hi>plan√® confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentem reum,</hi> plainely pleading guiltie; blanching it onely with ≈øome poore excu≈øes. And to the other two points his an≈øwers are doubtfull; yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condemning the act of his ≈øchollers, nor the la≈øt wicked booke called <hi>Dominicus Lopez.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hauing now therefore briefly laied open the ≈øubtilties, friuolous di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and excu≈øes of the ≈øaid <hi>Vor≈øtius,</hi> we will conclude this point with this prote≈øtation; That if he had bene our owne Subiect, we would haue bid him <hi>Excrea,</hi> ≈øpit out: and forced him to haue produced, and confe≈ø≈øed tho≈øe wicked Here≈øies, that are rooted in his heart. And in ca≈øe he ≈øhould ≈øtand vpon his Negatiue, we would enioyne him to ≈øay (according to the ancient cu≈øtome of the Primitiue Church in the like ca≈øes of Heretiques) <hi>I renounce and from my ≈øoule detest them: Anathema, Maranatha</hi> vpon ≈øuch and ≈øuch Here≈øies; And not to ≈øay <hi>For peace ≈øake I cau≈øed this booke to be ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed, And the≈øe bookes are to bee read with great iudgement and di≈øcretion. S. Hierome</hi> liketh not that any man ≈øhould take it patiently, to be ≈øu≈øpected of Here≈øie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="379" facs="tcp:23110:211"/>And now to make an end of this Di≈øcour≈øe, we doe very heartily de≈øire all good Chri≈øtians in generall, and My Lords the States in particular (to whom the managing of this affaire doeth mo≈øt ≈øpecially belong) to con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but two things: Fir≈øt what kinde of people they be that ≈ølander vs, and our ≈øincere intention in this cau≈øe: And next, what priuate intere≈øt wee can po≈ø≈øibly haue (in re≈øpect of any worldly honour or aduancement) here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to engage our ≈øelues in ≈øuch ≈øort as we haue done.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the fir≈øt point, There are but three ≈øorts of people, that ≈øeeke to calumniate vs vpon this occa≈øion: That is to ≈øay; either ≈øuch as are infected with the ≈øame, or the like Here≈øies, wherewith <hi>Vor≈øtius</hi> is tainted, <hi>&amp; ideo fouent con≈øimilem cau≈øam,</hi> and therefore doe maintaine the like cau≈øe: or el≈øe ≈øuch as be of the Romane Religion, who in this confu≈øion, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of prophe≈øying would thru≈øt in for a part; conceiuing it more rea≈øona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that their doctrine ≈øhould be tolerated by tho≈øe of our Religion, then the doctrine of <hi>Vor≈øtius:</hi> or el≈øe ≈øuch, as for rea≈øon of State enuie peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the good amitie and corre≈øpondencie which is betwixt vs, and the Vnited Prouinces.</p>
                  <p>Touching our owne intere≈øt, the whole cour≈øe of our life doeth ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently witne≈ø≈øe, that we haue alwayes bene contented with that portion which GOD hath put into our hands, without ≈øeeking to inuade the po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øions of any other. Be≈øides, in two of our bookes, as well in our <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as in the Preface to our <hi>Apologie,</hi> we haue ≈øhewed the ≈øame inclination. For in the fir≈øt booke, ≈øpeaking of warre, we ≈øay that a King ought not to make any inua≈øion vpon anothers Dominions, vntill Iu≈øtice be fir≈øt denied him. And in the other booke, hauing ≈øhewed the v≈øurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pope, aboue all the Kings and Princes of Chri≈øtendome, our conclu≈øion is, that we will neuer goe about to per≈øwade them to a≈ø≈øault him within his Dominions, but onely to re≈øume, and pre≈øerue their owne iu≈øt Priuiledges from his violent intru≈øion. So as (thankes be to GOD) both our <hi>Theorique</hi> and <hi>Practique</hi> agree well together, to cleare vs from this vniu≈øt and ≈ølanderous imputation. And as for the States in particular, it is very vnlikely that we (who haue all our life time held ≈øo ≈øtrict an amitie with them, as for their defence wee haue bene contented to expo≈øe the liues of many of our Subiects of both Nations,) would now practi≈øe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt then State, and that vpon ≈øo poore a ≈øubiect as <hi>Vorstius:</hi> e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that ≈øo damnable a thing could euer enter into our heart, as vnder the vaile and pretext of the glory of GOD, to plot the aduancement of our owne priuate de≈øeignes.</p>
                  <p>The rea≈øons which induced vs to meddle in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared. We leaue it now to his owne proper Iudges to con≈øider what a nur≈øling they fo≈øter in their bo≈øome: A ≈øtranger, bred in the <hi>Socinian Here≈øie</hi> (as it is ≈øaid;) often times accu≈øed of <hi>Here≈øie</hi> by the Churches of <hi>Germanie;</hi> one that hath written ≈øo wicked and ≈øcandalous bookes; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and ≈øeriou≈øly prote≈øting in the preface of his <hi>Apologie</hi> to the States,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:23110:212"/>for the libertie of prophecying; and twice or thrice in≈øi≈øting vpon that libertie in the Preface of his <hi>Modest An≈øwere</hi> (a dangerous and pernitious libertie, or rather licentiou≈øne≈ø≈øe, opening a gap to all rupture, Schi≈øme, and confu≈øion in the Church;) yea hauing had ≈øome di≈øciples that be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques them≈øelues, and others that accu≈øe him of Here≈øie. And though there were no other cau≈øe then the ≈øilly and idle ≈øhifts wherewith hee ≈øeekes to defend him≈øelfe in his la≈øt bookes, it were enough to conuince him, either to haue maintained a bad cau≈øe, and in that re≈øpect worthy of a farre greater puni≈øhment then to be put by his place of <hi>Profe≈øsour;</hi> or at the lea≈øt to be a per≈øon vnworthy of the name of a <hi>Profe≈ø≈øour</hi> in ≈øo famous an Vniuer≈øitie, for hauing ≈øo weakely maintained a cau≈øe that is iu≈øt. For our part, GOD is our witne≈ø≈øe, we haue no quarrell again≈øt his per≈øon; he is a Stranger, borne farre from our dominions: he is a <hi>Germane,</hi> and it is well knowen, that all <hi>Germanie</hi> are our friends, and the mo≈øt part of the great Princes there, be either neerely allied vnto vs, or our Confederates: he doth outwardly profe≈ø≈øe the ≈øame Religion which we do: he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten again≈øt <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> and hath not mentioned vs, either in ≈øpeach or writing (for any thing we know) but with all the honour and re≈øpect that may be. GOD knowes, the wor≈øt that we do wi≈øh him is, that he may ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely returne into the high beaten path-way of the <hi>Catholique</hi> and <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall</hi> Faith.</p>
                  <p>And for my Lords the States (≈øeeing wee haue di≈øcharged our con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) we will now referre the managing of the whole Action vnto their owne di≈øcretions.

               <p>Now touching <hi>France,</hi> faire was the hope which J conceiued of the States a≈ø≈øembled in Parliament at <hi>Paris:</hi> That calling to minde the murthers of their Noble Kings, and the warres of the League which followed the Popes fulminations, as when a great ≈øtorme of haile powreth downe after a Thunder-cracke, and a world of writings addre≈ø≈øed to iustifie the parricides, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronings of kings, they would haue ioyned heads, hearts, &amp; hands together, to hammer out ≈øome apt and whole≈øome remedy against ≈øo many fearefull attempts and practi≈øes. To my hope was added no little ioy, when I was giuen to vnderstand the third <hi>E≈øtate</hi> had preferred an Article or Bill, the tenor and ≈øubstance whereof was concerning the meanes whereby the people might bee vnwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of this pernicious opinion; <hi>That Popes may to≈ø≈øe the French King his Throne like a tennis ball,</hi> and <hi>that killing of Kings is an acte meritorious to the purcha≈øe of the crowne of Martyrdome.</hi> But in fine, the proiect was encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with ≈øucce≈ø≈øe cleane coutrary to Expectation. For this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the third Estate, like a ≈øigh of libertie breathing her la≈øt,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:23110:213"/>≈øerued onely ≈øo much the more to inthrall the Crowne, and to make the bondage more grieuous and ≈øen≈øible then before.

The ≈øaid Oration was not onely Printed <hi>with the Kings priuiledge,</hi> but was likewi≈øe addre≈ø≈øed to mee by the Author and Orator him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe; who pre≈øuppo≈øed the reading thereof would for≈øooth driue me to ≈øay, <hi>Lord Cardinall, in this high ≈øubiect your Honour hath ≈øatisfied me to the full.</hi> All this poy≈øed in the ballance of equall iudgement, why may not J trewly and freely affirme, the ≈øaid E≈øtates a≈ø≈øembled in Parliament, haue ≈øet Royall Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtie vpon a doubtfull chance, or left it re≈øting vpon vncertaine tearmes: and that now if the doctrine there maintained by the Clergie ≈øhould beare any pawme, it may lawfully be doubted, who is King in <hi>France?</hi> For I make no que≈øtion, hee is but a titular King that raigneth onely at an others di≈øcretion, and who≈øe Princely head the Pope hath power to bare of his Regall Crowne.
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:23110:214"/>In temporall matters, how can one be Soueraigne, that may be flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of all his Temporalties by any ≈øuperiour power?

               <p>But by the vehement instance and ≈øtrong current of the Clergie and Nobles, this was borne downe as a pernicious Article, as a cau≈øe of Schi≈øme, as a gate which openeth to all ≈øorts of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies: yea, there it was maintained tooth and naile, that in ca≈øe the doctrine of this Article might goe for currant doctrine, it mu≈øt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that for many aages pa≈øt in ≈øequence, the Church hath beene the kingdome of Antichrist, and the ≈øynagogue of Satan. The Pope vpon ≈øo good i≈ø≈øue of the cau≈øe, had rea≈øon, J trow, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre≈ø≈øe his Letters of triumph vnto the Nobilitie and Clergie, who had ≈øo farre aprrooued them≈øelues faithfull to his Holine≈ø≈øe; and to vaunt withall, that hee had nipped Christian Kings in the Crowne, that hee had giuen them checke with mate, through the magnanimous re≈øolution of this courageous Nobilitie, by who≈øe braue making head, the third Estate had beene ≈øo valiantly forced to giue ground. Jn a ≈øcornefull reproach hee qualified the Deputies of the third Estate,
<note place="margin">I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aduerti≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers parts, that in the Popes letters to the Nobitie the≈øe wordes were extant, how≈øoeuer they haue bin left out in the impre≈ø≈øion, &amp; ra≈øed out of the copies of the ≈øaid let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note>

For the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie denie them≈øelues to haue any ranke among the Subiects of the King: they ≈øtand for a Soueraigne out of the Kingdome, to whom as to the Lord Paramount they owe ≈øuite and ≈øeruice: they are bound to aduance that Monarchie, to the bodie whereof they properly apperteine as parts or members, as el≈øewhere I haue
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:23110:214"/>written more at large. But for the Nobilitie, the Kings right arme, to prostitute and ≈øet as it were to ≈øale the dignitie of their King, as if the arme ≈øhould giue a thru≈øt vnto the head; J ≈øay for the Nobilitie to hold and maintaine euen in Parliament, their King is liable to depo≈øition by any forreine power or Potentate, may it not pa≈øse among the ≈øtrange≈øt miracles and rare≈øt wonders of the world? For that once granted, this con≈øequence is good and nece≈ø≈øarie; That in ca≈øe the King, once lawfully depo≈øed, ≈øhall ≈øtand vpon the defen≈øiue, and hold out for his right, he may then lawfully be murthered. Let mee then here freely profe≈ø≈øe my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and this it is: That now the French Nobilitie may ≈øeeme to haue ≈øome rea≈øon to di≈ørobe them≈øelues of their titles, and to transferre them by re≈øignation vnto the third E≈øtate. For that body of that third E≈øtate alone hath caried a right noble heart: in as much as the could neither be tickled with promi≈øes, nor ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by threatnings, from re≈øolute ≈øtanding to tho≈øe fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall points and rea≈øons of State, which mo≈øt concerne the honour of their King, and the ≈øecuritie of his per≈øon.</p>
               <p>Of all the Clergie, the man that hath most abandoned, or ≈øet his honour to ≈øale, the man to whom France is least obliged, is the <hi>Lord Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Perron:</hi> a man otherwi≈øe inferiour to few in matter of learning, and in the grace of a ≈øweete ≈øtyle. This man in two ≈øeuerall Orations, whereof the one was pronounced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Nobilitie, the other had audience before the third E≈øtate, hath ≈øet his best wits on worke, to draw that doctrine into all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and infamie, which teacheth Kings to be indepo≈øeable by the Pope. To this purpo≈øe hee termes the ≈øame doctrine, a breeder of Schi≈ømes, a gate that openeth to make way, and to giue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance vnto all here≈øies; in briefe, a doctrine to bee held in ≈øo high a degree of dete≈øtation, that rather then he and his fellow-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops will yeeld to the ≈øigning thereof, they will bee contented like Martyrs to burne at a ≈øtake. At which re≈øolution, or ob≈øtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie rather in his opinion, I am in a manner ama≈øed, more then I can be mooued for the like <hi>brauado</hi> in many other: fora≈ømuch as hee was many yeeres together, a follower of the late King, euen when
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:23110:215"/>the King followed a contrary Religion, and was depo≈øed by the Pope: as al≈øo becau≈øe not long before, in a certaine A≈ø≈øemblie hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at the Iacobins in Paris, hee with≈øtood the Popes Nuntio to his face, when the ≈øaid Nuntio laboured to make this doctrine, touching the Popes temporall Soueraigntie, pa≈ø≈øe for an Article of Faith. But in both Orations, hee ≈øingeth a contrary ≈øong, and from his owne mouth pa≈øseth ≈øentence of condemnation again≈øt his former cour≈øe and profe≈øsion. J fuppo≈øe, not without ≈øollide iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; as one that heerein hath well accommodated him≈øelfe to the times: For as in the reigne of the late King, hee durst not offer to broach this doctrine (≈øuch was his fore-wit;) ≈øo now he is bold to proclaime and publi≈øh it in Parliament vnder the reigne of the ≈øaid Kings ≈øonne; who≈øe tender yeeres and late ≈øucce≈øsion to the Crowne, doe make him lie the more open to iniuries, and the more facill to be circumuented: Such is now his afterwi≈øedome.</p>
               <p>Of the≈øe two Orations, that made in pre≈øence of the Nobilitie he hath, for feare of incurring the Popes di≈øplea≈øure, cautelou≈øly ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed. For therein he hath beene ≈øomewhat prodigall in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming this doctrine maintained by the Clergie, to bee but proble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall; and in taking vpon him to auouch, that Catholikes of my Kingdome are bound to yeeld me the honour of obedience: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the other ≈øide, he is not ignorant, how this doctrine of depo≈øing Princes and Kings, the Pope holdeth for meerely nece≈ø≈øarie, and approoueth not by any meanes Alleagiance to bee performed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee by the Catholikes of my Kingdome. Yea if credit may be giuen vnto the abridgement of his other Oration publi≈øhed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he paralells the Popes power in receiuing honours in the name of the Church, with the power of the Venetian Duke in receiuing honours in the name of that mo≈øt renowned Rebublike; no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile that when this Oration was di≈øpatched to the pre≈ø≈øe, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ≈øame to be gelded of this clau≈øe and other like, for feare of giuing his Holine≈ø≈øe any offen≈øiue dista≈øte.</p>
               <p>His plea≈øure therefore was, and content withall, that his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imparted to the third Estate, ≈øhould be put in Print, and of his courte≈øie he vouch≈øafed to addre≈øse vnto me a copie of the ≈øame.
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:23110:215"/>Which after J had peru≈øed, J foorthwith well perceiued, what and how great di≈øcrepance there is betweene one man that perorateth from the ingenuous and ≈øincere di≈øpo≈øition of a ≈øound heart, and an other that flaunteth in flouri≈øhing ≈øpeech with inward checkes of his owne con≈øcience: For euery where he contradicts him≈øelfe, and ≈øeemes to be afraid le≈øt men ≈øhould picke out his right meaning.</p>
               <p>First,
<note place="margin">In 12. ≈øeuerall pa≈ø≈øages the L. Card. ≈øeemeth to ≈øpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt his owne con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Pag. 85.</note> he grants this Question is not hither to decided by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, or by the Decrees of the ancient Church, or by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogie of other Eccle≈øiasticall proceedings: and neuerthele≈øse hee confidently doeth affirme, that who≈øoeuer maintaine this doctrine to be wicked and abhominable, that Popes haue no power to put Kings by their ≈øupreame Thrones, they teach men to beleeue, there hath not bene any Church for many aages past, and that indeed the Church is the very Synagogue of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he exhorts his hearers to hold this doctrine at least for problematicall, and not nece≈øsary: and yet herein he calls them to all humble ≈øubmi≈øsion vnto the iudgement of the Pope and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, by whom the cau≈øe hath bene already put out of all question, as out of all hunger and cold.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he doeth auerre, in ca≈øe this Article be authorized, it makes the Pope in good con≈øequence to bee the Antichrist:
<note place="margin">Pag. 99.</note> and yet he grants that many of the French are tolerated by the Pope to di≈ø≈øent in this point from his Holine≈øse; prouided, their doctrine be not propo≈øed as nece≈ø≈øary, and materiall to faith; As if the Pope in any ≈øort gaue toleration to hold any doctrine contrary to his owne, and mo≈øt of all that doctrine which by con≈øequence inferres him≈øelfe to be the Antichri≈øt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he prote≈øteth forwardne≈ø≈øe to vndergoe the flames of Martyrdome, rather then to ≈øigne this doctrine, which teacheth Kings Crownes to ≈øit fa≈øter on their heads, then to be ≈øtirred by any Papal power what≈øoeuer: and yet ≈øaith withall, the Pope winketh at the French, by his toleration to hold this dogmaticall point for problematicall. And by this meanes, the Martyrdome that hee affecteth in this cau≈øe, will prooue but a problematicall Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whereof que≈øtion might grow very well, whether it were to
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:23110:216"/>be mustered with grieuous crimes, or with phreneticall pa≈øsions of the braine, or with de≈øerued puni≈øhments.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, he denounceth Anathema, di≈øchargeth maledictions like haile-≈øhot, again≈øt parricides of Kings: and yet el≈øewhere hee layes him≈øelfe open to ≈øpeake of Kings onely ≈øo long as they ≈øtand Kings. But who doeth not know that a King depo≈øed is no longer King? And ≈øo that limme of Satan, which murthered <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>III.</hi> then vn-king'd by the Pope, did not ≈øtabbe a King to death.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, he doeth not allow a King to be made away by murder: and yet he thinks it not much out of the way, to take away al meanes whereby he might be able to ≈øtand in defence of his life.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly,
<note place="margin">Pag. 95.97.</note> hee abhorreth killing of Kings by apposted throat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutting, for feare lest body and ≈øoule ≈øhould peri≈øh in the ≈øame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant: and yet he doth not mi≈ølike their killing in a pitcht field, and to haue them ≈ølaughtered in a ≈øet battaile: For he pre≈øuppo≈øeth, no doubt out of his charitable mind, that by this meanes the ≈øoule of a poore King ≈øo di≈øpatched out of the way, ≈øhall instantly flie vp to heauen.</p>
               <p>Eightly, he ≈øaith a King depo≈øed, retaineth ≈øtil a certaine internal habitude and politike impre≈øsion, by vertue and efficacie whereof he may, being once reformed and become a new man, be restored to the lawfull v≈øe and practi≈øe of Regalitie. Whereby hee would beare vs in hand, that when a forraine Prince hath inuaded and rauenou≈øly ≈øei≈øed the kingdome into his hands, he will not onely take pittie of his predece≈ø≈øour to ≈øaue his life, but will al≈øo proue ≈øo kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, vpon fight of his repentance, to re≈øtore his kingdome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fraud or guile.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, he ≈øaith euery where in his Di≈øcour≈øe, that he dealeth not in the cau≈øe, otherwi≈øe then as a problematicall di≈øcour≈øer, and without any re≈øolution one way or other: and yet with might and maine hee contends for the opinion, that leaues the States and Crownes of Kings controulable by the Pope: refutes obiections, propounds the authoritie of Popes and Councils, by name the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran Councill vnder <hi>Innocent. III.</hi> as al≈øo the con≈øent of the Church. And to cro≈ø≈øe the Churches iudgement, is, in his opinion
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:23110:216"/>to bring in ≈øchi≈øme, and to leaue the world without a Church for many hundred yeeres together: which (to my vnderstanding) is to ≈øpeake with re≈øolution, and without all he≈øitation.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, he acknowledgeth none other cau≈øe of ≈øufficient vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie for the depo≈øing of a King, be≈øides herefie, aposta≈øie, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie: neuerthele≈ø≈øe that Popes haue power to di≈øplace Kings for herefie and aposta≈øie, hee proueth by examples of Kings whom the Pope hath curbed with depo≈øition, not for here≈øie, but for matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall cau≈øes, for ciuill pretences, and for lacke of capacitie.</p>
               <p>Eleuenthly, hee alledgeth euery where pa≈øsages, as well of holy Scripture, as of the Fathers and moderne hi≈øtories; but ≈øo imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and with ≈øo little trewth, as hereafter wee ≈øhall cau≈øe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that for a man of his deepe learning and knowledge, it ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not po≈øsible ≈øo to ≈øpeake out of his iudgement.</p>
               <p>La≈øtly, whereas all this hath bene hudled and heaped together into one ma≈ø≈øe, to currie with the Pope: yet hee ≈øuffereth diuers points to fall from his lips, which may well dista≈øt his Holine≈ø≈øe in the highest degree. As by name, where he prefers the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Councill before that of the Pope, and makes his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inferiour to the iudgement of the French; as in fit place here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ≈øhalbe ≈øhewed. Againe, where he repre≈øenteth to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers the decrees of Popes and Councils already pa≈ø≈øed concerning this noble ≈øubiect; and yet affirmes that he doth not debate the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion, but as a Questionist, and without re≈øolution: As if a Cardinal ≈øhould be afraid to be po≈øitiue, and to ≈øpeake in peremptory ≈øtraines, after Popes and Councils haue once decided the Question: Or as if a man ≈øhould perorate vpon hazard, in a cau≈øe for the honour whereof, he would make no difficultie to ≈øuffer Martyrdome. Adde hereunto, that his Lord≈øhip hath alwayes taken the contrary part heretofore, and this totall must needs ari≈øe, that before the third Estate, his lips looked one way, and his con≈øcience another.</p>
               <p>All the≈øe points, by the di≈øcour≈øe which is to follow, and by the ripping vp of his Oration (which by Gods a≈øsistance J will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take) tending to the reproch of Kings, and the ≈øubuer≈øion of kingdomes, J confidently ≈øpeake it, ≈øhalbe made manifest. Yet doe
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:23110:217"/>J not conceiue it can any way make for my honour, to enter the li≈øts against a Cardinall: For J am not ignorant how farre a Cardinals Hat, commeth vnder the Crowne and Scepter of a King; For well J wot vnto what ≈øublimitie the Scripture hath exalted Kings, when it ≈øtyles them Gods; Whereas the dignitie of a Cardinall is but a late vpstart inuention of man;
<note place="margin">In the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie.</note> as J haue el≈øewhere prooued. But J haue imbarqued my ≈øelfe in this action, mooued thereunto: First, by the common interest of Kings in the cau≈øe it ≈øelfe: Then by the L. Cardinall, who ≈øpeaketh not in this Oration as a priuate per≈øon, but as one repre≈øenting the body of the Clergie and Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, by whom the cau≈øe hath bene wonne, and the garland borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the third E≈øtate: Againe, by mine owne particular; becau≈øe he is plea≈øed to take me vp for a ≈øower of di≈ø≈øention, and a per≈øecutour, vnder whom the Church is hardly able to fetch her breath; yea, for one by whom the Catholikes of my Kingdome are compelled to endure all ≈øorts of puni≈øhments; and withal he tearmes this Article of the third Estate, a monster with a fi≈øhes taile that came ≈øwimming out of England: La≈øt of all, by the pre≈øent ≈øtate of France; becau≈øe France being now reduced to ≈øo mi≈øerable tearmes, that it is now become a crime for a Frenchman to ≈øtand for his King; it is a nece≈ø≈øary duetie of her neighbours to ≈øpeake in her cau≈øe, and to make triall whether they can put life into the trewth now dying, and ready to be buried by the power of violence, that it may re≈øound and ring againe from remote regions.</p>
               <p>J haue no purpo≈øe once to touch many prettie toyes which the ridges of his whole booke are ≈øowen withall: Such are his allegations of <hi>Pericles, Age≈øilaus, Ari≈øtotle, Minos,</hi> the <hi>Druides,</hi> the French Ladies, <hi>Hannibal, Pindarus,</hi> and Poeticall fables: All re≈øembling the red and blew flowers that pester the corne when it ≈øtandeth in the fields, where they are more noy ≈øome to the growing crop, then beautifull to the beholding eye. Such pettie matters, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all be≈øeemed the dignitie of the A≈ø≈øembly, and of the maine ≈øubiect, or of the Orator him≈øelfe: For it was no <hi>Decorum</hi> to enter the Stage with a <hi>Pericles</hi> in his mouth, but with the ≈øacred Name of God; nor ≈øhould hee haue mar≈øhalled the pa≈ø≈øage of a Royall
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:23110:217"/>Poet, after the example of an heathen Oratour.</p>
               <p>Neither will J giue any touch to his conceit of the Romane conquests,
<note place="margin">2 Pag. 4.</note> which the L.

Cardinall euen in the fir≈øt pa≈ø≈øage of his Oration, hath laid a firme foundation, <hi>That Eccle≈øia≈øtics in France are more deepely obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the King, then the Nobilitie, and third Estate:</hi> His rea≈øon; Becau≈øe the Clergie doe ≈øweetly enioy their dignities and promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with all their infinite wealth, of the Kings meere grace, without all danger, and with faire immunities; whereas the other two Orders hold their offices by a chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and burden≈øome title or tenure, euen to the great expence of their blood, and of their ≈øub≈øtance. But ≈øee now, how loo≈øe and weake a frame he hath erected and pinned together, vpon his firme and ≈øolide founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the third E≈øtate is to lay all care to prouide remedies again≈øt appo≈øted cut-throats, vpon the Clergy; and the ≈øaid remedies (as he bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirms) mu≈øt be deriued from the laws of con≈øcience, which may carry an effectuall acting or operatiue efficacie vpon the ≈øoule, and not from ciuil or temporall puni≈øhments. Now this con≈øequence limpeth like a lame creple after the premi≈øes: For it is no v≈øuall and common matter, to ≈øee men that are deepe≈øt in obligation, performe their duties and couenants with mo≈øt fidelity. Againe, were it graunted the Clergie had well hitherto demon≈øtrated their carefull watching ouer the life and honour of their Prince; yet is it not for ≈øpirituall puni≈øhments thundred by Eccle≈øia≈øtics, to bind the hands of the ciuill Magi≈øtrate, nor to ≈øtop the current of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:23110:218"/>puni≈øhments: which ordinarily doe carrie a greater force and vertue to the bridling of the wicked, then the apprehen≈øion of Gods iudgement.</p>
               <p>The third E≈øtate therefore, by whom all the officers of France are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly repre≈øented, as to whom the admini≈øtration of iu≈øtice and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Kings rights and Honour doth appertaine, can de≈øerue no blame in carrying ≈øo watchfull an eye, by their whole≈øome remedie to prouide for the ≈øafetie of the King, and for the dignitie of his Crowne. For if the Clergie ≈øhall not ≈øtand to their tackle, but ≈øhrinke when it commeth to the pu≈øh of their duetie; who ≈øhall charge them≈øelues with carefull fore≈øight and preuention of mi≈øchiefes? Shall not the people? Now, haue not all the calamities, which the third E≈øtate haue ≈øought prouidently to preuent; haue they not all ≈øprung from the Clergie, as from their proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fountaine? From whence did the la≈øt ciuill warres, wherein a world of blood was not more profu≈øely then prodigiou≈øly and vnnaturally ≈øpilt, and wherein the parricide of King <hi>Henrie III.</hi> was impiou≈øly and abominably committed: from whence did tho≈øe bloodie warres proceed, but from the depo≈øing of the ≈øaid King by the Head of the Church? Were they not Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, Curats, and Confe≈ø≈øours; were they not Eccle≈øia≈øtics, who partly by ≈øeditious preachments, and partly by ≈øecret confe≈ø≈øions, powred many a iarre of oyle vpon this flame? Was not he that killed the forenamed King, was not he one of the Clergie? Was not <hi>Guignard</hi> a Ie≈øuite? Was not <hi>Iohn Chastel</hi> brought vp in the ≈øame ≈øchoole? Did not <hi>Rauaillac</hi> that mon≈øter of men, vpon interrogatories made at his examination; among the re≈øt, by whom he had beene ≈øo diabolically tempted and ≈øtirred vp to his mo≈øt execrable attempt and act of extreme horror: did not he referre his exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to the Sermons made the Lent next before, where they might be ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied concerning the cau≈øes of his abominable vndertaking and execution? Are not <hi>Bellarmine, Eudaemonoiohannes, Suarez, Becanus, Mariana,</hi> with ≈øuch other mon≈øters, who teach the doctrine of parricides, vphold the craft of Ianus-like Equiuocations in Courts of Iu≈øtice, and in ≈øecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øions: are they not all Clerics? are not all their bookes approoued and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, as it were by a corporation or gro≈ø≈øe companie of Doctors, with their ≈øignes manuel to the ≈øaid bookes? What were the heads, the chiefe promoters, the complices of the powder-con≈øpiracie in my Kingdome? were they not Eccle≈øia≈øtics? Hath not <hi>Faux</hi> by name, a confederate of the ≈øame damned crew; hath not he ≈øtoutly ≈øtood to the gunners part, which then he was to act in that mo≈øt dolefull Tragedie, with a≈ø≈øeueration of a con≈øcience well a≈ø≈øured and ≈øetled, touching the lawfulne≈ø≈øe of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øe? Did he not yeild this rea≈øon? to wit, becau≈øe he had bin armed with in≈øtruction of musket proofe in the ca≈øe, before he made pa≈ø≈øage ouer from the Low Countries? Is it not al≈øo the generall beleefe of that Order, that Clerics are exempted from the condition of Subiects to the King? Nay,
<note place="margin">Pag. 7.</note> is it not confe≈ø≈øed by the L. Cardinall him≈øelfe, that King-killers haue ingaged
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:23110:219"/>them≈øelues to vndertake the dete≈øtable act of parricide vnder a fal≈øe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Religion, as beeing in≈øtructed by their ≈øchoolema≈øters in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? And who were they but Eccle≈øia≈øticall per≈øons? All this pre≈øuppo≈øed as matter of trewth, I draw this conclu≈øion: How≈øoeuer no ≈ømall number of the French Clergie may perhaps beare the affection of louing Subiects to their King, and may not ≈øuffer the Clericall character to deface the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion of naturall allegiance; yet, for ≈øo much as the Order of Clerics is dipped in a deeper die, and beareth a wor≈øe tincture of daungerous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes then the other Orders; the third E≈øtate had beene greatly wanting to their excellent prouidence and wi≈øedome, if they ≈øhould haue relinqui≈øhed and transferred the care of de≈øignements and proiects for the life of their King, and the ≈øafety of his Crowne, to the Clergiealone. Moreouer, the Clergie ≈øtandeth bound to referre the iudgement of all matters in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer≈øie, to the ≈øentence of the Pope, in this cau≈øe beeing a partie, and one that pretendeth Crownes to depend vpon his Mitre. What hope then might the third E≈øtate conceiue, that his Holine≈ø≈øe would pa≈ø≈øe again≈øt his owne cau≈øe, when his iudgement of the controuer≈øie had beene ≈øundrie times before publi≈øhed and te≈øtified to the world? And whereas the plot or modell of remedies proiected by the third E≈øtate, and the Kings Officers, hath not prooued ≈øortable in the euent: was it becau≈øe the ≈øaid remedies were not good and lawfull? No verily: but becau≈øe the Clergie refu≈øed to become contributors of their duty and meanes to the grand ≈øeruice. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, for that after the burning of bookes, addre≈ø≈øed to iu≈øtifie rebellious people, traytors, and parricides of Kings; neuerthele≈ø≈øe the authors of the ≈øaid bookes are winked at, and backt with fauour. La≈øtly, for that ≈øome wretched parricides drinke off the cuppe of publike iu≈øtice; whereas to the firebrands of ≈øedition, the ≈øowers of this abominable doctrine, no man ≈øaith ≈øo much as blacke is their eye.</p>
               <p>It ≈øufficiently appeareth, as I ≈øupo≈øe, by the former pa≈ø≈øage, that his Lord≈øhip exhorting the third E≈øtate to referre the whole care of this Regall cau≈øe vnto the Clergie, hath tacked his frame of weake ioynts and tenons to a very worthy but wrong foundation.
<note place="margin">Page 9.</note> Howbeit, he laboureth to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his exhortation with a more weake and feeble rea≈øon: For to make good his proiect he affirmes, that matters and maximes out of all doubt and que≈øtion, may not be ≈øhuffled together with points in controuer≈øie. Now his rules indubitable are two: The fir≈øt, It is not lawfull to murther Kings for any cau≈øe what≈øoeuer: This he confirmeth by the example of <hi>Saul</hi> (as he ≈øaith) depo≈øed from his Throne, who≈øe life or limbs <hi>Dauid</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthele≈ø≈øe dur≈øt not once hurt or wrong for his life:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Con≈øtan. Se≈ø≈ø.</hi> 15.</note> Likewi≈øe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the ≈øame by a Decree of the Councill held at Con≈øtance: His other point indubitable; The Kings of France are Soueraignes in all Temporall Soueraigntie, within the French Kingdome, and hold not by fealtie either of the Pope, as hauing receiued or obliged their Crownes vpon ≈øuch tenure and condition, or of any other Prince in the whole world; Which point,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:23110:219"/>neuerthele≈ø≈øe he takes not for certaine and indubitable, but onely according to humane and hi≈øtoricall certaintie. Now a third point he makes to be ≈øo full of controuer≈øie, and ≈øo farre within the circle of di≈øputable que≈øtions, as it may not be drawne into the ranke of cla≈ø≈øicall and authenticall points, for feare of making a certaine point doubtfull, by ≈øhuffling and iumbling therewith ≈øome point in controuer≈øie. Now the que≈øtion ≈øo di≈øputable, as he pretendeth, is this: A Chri≈øtian Prince breakes his oath ≈øolemnely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to God, both to liue and to die in the Catholique Religion: Say this Prince turnes Arrian, or Mahometan, fals to proclaime open warre, and to wage battell with Ie≈øus Chri≈øt: Whether may ≈øuch a Prince be declared to haue lo≈øt his Kingdome, and who ≈øhall declare the Subiects of ≈øuch a Prince to be quit of their oath of allegiance? The L. Cardinall holds the affirmatiue, and makes no bones to maintaine, that all other parts of the Catholique Church, yea the French Church, euen from the fir≈øt birth of her Theologicall Schooles, to <hi>Caluins</hi> time and teaching, haue profe≈ø≈øed that ≈øuch a Prince may bee lawfully remooued from his Throne by the Pope, and by the Councill: and ≈øuppo≈øe the contrarie doctrine were the very Quinte≈ø≈øence or ≈øpirit of trewth, yet might it not in ca≈øe of faith be vrged and pre≈ø≈øed otherwi≈øe then by way of problematicall di≈øceptation. That is the ≈øumme of his Lord≈øhips ample di≈øcour≈øe: The refuting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I am con≈øtrained to put off, and referre vnto an other place; becau≈øe he hath ≈øerued vs with the ≈øame di≈øhes ouer and ouer againe. There we ≈øhall ≈øee the L. Cardinall maketh way to the di≈øpatching of Kings after depo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that <hi>Saul</hi> was not depo≈øed, as he hath pre≈øumed: that in the Councill of Con≈øtance there is nothing to the purpo≈øe of murthering Soueraigne Princes: that his Lord≈øhip, ≈øuppo≈øing the French King may be depriued of his Crowne by a ≈øuperiour power, doth not hold his liege Lord to be So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraine in France: that by the po≈øition of the French Church from aage to aage, the Kings of France are not ≈øubiect vnto any cen≈øure of depo≈øition by the Pope: that his Holine≈ø≈øe hath no iu≈øt and lawfull pretence to produce, that any Chri≈øtian King holds of him by fealtie, or is obliged to doe the Pope homage for his Crowne.</p>
               <p>Well then, for the purpo≈øe; he dwelleth onely vpon the third point pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended que≈øtionable, and this hee affirmeth: If any ≈øhall condemne, or wrappe vnder the ≈øolemne cur≈øe, the abettours of the Popes power to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king lawfull and Soueraigne Kings; the ≈øame ≈øhall runne vpon foure dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rocks of apparent incongruities and ab≈øurdities.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, he ≈øhall offer to force and entangle the con≈øciences of many deuout per≈øons: For he ≈øhall binde them to beleeue and ≈øweare that doctrine,

For that were to make him≈øelfe both Iudge and Plaintiffe, that it might be in his power to call that doctrine Hereticall, which is pure Orthodoxe: and all for this end, to make him≈øelfe ma≈øter of the Kingdome, and there to ≈øettle a Succe≈ø≈øour, who receiuing the Crowne of the Popes free gift and grant, might be tyed thereby to depend altogether vpon his Holine≈ø≈øe.

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:23110:221"/>the great Empre≈ø≈øe and Senate ≈øought by violent cour≈øes and practi≈øes to make him yeeld. And when afterward the ≈øaid Emperour, contrary to his oath taken, played the relaps by falling into his former here≈øie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a per≈øecutor; he was fir≈øt admoni≈øhed, and then excommunicated by <hi>Symmachus</hi> Bi≈øhop of Rome. To this the L. Cardinall addes, that when the ≈øaid Emperour was minded to choppe the poi≈øon of his hereticall a≈ø≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into the publique formes of diuine ≈øeruice, then the people of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantinople made an vproare again≈øt <hi>Anasta≈øius</hi> their Emperour; and one of his Commanders by force of armes, con≈øtrained him to call backe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Bi≈øhops whom he had ≈øent into bani≈øhment before.</p>
                  <p>In this fir≈øt example the L. Cardinall by his good leaue, neither comes clo≈øe to the que≈øtion, nor falutes it a farre off. <hi>Euphemius</hi> was not Bi≈øhop of Rome: <hi>Anasta≈øius</hi> was not depo≈øed by <hi>Euphemius;</hi> the Patriarch onely made no way to the creating of <hi>Ana≈øta≈øius.</hi> The ≈øuddaine commotion of the ba≈øe multitude makes nothing, the rebellion of a Greeke Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der makes le≈ø≈øe, for the authorizing of the Pope to depo≈øe a Soueraigne Prince. The Greeke Emperour was excommunicated by Pope <hi>Symmachus:</hi> who knowes whether that be trew or forged? For the Pope him≈øelfe is the onely witne≈ø≈øe here produced by the L. Cardinall vpon the point: and who knowes not how fal≈øe, how ≈øuppo≈øitious, the writings and Epi≈øtles of the auncient Popes are iu≈øtly e≈øteemmed? But graunt it a trewth; yet <hi>Ana≈øta ≈øius</hi> excommunicated by Pope <hi>Symmachus,</hi> is not <hi>Anasta≈øius</hi> depo≈øed by Pope <hi>Symmachus.</hi> And to make a full an≈øwere, I ≈øay further, that excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation denounced by a forraine Bi≈øhop, again≈øta party not beeing within the limits of his iuri≈ødiction, or one of his owne flocke, was not any barre to the party from the communion of the Church, but onely a kind of publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that he the ≈øaid Bi≈øhop in his particular, would hold no further communion with any ≈øuch party.</p>

                  <p>And this may ≈øtand for a full an≈øwere likewi≈øe to the example of <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharius.</hi> This ancient King of the French, fearing the cen≈øures of Pope <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gapetus,</hi> erected the Territorie of Yuetor vnto the title of a Kingdome, by way of ≈øatisfaction for murdering of <hi>Gualter,</hi> Lord of Yuetot. For this example the L.

But ≈øee heere the words of <hi>Gregorie</hi> him≈øelfe to King <hi>Chilperic: If any of vs, O King, ≈øhall ≈øwarue from the path of Iu≈øtice, him ha≈øt thou power to puni≈øh: But in ca≈øe thou ≈øhalt at any time tran≈øgre≈øse the lines of equitie, who ≈øhall once touch thee with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe?

But I am not minded to make any deepe ≈øearch or inqui≈øition, into the titles of the Lords of Yue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tot; who≈øe honourable priuiledges and titles are the mo≈øt honourable badges and cognizances of their Ance≈øtours, and of ≈øome remarkeable ≈øeruice done to the Crowne of France: ≈øo farre I take them to differ from a ≈øatisfaction for ≈øinne: And for the purpo≈øe I onely affirme, that were the credit of this hi≈øtorie beyond all exception, yet makes it nothing to the pre≈øent que≈øtion, Wherein the power of depo≈øing, and not of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating ≈øupreme Kings, is debated.

Nay, doubtle≈ø≈øe it was rather a meanes to eleuate and aduance the dignitie of the Crowne of France, and to ≈øtyle the French King, a King of Kings, as one that was able to giue the qualitie of King, to all the re≈øt of the Nobles and Gentry of his Kingdome.

<note place="margin">Examp. 5.</note> belongeth to the yeere 713. And thus lies the hi≈øtorie: This Emperour <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippicus Bardanes,</hi> was a profe≈ø≈øed enemie to the wor≈øhipping of Images, and commanded them to be broken in pieces. In that very time the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire was ouerthrowen in the We≈øt, and ≈øore ≈øhaken by the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenes in the Ea≈øt. Be≈øides tho≈øe mi≈øeries, the Emperour was al≈øo incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with a ciuill and inte≈øtine warre. The greate≈øt part of Italie was then ≈øeized by the Lombards, and the Emperour in Italie had nothing left ≈øaue onely the Exarchat of Rauenna, and the Dutchie of Rome, then halfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned by rea≈øon of the Emperours want of forces. Pope <hi>Constantine</hi> gripes this occa≈øion whereon to ground his greatne≈ø≈øe, and to ≈øhake off the yoke of the Emperour his Lord, Vndertakes again≈øt <hi>Philippicus</hi> the cau≈øe of Images: by a Councel declares the Emperour Heretique: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibites his re≈øcripts or coine to bee receiued, and to goe current in Rome: Forbids his Imperiall ≈øtatue to bee ≈øet vp in the Temple, according to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cu≈øtome: The tumult groweth to a height: The Pope is principall promoter of the tumult: In the heate of the tumult the Exarche of Rauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na lo≈øeth his life. Here ≈øee now the mutinie of a ≈øubiect again≈øt his Prince, to pull from him by force and violence a citie of his Empire. But who ≈øeeth in all this any ≈øentence of depo≈øition from the Imperiall dignitie? Nay, the Pope then mi≈ø≈øed the cu≈øhion, and was di≈øappointed vtterly of his purpo≈øe: The citie of Rome ≈øtood firme, and continued ≈øtill in their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>About ≈øome 12. yeeres after,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exemp.</hi> 6.</note> the Emperour <hi>Leo I≈øauricus</hi> (whom the Lord of Perron calleth <hi>Iconocla≈øt</hi>) falles to fight it out at ≈øharpe, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecute wor≈øhippers of Images with all extremitie. Vpon this occa≈øion, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> 2. then treading in the ≈øteps of his predece≈ø≈øor, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the citie of Rome to be but weakely prouided of men or munition, and the Emperour to haue his hands full in other places, found ≈øuch meanes to make the citie ri≈øe in rebellious armes again≈øt the Emperour, that he made him≈øelfe in ≈øhort time ma≈øter thereof. Thus farre the Lord Cardinall, whereunto my an≈øwere for ≈øatisfaction is; that degrading an Emperour from his Imperiall dignitie, and reducing a citie to reuolt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt her Ma≈øter, that a man at la≈øt may carry the piece him≈øelfe, and make him≈øelfe Lord thereof, are two ≈øeuerall actions of ≈øpeciall difference. If the free-hold of the citie had beene conueied to ≈øome other by the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuing the Emperour, as proprietarie thereof, this example might haue challenged ≈øome credit at lea≈øt in ≈øhew: but ≈øo to inuade the citie to his owne v≈øe, and ≈øo to ≈øeize on the right and authority of another, what is it but open rebellion, and notorious ambition? For it is farre from Eccle≈øia≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call cen≈øure, when the ≈øpirituall Pa≈øtor of ≈øoules for≈øooth, pulles the cloake of a poore ≈øinner from his backe by violence, or cuts his pur≈øe, and thereby appropriates an other mans goods to his priuate v≈øe.

                  <p>The L.

But by authors more neere that aage wherein <hi>Childeric</hi> raigned, it is more trewly te≈øtified, that it was a free and voluntarie act of the French, onely asking the adui≈øe of Pope <hi>Zacharie,</hi> but requiring neither leaue nor ab≈øolution. <hi>Ado</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> in his Chronicles hath it after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>The French, following the Coun≈øell of Emba≈ø≈øadors, and of Pope</hi> Zachary, <hi>elected</hi> Pepin <hi>their King, and e≈øtabli≈øhed him in the Kingdome. Trithemius</hi> in his abridgement of Annals, thus: Childeric, <hi>as one vnfit for gouernement, was turned out of his Kingdome, with common con≈øent of the E≈øtates and Peeres of the Realme, ≈øo adui≈øed by Zacharie Pope of Rome. Godfridus</hi> of <hi>Viterbe</hi> in the 17. part of his Chronicle, and <hi>Guauguin</hi> in the life of <hi>Pepin,</hi> affirme the ≈øame. And was it not an ea≈øie matter to worke <hi>Pepin</hi> by coun≈øell to lay hold on the Kingdome, when he could not be hindered from fa≈øtening on the Crowne, and had already ≈øeizd it in effect, how≈øoeuer he had not yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the name of King? Moreouer, the rudene≈ø≈øe of that Nation, then wanting knowledge and Schooles either of diuinitie, or of Academi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ≈øciences, was a kind of ≈øpurre to make them runne for coun≈øell ouer the mountaines: which neuerthele≈ø≈øe in a cau≈øe of ≈øuch nature, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not as nece≈ø≈øary, but onely as decent and for fa≈øhion ≈øake. The Popeal≈øo for his part was well appaied, by this meanes to draw <hi>Pepin</hi> vnto his part; as one that ≈øtood in ≈øome neede of his aide again≈øt the Lombards; and the more, becau≈øe his Lord the Emperour of Con≈øtantinople was then brought ≈øo low, that hee was not able to ≈øend him ≈øufficient aide, for the defence of his territories again≈øt his enemies. But had <hi>Zacharie</hi> (to deale plainely) not ≈øtood vpon the re≈øpect of his owne commodity, more then vpon the regard of Gods feare; he would neuer haue giuen coun≈øell vnto the ≈øeruant, vnder the pretended colour of his Ma≈øters dull ≈øpirit, ≈øo to turne rebell again≈øt his Ma≈øter. The Lawes prouide Gardians, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeers, for ≈øuch as are not well in their wits; they neuer depriue and ≈øpoile them of their e≈øtate: they puni≈øh crimes, but not di≈øea≈øes and infirmities by nature. Yea, in France it is a very auncient cu≈øtome, when the King is troubled in his wits to e≈øtabli≈øh a Regent, who for the time of the Kings di≈øability, may beare the burden of the Kingdomes affaires. So was the

And to be ≈øhort, what rea≈øon, what equity will beare the children to be puni≈øhed for the fathers debilitie?

They ≈øhould rather haue ≈øet before their eies the example of <hi>Charles Martel,</hi> this <hi>Pepins</hi> father; who in a farre more eminent danger, when the Saracens had already ma≈øtered, and ≈øubdued a great part of France, valiantly encountred, and withall defeated the Saracens; ruled the Kingdome vnder the title of <hi>Steward</hi> of the Kings hou≈øe, the principall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of the Crowne; without affecting or a≈øpiring to the Throne for all that great ≈øtep of aduantage, e≈øpecially when the Saracens were quite bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and no longer dreadfull to the French Nation.</p>
                  <p>In our owne Scotland, the ≈øway of the Kingdome was in the hand of <hi>Walles,</hi> during the time of <hi>Bru≈øe</hi> his impri≈øonment in England, who then was lawfull heire to the Crowne. This <hi>Walles</hi> or <hi>Vallas</hi> had the whole power of the Kingdome at his becke and command. His Edicts and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances to this day ≈øtand in full force. By the deadly hatred of <hi>Bru≈øe</hi> his mortall enemie, it may be coniectured, that he might haue bene prouoked and inflamed with de≈øir√© to tru≈ø≈øe the Kingdome in his tallants. And notwith≈øtanding all the≈øe incitements, he neuer a≈ø≈øumed or v≈øurped other title to him≈øelfe, then of Gouernour or Admini≈øtratour of the Kingdome. The rea≈øon: Hee had not beene brought vp in this new doctrine and late di≈øcipline, whereby the Church is endowed with power to giue and to take away Crownes. But now (as the L. Cardinall would beare the world in hand) the ≈øtate of Kings is brought to a very dead lift. The Pope for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øooth mu≈øt ≈øend his Phy≈øicians, to know by way of in≈øpection or ≈øome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cour≈øe of Art, whether the Kings braine be cract or ≈øound: and in ca≈øe there be found any debilitie of wit and rea≈øon in the King, then the Pope mu≈øt remooue and tran≈ølate the Crowne, from the weaker braine to a ≈øtronger: and for the acting of the ≈øtratageme, the name of Religion mu≈øt be pretended. Ho, the≈øe Heretikes begin to crawle in the Kingdome: or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mu≈øt bee taken they bee not ≈øuffered by their multitudes and ≈øwarmes,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:23110:224"/>like locu≈øts or caterpillers to pe≈øter and poi≈øon the whole Realme. Or in a ca≈øe of Matrimony, thus: Ho, marriage is a Sacrament: touch the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Matrimonie, and Relgion is wounded. By this deuice not onely the Kings vices, but likewi≈øe his naturall di≈øea≈øes and infirmities are fetcht into the circle of Religion; and the L. Cardinall hath not done him≈øelfe right, in re≈øtraining the Popes power to depo≈øe Kings, vnto the ca≈øes of Here≈øie, Apo≈øta≈øie, and per≈øecution of the Church.</p>
                  <p>In the next place followeth <hi>Leo</hi> III. who by ≈øetting the Imperial Crowne vpon the head of <hi>Charles,</hi> ab≈øolued all the Subiects in the We≈øt, of their obedience to the Greeke Emperours, if the L. of Perron might bee cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited in this Example. But indeed it is crowded among the re≈øt by a ≈ølie tricke, and cleane contrary to the naked trewth of all hi≈øtories: For it ≈øhall neuer be iu≈øtified by good hi≈øtorie, that ≈øo much as one ≈øingle per≈øon or man (I ≈øay not one Countrey, or one people) was then wrought or wonne by the Pope to change his copy and Lord, or from a ≈øubiect of the Greeke Emperours, to turne ≈øubiect vnto <hi>Charlemaine.</hi> Let me ≈øee but one Towne that <hi>Charlemaine</hi> recouered from the Greeke Emperours, by his right and title to his Empire in the We≈øt: No, the Greeke Emperours had taken their farewell of the We≈øt Empire long before: And therefore to nicke this vpon the tallie of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> his Acts, that he tooke away the We≈øt from the Greeke Emperour, it is euen as if one ≈øhould ≈øay, that in this aage the Pope takes the Dukedome of <hi>Milan</hi> from the French Kings, or the citie of Rome from the Emperours of Germanie, becau≈øe their Predece≈ø≈øours in former aages had beene right Lords and gouernours of them both. It is one of the Popes ordinary and ≈øolemne practi≈øes to take away, much after the maner of his giuing: For as he giueth what he hath not in his right and power to giue, or be≈øtoweth vpon others what is already their owne; euen ≈øo he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away from Kings and Emperors the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions which they haue not in pre≈øent hold and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion. After this maner he takes the We≈øt from the Greeke Emperors, when they hold nothing in the We≈øt, and lay no claime to any citie or towne of the We≈øt Empire. And what ≈øhall wee call this way of depriuation, but ≈øpoiling a naked man of his garments, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a man already dead? Trew it is the Imperiall Crowne was then ≈øet on <hi>Charlemaines</hi> head by <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope: did <hi>Leo</hi> therefore giue him the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire? No more then a Bi≈øhop that crownes a King, at his Royall and ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne con≈øecration, doeth giue him the Kingdome: For ≈øhall the Pope him≈øelfe take the Popedome from the Bi≈øhop of <hi>O≈øtia</hi> as of his gift, becau≈øe the crowning of the Pope is an Office of long time peculiar to the <hi>O≈øtian</hi> Bi≈øhop? It was the cu≈øtome of Emperours, to be crowned Kings of Italy by the hands of the Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Milan:</hi> did he therefore giue the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Italy to the ≈øaid Emperours? And to returne vnto <hi>Charlemaine;</hi> If the Pope had conueyed the Empire to him by free and gracious donation, the Pope doubtle≈ø≈øe in the ≈øolemnitie of his coronation, would neuer haue perfourmed vnto his ownecreature, an Emperour of his owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                  <p>When <hi>Philip</hi> 1. had repudiated his wife <hi>Bertha,</hi> daughter to the Earle of <hi>Holland;</hi> and in her place had al≈øo taken to wife <hi>Bertrade</hi> the wife of <hi>Fulco</hi> Earle of <hi>Aniou</hi> yet being aliue; hee was excommunicated, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome interdicted by <hi>Vrbanus</hi> then Pope, (though he was then bearded with an Antipope) as the L. Cardinal here giueth vs to vnder≈øtand. But his Lord≈øhip hath skipt ouer two principall points recorded in the hi≈øtorie. The fir≈øt is, that <hi>Philip</hi> was not depo≈øed by the Pope: whereupon it is to be inferred, that in this pa≈ø≈øage there is nothing materiall to make for the Popes power again≈øt a Kings Throne and Scepter. The other point is, that by the cen≈øures of the Pope, the cour≈øe of obedience due to the King before was not interrupted, nor the King di≈øauowed, refu≈øed, or di≈øclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: but on the contrary, that <hi>Iuo</hi> of <hi>Chartres</hi> taking Pope <hi>Vrbanus</hi> part, was puni≈øhed for his pre≈øumption, di≈øpoyled of his e≈øtate, and kept in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon: whereof he makes complaint him≈øelfe in his 19. and 20. Epi≈øtles. The L. Cardinall be≈øides, in my vnder≈øtanding for his Ma≈øters honour, ≈øhould haue made no words of interdicting the whole Kingdome. For when the Pope, to giue a King cha≈øti≈øement, doeth interdict his Kingdome, hee makes the people to beare the puni≈øhment of the Kings offence: For du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of interdiction, the Church doores through the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are kept continually ≈øhut and lockt vp: publike ≈øeruice is intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all places: bels euery where ≈øilent: Sacraments not admini≈øtred to the people bodies of the dead ≈øo pro≈øtituted and abandoned, that none dares burie the ≈øaid bodies in holy ground. More, it is beleeued, that a man dying vnder the cur≈øe of the interdict (without ≈øome ≈øpeciall indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or priuiledge) is for euer damned and adiudged to eternall puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as one that dyeth out of the communion of the Church. Put ca≈øe then the interdict holdeth and continueth for many yeares together; alas, how many millions of poore ≈øoules are damned, and goe to hell for an others offence? For what can, or what may the faltle≈ø≈øe and innocent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doe withall, if the King will repudiate his wife, and ≈øhe yet liuing, ioyne him≈øelfe in matrimonie to an other?</p>

                  <p>Mo≈øt notable is the example of <hi>Philip the faire,</hi> and hits the bird in the right eye. In the yeere 1032. the Pope di≈øpatched the Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bona</hi> with <hi>mandates</hi> into France, commanding the King to relea≈øe the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhop of <hi>Apamia</hi> then detained in pri≈øon, for contumelious words tending to the Kings defamation, and ≈øpoken to the Kings owne head. In very deed this Pope had conceiued a ≈øecret grudge, and no light di≈øplea≈øure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt King <hi>Philip</hi> before: namely, becau≈øe the King had taken vpon him the collation of Benefices, and other Eccle≈øia≈øtical dignities. Vpon which occa≈øion the Pope ≈øent letters to the King of this tenour and ≈øtyle: <hi>Feare God, and keepe his Commandements: Wee would haue thee know, that in Spirituall and Temporall cau≈øes thou art ≈øubiect vnto our ≈øelfe: that collating of Benefices and Prebends, doeth not in any ≈øort appertaine to thy office and place: that, in ca≈øe as kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Spiritualties, thou haue the custodie of Benefices and Prebends in thy hand when they become voyd, thou ≈øhalt by ≈øequestration re≈øerue the fruits of the ≈øame, to the v≈øe and benefit of the next Incumbents and ≈øucce≈ø≈øors: and in ca≈øe thou hast heretofore collated any, we ordaine the ≈øaid collations to be meerely void: and ≈øo farre as herein thou hast proceeded to the fact, we reuoke the ≈øaid collations. We hold them for hereticks who≈øoeuer are not of this beliefe.</hi> A Legate comes to Paris, and brings the≈øe brauing letters: By ≈øome of the Kings faithfull ≈øeruants they are violently ≈ønatched and pulled out of the Legates hands: by the Earle of Artois they are ca≈øt into the fire. The good King an≈øweres the Pope, and payes him in as good coyne as he had ≈øent. <hi>Philip by the grace of God King of the French, to</hi> Boniface <hi>calling and bearing him≈øelfe the Soueraigne Bi≈øhop, little greeting or none at all. May thy exceeding ≈øotti≈øhne≈ø≈øe vnderstand, that in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall cau≈øes we are not ≈øubiect vnto any mortall and earthly creature: that collating of Benefices and Prebends, by Regall right appertaineth to our office and place: that appropriating their fruits when they become void, belongeth to our ≈øelfe alone during their vacancie: that all collations by vs heretofore made, or to bee made hereafter, ≈øhall ≈øtand in force: that in the validitie and vertue of the ≈øaid collations, wee will euer couragiou≈øly defend and maintaine, all Incumbents and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øors of Benefices and Prebends ≈øo by vs collated. We hold them all for ≈øots and ≈øen≈øele≈ø≈øe, who≈øoeuer are not of this beliefe.</hi> The Pope incen≈øed herewith, excommunicates the King: but no man dares publi≈øh that cen≈øure, or become bearer thereof.
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:23110:228"/>The King notwith≈øtanding the ≈øaid proceedings of the Pope, a≈ø≈øembles his Prelates, Barons, and Knights at Paris: askes the whole a≈ø≈øembly, of whom they hold their Fees, with al other the Temporalties of the Church.

Meane while the Pope worketh with Germanie and the Low Countreis, to ≈øtirre them vp again≈øt France.

All this notwith≈øtanding, the King pre≈øently after, from the ≈øucce≈ø≈øours of <hi>Boniface</hi> receiues very ample and gratious Bulls, in which the memorie of all the former pa≈ø≈øages and actions is vtterly aboli≈øhed.

Wherein hee not onely condemnes the Pope, as one that proceeded again≈øt <hi>Philip</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a iu≈øt cau≈øe &amp; good ground; but likewi≈øe giues the Pope the Lie, who in his goodly letters but a little aboue recited, hath enrowled <hi>Philip</hi> in the li≈øt of heretiques. Hee ≈øaith moreouer, that indeed the knot of the que≈øtion was touching the Popes pretence, in challenging to him≈øelfe the temporall Soueraigntie of France, that is to ≈øay, in qualifying him≈øelfe King of France: But indeed and indeed no ≈øuch matter to be found.

At which pretence his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈ø≈øe yet aimeth, ≈øtill attributing and challenging to him≈øelfe plenarie power to depo≈øe the King. Now if the L.

<note place="margin">Pag. 31.</note> how≈øoeuer <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> him≈øelfe made it his pretence. But his Lo. giues this for the principall cau≈øe: that <hi>Iohn d'Albret</hi> had quitted his alliance made with condition; that
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:23110:229"/>in ca≈øe the Kings of Nauarre ≈øhould infringe the ≈øaid alliance, and breake the league, then the kingdome of Nauarre ≈øhould returne to the Crowne of Arragon. This condition, betweene Kings neuer made, and without all ≈øhew of probabilitie, ≈øerueth to none other purpo≈øe from the Cardinals mouth, but onely to in≈øinuate and worke a per≈øwa≈øion in his King, that he hath no right nor lawfull preten≈øion to the Crowne of Nauarre: and what≈øoeuer hee now holdeth in the ≈øaid kingdome of Nauarre, is none of his owne, but by v≈øurpation and vnlawfull po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion. Thus his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip French-borne, makes him≈øelfe an Aduocate for the Spani≈øh King, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt his owne King, and King of the French: who ≈øhalbe faine, as hee ought (if this Aduocats plea may take place) to draw his title and ≈øtyle of King of Nauarre out of his Royall titles, and to acknowledge that all the great endeuours of his predece≈ø≈øors to recouer the ≈øaid Kingdome, were di≈øhonourable and vniu≈øt. Is it po≈ø≈øible, that in the very heart and head Citie of France, a ≈øpirit and tongue ≈øo licentious can be brooked? What, ≈øhall ≈øo great bla≈øphemie (as it were) of the Kings freehold, bee powred foorth in ≈øo honourable an a≈ø≈øembly, without puni≈øhment or fine? What, without any contradiction for the Kings right, and on the Kings behalfe? I may perhaps confe≈ø≈øe the indignitie might bee the better borne, and the pretence alledged might pa≈ø≈øe for a poore excu≈øe, if it ≈øerued his purpo≈øe neuer ≈øo little. For how doeth all this touch or come neere the que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? in which the Popes v≈øurpation in the depo≈øing of Kings, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolution of the French in re≈øi≈øting this tyrannicall practi≈øe, is the proper i≈ø≈øue of the cau≈øe: both which points are neuer a whit more of the le≈ø≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence and importance, how≈øoeuer <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in his owne iu≈øtification ≈øtood vpon the fore≈øaid pretence. Thus much is confe≈ø≈øed, and wee aske no more: Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> tooke the Kingdome from the one, and gaue it vnto the other: the French thereupon re≈øi≈øted the Pope, and declared him to be fallen from the Papacie.</p>

                     <hi>It may come to pa≈øse, that Popes either</hi>

Moreouer, in ca≈øe the Pope hath erred in the fact, it is the Clergies part adhering to their King, to make remon≈øtrances vnto the Pope, and to require the cau≈øe may be referred to the iudgement of a full Councel, the French Church then and there being pre≈øent.</hi>
                     </q> Now in this an≈øwere, the L. Cardinall is of another mind then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his brother Cardinall:
<note place="margin">Aduer≈ø. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claium.</note> For hee goes thus farre, That a Prince condemned by vniu≈øt ≈øentence of the Pope, ought neuerthele≈ø≈øe to quit his Kingdome, and that his Pa≈øtors vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iu≈øt ≈øentence ≈øhall not redound to his detriment; prouided that hee giue way to the ≈øaid ≈øentence, and ≈øhew him≈øelfe not refractarie, but ≈øtay the time in patience, vntil the holy Father ≈øhall renounce his error, and reuoke his fore≈øaid vniu≈øt ≈øentence. In which ca≈øe the≈øe two material points are to be pre≈øuppo≈øed: The one, That he who now hath ≈øeized the kingdome of the Prince di≈øplaced, wil forthwith (if the Pope ≈øhall ≈øollicit and intercede) returne the Kingdome to the hand of the late po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor: The other, That in
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:23110:233"/>the <hi>interim</hi> the Prince vniu≈øtly depo≈øed, ≈øhall not need to feare the bloody murderers mercile≈ø≈øe blade and weapon. But on the other ≈øide, the Popes power of ≈øo large a ≈øize, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath ≈øhaped, is no whit plea≈øing to the L. Cardinals eye. For in ca≈øe the King ≈øhould be vniu≈øtly depo≈øed by the Pope <hi>not well informed,</hi> he is not of the minde the Kingdome ≈øhould ≈øtoupe to the Popes behe≈øts, but will rather haue the Kingdome to deale by remon≈øtrance, and to referre the cau≈øe vnto the Council: Wherein he makes the Council to be of more ab≈øolute and ≈øupreme authority then the Pope; a ≈øtraine to which the holy father will neuer lend his eare. And yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe, the Council required in this ca≈øe mu≈øt be vniuer≈øall; wherein the French, for ≈øo much as they ≈øtand firme for the King and his cau≈øe, can be no Iudges: and in that regard the L. Cardinal requireth onely the pre≈øence of the French Church. Who ≈øeeth not here into what pickle the French cau≈øe is brought by this meanes? The Bi≈øhops of <hi>Italie</hi> for≈øooth, of <hi>Spaine,</hi> of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> of <hi>Germanie,</hi> the ≈øubiects of Soueraignes many times at profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed or priuie enmitie with <hi>France,</hi> ≈øhall haue the cau≈øe compremitted and referred to their iudgement, whether the Kindome of <hi>France</hi> ≈øhall driue out her Kings, and ≈øhall kindle the flames of ≈øeditious troubles, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart and bowels of the Realme. But is it not po≈ø≈øible, that a King may lacke the loue of his owne ≈øubiects, and they taking the vantage of that occa≈øion, may put him to his trumps in his owne Kingdome? Is it not po≈ø≈øible, that calumniations whereby a credulous Pope hath beene ≈øedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, may in like maner deceiue ≈øome part of a credulous people? Is it not po≈ø≈øible that one part of the people may cleaue to the Popes Faction, another may hold and ≈øtand out for the Kings rightfull cau≈øe, and ciuill warres may be kindled by the ≈øplene of the≈øe two ≈øides? Is it not po≈ø≈øible, that his Holine≈ø≈øe will not re≈øt in the remon≈øtrances of the French, and will no further pur≈øue his cau≈øe? And whereas now a dayes a Generall Councill cannot be held, except it be called and a≈ø≈øembled by the Popes authority; is it credible, the Pope will take order for the conuocation of a Council, by whom he ≈øhall be iudged? And how can the Pope be Pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in a Councill, where him≈øelfe is the party impleaded? and to whom the ≈øifting of his owne ≈øentence is referred, as it were to Committies, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether it was denounced according to Law, or again≈øt Iu≈øtice? But in the meane time, while≈øt all the≈øe remon≈øtrances and addre≈ø≈øes of the Council are on foot; behold, the Royall Maie≈øtie of the King hangeth as it were by loo≈øe gimmals, and mu≈øt ≈øtay the iudgement of the Council to whom it is referred. Well: what if the Councill ≈øhould happe to be two or three yeeres in a≈ø≈øembling, and to continue or hold eighteene yeeres, like the Councill of <hi>Trent;</hi> ≈øhould not poore <hi>France,</hi> I be≈øeech you, be reduced to a very bad plight? ≈øhould ≈øhe not be in a very wi≈øe and warme taking? To be ≈øhort; His Lord≈øhips whole ≈øpeach for the vntying of this knot, not onely ≈øurmounteth po≈ø≈øibilitie, but is ≈øtuft with ridiculous toyes. This I make manife≈øt by his addition in the ≈øame pa≈ø≈øage. <hi>If the Pope deceiued
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:23110:234"/>in fact, ≈øhall ra≈øhly and vniustly declare the King to be an heretike; then the Popes declaration ≈øhall not be ≈øeconded with actuall depo≈øition, vnles the Realme ≈øhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent vnto the Kings depo≈øing.</hi> What needes any man to bee in≈øtructed in this doctrine? Who doth not knowe, that a King, ≈øo long as he is vpheld and maintained in his Kingdome by his people, cannot actually and effectually be depo≈øed from his Throne? Hee that ≈øpeaketh ≈øuch language and phra≈øe, in effect ≈øaith, and ≈øaith no more then this: A King is neuer depriued of his Crowne, ≈øo long as he can keepe his Crowne on his head: a King is neuer turned and ≈øtript naked, ≈øo long as he can keepe his cloathes on his backe: a King is neuer depo≈øed, ≈øo long as he can make the ≈øtronger partie and ≈øide again≈øt his enemies: in briefe, a King is King, and ≈øhall ≈øtill remaine King, ≈øo long as he can hold the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of his Kingdome, and ≈øitfa≈øt in his Chaire of E≈øtate. Howbeit, let vs here by the way, take notice of the≈øe words vttered by his Lord≈øhip: <hi>That for the depo≈øing of a King, the con≈øent of the people must be obtained:</hi> For by the≈øe words the people are exalted aboue the King, and are made the Iudges of the Kings depo≈øing.</p>

Con≈øider with me the Prophets of olde: They were all in≈øpired and taught of God, to admoni≈øh and reprooue the Kings of Iudah and I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael: they neither erred in matter of fact, nor in point of right: they were as farre from being blinded and fetcht ouer by deceitfull calumniations, as from beeing ≈øeduced by the painted ≈øhew of corrupt and fal≈øe doctrine: As
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:23110:234"/>they neuer trode awry in matter of faith; ≈øo they neuer whetted the edge of their tongue or ≈øtyle again≈øt the faultle≈ø≈øe. Had it not beene a trimme deuice in their times, to ≈øay, that as <hi>E≈øay</hi> and as <hi>Daniel</hi> they might haue ≈øunke into here≈øie, but not as Prophets? For doubtle≈ø≈øe in this ca≈øe, that <hi>E≈øay</hi> would haue taken coun≈øell of the Prophet which was him≈øelfe. To be ≈øhort; If Kings are onely ≈øo long to be taken for Kings, vntill they ≈øhall be declared heretikes, and ≈øhall be depo≈øed by the Pope; they continually ≈øtand in extreame danger, to vndergoe a very heauy and vniu≈øt ≈øentence. Their ≈øafe≈øt way were to know nothing, and to beleeue by proxie; lea≈øt, if they ≈øhould happen to talke of God, or to thinke of religion, they ≈øhould be drawne for heretikes into the Popes Inqui≈øition.</p>
                  <p>All the examples hitherto produced by the Lord Cardinall on a rowe, are of a latter date, they lacke weight, are drawne from the time of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and make the Popes them≈øelues witne≈ø≈øes in their owne cau≈øe: They de≈øcant not vpon the point of depo≈øition, but onely ≈øtrike out and ≈øound the notes of excommunication and interdiction, which make nothing at all to the mu≈øicke of the que≈øtion. And therefore hee telleth vs (in kindne≈ø≈øe as I take it) more oftentimes then once or twice, that hee ≈øpeaketh onely of the fact; as one that doeth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him≈øelfe to bee out of the right: Hee relates things done, but neuer what ≈øhould bee done: which, as the Iudicious know, is to teach nothing.</p>

                  <p>The≈øe be our ≈øolide an≈øweres:
<note place="margin">Page 67.</note> we di≈øclaime the light armour which the L.

Now it wil be worth our labour to beate by his thru≈øts, fetcht from the ordinary mi≈ø≈øion of the New Te≈øtament, from lepro≈øie, ≈øtones, and locks of wooll: A leach no doubt of admirable skill, one that for ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting the Crownes of Kings vnto the Pope, is able to extract arguments out of ≈øtones; yea, out of the lepro≈øie, and the drie ≈øcab, onely for≈øooth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe here≈øie is a kind of lepro≈øie, and an heretike hath ≈øome affinitie with aleper. But may not his <hi>Quoniam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 66.</note> bee as fitly applyed to any contagious and inueterate vice of the minde be≈øide here≈øie? His warning-piece there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is di≈øcharged to purpo≈øe, whereby hee notifies that hee pretendeth to handle nothing with re≈øolution: For indeed vpon ≈øo weake arguments, a re≈øolution is but ill-fauouredly and weakely grounded.</p>
                  <p>His bulwarkes thus beaten downe,
<note place="margin">Page 69.</note> let vs now view the ≈øtrength of our owne. Fir≈øt, he makes vs to fortifie on this maner: <q>
                        <hi>They that are for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue, doe alleadge the authoritie of</hi> S. Paul; <hi>Let euery ≈øoule bee ≈øubiect vnto the higher powers: For who≈øoeuer re≈øi≈øteth the power, re≈øi≈øteth the ordinance of God. And likewi≈øe that of</hi> S. Peter; <hi>Submit your ≈øelues, whether it be vnto the King, as vnto the ≈øuperiour, or vnto gouernours, &amp;c. Vpon the≈øe pa≈ø≈øages, and the like, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that obedience is due to Kings by the Law of God, and not dispen≈øable by any Spirituall or Temporall authoritie.</hi>
                     </q> Thus he brings vs in with our fir≈øt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. But here the very chiefe ≈øinew and ≈øtrength of our argument, hee doeth wittingly balke, and of purpo≈øe conceale: To wit; That all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors of whom the ≈øaid holy Apo≈øtles haue made any mention in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Epi≈øtles, were profe≈ø≈øed enemies to CHRIST, Pagans, Infidels, feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and bloody Tyrants: to whom notwith≈øtanding <hi>euery ≈øoule,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bi≈øhop of Rome for one, is commanded to ≈øubmit him≈øelfe, and to profe≈ø≈øe ≈øubiection. Thus much <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtome</hi> hath expre≈øly taught in his Hom. 23. vpon the Epi≈øtle to the Romanes; <hi>The Apo≈øtle giues this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement vnto all: euen to Priests al≈øo, and cloistered Monkes not onely to Secular: be thou an Apostle an Euangelist, a Prophet, &amp;c.</hi> Be≈øides, it is here worthy to be noted, that how≈øoeuer the Apo≈øtles rule is generall, and therefore bindeth
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:23110:238"/>all the faithfull in equall bands; yet is it particularly, directly and of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe addre≈ø≈øed to the Church of Rome by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as by one who in the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of an Apo≈øtle did fore≈øee, that rebellion again≈øt Princes was to ri≈øe and ≈øpring from the citie of Rome. Now in ca≈øe the Head of that Church by warrant of any priuiledge, contained in the mo≈øt holy Regi≈øter of Gods holy word, is exempted from the binding power of this generall precept or rule; did it not become his Lord≈øhip to ≈øhew by the booke, that it is a booke ca≈øe, and to lay it foorth before that honourable a≈ø≈øembly, who no doubt expected and waited to heare when it might fall from his learned lips? But in ≈øtead of any ≈øuch authenticall and canonicall confirmation, he flieth to a ≈øleight ≈øhift, and with a cauill is bold to affirme the foundation, laid by tho≈øe of our ≈øide, doeth no way touch the knot of the controuer≈øie. Let vs heare him ≈øpeake: <q>
                        <hi>It is not in controuer≈øie, whether obedience be due to kings by Gods Law, ≈øo long as they are kings, or acknowledged for Kings, but our point controuerted, is whether by Gods Law it be required, that hee who hath bene once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogni≈øed and receiued for King by the body of E≈øtates, can at any time be taken and reputed as no King, that is to ≈øay can doe no maner of acte whereby hee may loo≈øe his right, and ≈øo cea≈øe to be ≈øaluted King.</hi>
                     </q> This an≈øwere of the L. Cardinall is the rare deui≈øe eua≈øion, and ≈øtarting hole of the <hi>Ie≈øuites:</hi> In who≈øe eares of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and tender touch, King-killing ≈øoundeth very har≈øh; but for≈øooth to vn-king a King fir≈øt, and then to giue him the ≈øtab, that is a point of iu≈øt and trew de≈øcant: For to kill a King, once vnking'd by depo≈øition, is not killing of a King: For the pre≈øent, I haue one of that Ie≈øuiticall Order in pri≈øon, who hath face enough to ≈øpeake this language of A≈øhdod, and to maintaine this doctrine of the <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> Colledges. The L. Cardinall harpes vpon the ≈øame ≈øtring; He can like ≈øubiection and obedience to the King, while≈øt he ≈øitteth King: but his Holine≈ø≈øe mu≈øt haue all power, and giue order withall, to hoy≈øt him out of his Royall Seat. I therefore now an≈øwer, that in very deed the former pa≈ø≈øages of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Peter</hi> ≈øhould come no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing neere the que≈øtion, if the ≈øtate of the que≈øtion were ≈øuch as he brings it, made and forged in his owne ≈øhop. But certes the ≈øtate of the que≈øtion is not, whether a King may doe ≈øome acte, by rea≈øon whereof hee may fall from his right, or may not any longer be acknowledged for King: For all our contention is, concerning the Popes power to vn-authorize Princes; wheras in the que≈øtion framed and fitted by the L. Cardinal, not a word of the Pope. For were it granted and agreed on both ≈øides, that a King by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction might fal from his Kingdom, yet ≈øtil the knot of the que≈øtion would hold, whether he can be di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of his Regal authoritie, by any power in the Pope, &amp; whether the Pope hath ≈øuch fulnes of power, to ≈øtrip a King of tho≈øe Royall robes, rights, and reuenewes of the Crowne, which were neuer giuen him by the Pope; as al≈øo by what authoritie of holy Scripture, the Pope is able to beare out him≈øelfe in this power, and to make it good.</p>
                  <p>But here the L. Card. ≈øtoutly ≈øaith in his owne defence by way of reioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<note place="margin">Page 71.</note> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>As one text hath, Let euery ≈øoule be ≈øubiect vnto the higher powers; in like maner
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:23110:238"/>an other text hath, Obey your Prelates, and be ≈øubiect vnto your Pa≈øtors:for they watch ouer your ≈øoules, as men that ≈øhall giue an accompt for your ≈øoules.</hi>
                     </q> This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon is void of rea≈øon, and makes again≈øt him≈øelfe: For may not Prelates be obeyed and honoured, without Kings be depo≈øed? If Prelates preach the doctrine of the Co≈øpell, will they in the pulpit ≈øtirre vp ≈øubiects to rebell again≈øt Kings? Moreouer, whereas the vniuer≈øall Church in the≈øe daies is diuided into ≈øo many di≈øcrepant parts, that now Prelates neither doe nor can draw all one way; is it not exceeding hard, keeping our obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, to honour them all at once with due obedience? Nay is not here offered vnto me a dart out of the L. Cardinals armorie, to ca≈øt at him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe? For as God chargeth all men with obedience to Kings, and yet from that commaundement of God, the L. Cardinall would not haue it infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that Kings haue power to degrade Eccle≈øia≈øticall Prelates: euen ≈øo God giueth charge to obey Prelates, yet doeth it not follow from hence, that Prelates haue power to depo≈øe Kings. The≈øe two degrees of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence agree well together, and are each of them bounded with peculiar and proper limits.</p>
                  <p>But for ≈øo much as in this point, we haue on our ≈øide the whole auncient Church, which, albeit ≈øhe liued and groned for many aages together vnder heathen Emperours, heretikes, and per≈øecuters, did neuer ≈øo much as whi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per a word about rebelling and falling from their Soueraigne Lords, and was neuer by any mortall creature freed from the oath of allegiance to the Emperour; the Cardinall is not vnwilling to graunt, that ancient Chri≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in tho≈øe times were bound to performe ≈øuch fidelity and allegiance, for as much as the Church (the Cardinall for ≈øhame dur≈øt not ≈øay the Pope) then had not ab≈øolued them of their oath. No doubt a plea≈øant dreame, or a merry conceit rather, to imagine the Bi≈øhop of Rome was armed with power to take away the Empire of the world from <hi>Nero,</hi> or <hi>Claudius,</hi> or <hi>Domitianus;</hi> to whom it was not knowen, whether the citie of Rome had any Bi≈øhop at all. Is it not a ma≈øter-ie≈øt, of a ≈øtraine mo≈øt ridiculous, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuppo≈øe the Grand-ma≈øters and ab≈øolute Lords of the whole world, had a ≈øent ≈øo dull, that they were not able to ≈ømell out, and to no≈øe things vnder their owne no≈øes? that they ≈øaw ≈øo little with other mens eies and their owne, that within their capitall citie, they could not ≈øpie that Soueraigne armed with ordinary and lawfull authority to degrade, and to turne them out of their renowned Empire? Doubtle≈ø≈øe the ≈øaid Emperours, va≈ø≈øals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the Popes Empire, are to be held excu≈øed for not acknowledging and honouring the Pope in quality of their Lord, as became his va≈ø≈øals; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they did not know there was any ≈øuch power in the world, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times haue magnified and adored vnder the qualitie of Pope: For the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops of Rome in tho≈øe times, were of no greater authoritie, power, and meanes, then ≈øome of the Bi≈øhops are in the≈øe daies within my Kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>But certes tho≈øe Popes of that primitiue aage, thought it not expedient in the ≈øaid times to draw their ≈øwords: they exerci≈øed their power in a more
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:23110:239"/>mild and ≈øoft kind of carriage toward tho≈øe mi≈øerable Emperours, for three ≈øeuerall rea≈øons alledged by the L. Cardinall.</p>
                  <p>The fir≈øt: becau≈øe the Bi≈øhops then dur≈øt not by their cen≈øures whet and prouoke tho≈øe Emperours, for feare of plunging the Church in a Sea of per≈øecutions. But if I be not cleane voide of common ≈øen≈øe, this rea≈øon ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to charge not onely the Bi≈øhops of Rome, but all the auncient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øors of Chri≈øt be≈øides, with deepe di≈ø≈øimulation and hypocri≈øie: For it is all one as if he had profe≈ø≈øed, that all their obedience to their Soueraignes, was but counterfeit, and extorted, or wrong out of them by force; that all the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øiue ≈øupplications of the auncient Fathers, the a≈ø≈øured te≈øtimonies and pledges of their allegiance, humilitie, and patience, were but certaine formes of di≈øgui≈øed ≈øpeech, proceeding not freely from the ≈øugge≈øtions of fidelity, but faintly and fainedly, or at lea≈øt from the ≈øtrong twitches and violent conuul≈øions of feare. Whereupon it followes, that all their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and puni≈øhments, euen to the death, are wrongfully honoured with the title, and crowned with the crowne of Martyrdome; becau≈øe their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience proceeded not from their owne free choice and election, but was taught by the force of nece≈ø≈øitie, as by compul≈øion: and whereas they had not mutinou≈øly and rebelliou≈øly ri≈øen in armes, to a≈ø≈øwage the ≈øcorching heat and burning flames of tyrannicall per≈øecuters, it was not for want of will, but for lacke of power.

                        <hi>The Christians mooued with respect vnto the fre≈øh memory both of the brother and father, as al≈øo vnto the weake estate of the ≈øonnes young yeeres, abstained from all coun≈øels and cour≈øes of ≈øharper effect and operation.</hi>
                     </q> To which an≈øwere I replie: the≈øe are but friuolous coniectures, deui≈øed and framed to ticle his owne fancie: For had <hi>Valentinianus</hi> the younger beene the ≈øonne of an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and had then al≈øo attained to three≈øcore yeeres of aage, they would neuer haue borne them≈øelues in other fa≈øhion then they did, towards their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Then the Cardinall goeth on: The people would not abandon the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:23110:240"/>factious and ≈øeditious party, but were ≈øo firme or ob≈øtinate rather for the faction, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> for feare of the tumultuous vproares was con≈øtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to giue way, and was threatened by the ≈øouldiers, that except hee would adhere vnto the Catholikes, they would yeeld him no a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, nor ≈øtand for his partie. Now this an≈øwere of the L. Cardinall makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpo≈øe, concerning the Popes power to pull downe Kings from their ≈øtately ne≈øt.

                     </q> Touching the latter of the≈øe two, (as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhippe ≈øaith) <q>
                        <hi>If they ≈øhall as it were take an oath, and make a vowe contrary to their first oath and vow made and taken when they were installed, and contrary to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition vnder which they receiued the Scepter of their Fathers; if they withall ≈øhall turne per≈øecutors of the Catholike religion;</hi>
                     </q> touching the≈øe I ≈øay, the L.

Touching Kings depo≈øed by the Pope vnder pretence of ≈øtupidity, as <hi>Childeric;</hi> or of matrimoniall cau≈øes, as <hi>Philip</hi> I. or for collating of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as <hi>Philip</hi> the Faire; not one word: By that point he ea≈øily glideth, and ≈øhuffles it vp in ≈øilence, for feare of di≈øta≈øting the Pope on the one ≈øide, or his auditors on the other.</p>
                  <p>Now in alledging this rea≈øon, his Lord≈øhip makes all the world a witnes, that in depo≈øing of Kings, the Pope hath no eye of regard to the benefit and ≈øecuritie of the Church: For ≈øuch Princes as neuer ≈øuckt other milke then that of Infidelitie, and per≈øecution of Religion, are no le≈ø≈øe noi≈øome and pernicious vermin to the Church, then if they had ≈øucked of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:23110:242"/>brea≈øts. And as for the greatne≈ø≈øe of the ≈øinne or offence, it ≈øeemes to me there is very little difference in the matter. For a Prince that neuer did ≈øweare any religious obedience to <hi>Ie≈øus Christ,</hi> is bound no le≈ø≈øe to ≈øuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, then if he had taken a ≈øolemne oath: As the ≈øonne that rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly ≈øtands vp again≈øt his father, is in equall degree of ≈øinne, whether he hath ≈øworne or not ≈øworne obedience to his father; becau≈øe he is bound to ≈øuch obedience, not by any voluntarie contract or couenant, but by the law of Nature. The commaundement of God to ki≈ø≈øe the Sonne, whom the Father hath confirmed and ratified King of Kings, doeth equally bind all Kings, as well Pagans as Chri≈øtians. On the other ≈øide, who denies, who doubts, that <hi>Con≈øtantius</hi> Emperour at his fir≈øt ≈øteppe or entrance into the Empire, did not ≈øweare and bind him≈øelfe by ≈øolemne vowe, to keepe the rules and to maintaine the precepts of the Orthodox faith, or that he did not receiue his fathers Empire vpon ≈øuch condition? This notwith≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome</hi> pulled not <hi>Con≈øtantius</hi> from his Imperiall throne, but <hi>Con≈øtantius</hi> remooued the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Rome</hi> from his Papall See. And were it ≈øo, that an oath taken by a King at his con≈øecration, and after viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is a ≈øufficient cau≈øe for the Pope to depo≈øe an Apo≈øtate or hereticall Prince; then by good con≈øequence the Pope may in like ≈øort depo≈øe a King, who beeing neither dead in Apo≈øta≈øie, nor ≈øicke of Here≈øie, doeth neglect onely the due admini≈øtration of iu≈øtice to his loyall ≈øubiects: For his oath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at con≈øecration importeth likewi≈øe, that he ≈øhall mini≈øter iu≈øtice to his people. A point wherein the holy Father is held ≈øhort by the L.

Meane while his Lord≈øhip forgets, that King <hi>Attabaliba</hi> was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed by the Pope from his Kingdome of <hi>Peru,</hi> and the ≈øaid Kingdome was conferred vpon the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> though the ≈øaid poore King of <hi>Peru,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer for≈øooke his heathen ≈øuper≈øtition; and though the turning of him out of his terre≈øtriall Kingdome was no way to conuert him vnto the faith of Chri≈øt.

                     <pb n="441" facs="tcp:23110:242"/>And certes to any man that weighs the matter with due con≈øideration, it wil be found apparantly fal≈øe, that Kings of <hi>France</hi> haue bene receiued of their ≈øubiects at any time, with condition to ≈øerue IESVS CHRIST. They were actually Kings before they came forth to the ≈øolemnitie of their ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring, before they v≈øed any ≈øtipulation or promi≈øe to their ≈øubiects. For in hereditary kingdoms, (nothing more certaine, nothing more vncontroule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) the Kings death in≈øtantly maketh liuery and ≈øei≈øin of the Royaltie, to his next ≈øucce≈ø≈øour. Nor is it materiall to replie, that a King ≈øucceeding by right of inheritance, takes an oath in the per≈øon of his predece≈ø≈øor. For euery oath is per≈øonall, proper to the per≈øon by whom it is taken: and to God no liuing creature can ≈øweare, that his owne ≈øonne or his heire ≈øhall proue an hone≈øt man. Well may the father, and with great ≈øolemnitie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe that he will exhort his heire apparant with all his power and the be≈øt of his endeauours, to feare God and to practi≈øe piety. If the fathers oath be agreeable to the dueties of godline≈ø≈øe, the ≈øonne is bound thereby, whether he take an oath, or take none. On the other ≈øide, if the fathers oath come from the puddles of impietie, the ≈øonne is bound thereby to goe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way.

                  <p>When I call the≈øe things to mind with ≈øome attention, I am out of all doubt, his Lord≈øhip is very much to ≈øeeke, in the right ≈øen≈øe and nature of his Kings oath taken at his Coronation, to defend the Church, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeuere in the Catholike faith: For what is more vnlike and le≈ø≈øe credible then this conceit, that after <hi>Clouis</hi> had reigned 15. yeeres in the ≈øtate of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gani≈øme, and then receiued holy Bapti≈øme, he ≈øhould become Chri≈øtian vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this condition, That in ca≈øe hee ≈øhould afterward reuolt from the Faith, it ≈øhould then bee in the power of the Church, to turne him out of his Kingdome?

                  <p>In which words of the Cardinall, the word <hi>Receiued,</hi> is to bee ob≈øerued e≈øpecially and aboue the re≈øt: For by chopping in that word, hee doeth nimbly and with a tricke of <hi>Legier-demain,</hi> transforme or change the very ≈øtate of the que≈øtion. For the que≈øtion or i≈ø≈øue of the cau≈øe, is not about receiuing, e≈øtabli≈øhing, or choo≈øing a Prince; (as in tho≈øe Nations where the Kingdome goes by election) but about doing homage to the Prince, when God hath ≈øetled him in the Kingdome, and hath ca≈øt it vpon a Prince by hereditary ≈øucce≈ø≈øion: For that which is writtten, <hi>Thou ≈øhalt make thee a King,</hi> doeth no way concerne and touch the people of <hi>France</hi> in the≈øe dayes: becau≈øe the making of their King hath not of long time been tyed to their election.

<pb n="443" facs="tcp:23110:243"/>confe≈ø≈øion, that a Chri≈øtian Prince is to haue ≈øpeciall care of the Lawes, and to prouide that no vnbeleeuer be made Lord Chiefe-Iu≈øtice of the Land, that no Infidel be put in tru≈øt with admini≈øtration of Iu≈øtice to the people.

Our que≈øtion is, whether ≈øuch a Prince can be vnthroned by the Pope, by whom he was not placed in the Throne; and whether the Pope can de≈øpoile ≈øuch a Prince, of that Royaltie which was neuer giuen him by the Pope, vnder any pretended colour and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of here≈øie, of ≈øtupiditie, or infringing the priuiledges of Mona≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or tran≈øgre≈ø≈øing the Lawes and lines of holy Matrimonie.</p>
                  <p>Now that S. <hi>Pauls</hi> commandement which bindeth euery ≈øoule in the bands of ≈øubiection vnto the higher powers, is no precept giuen by way of <hi>proui≈øo,</hi> and onely to ≈øerue the times, but a ≈øtanding and a perpetuall rule, it is hereby more then manife≈øt. S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath grounded this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon certaine rea≈øons, not onely con≈øtant and permanent by their proper nature, but likewi≈øe nece≈ø≈øary for euery ≈øtate, condition, and reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the times. His rea≈øons; <hi>Becau≈øe all powers are ordained of God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe re≈øisting of powers is re≈øisting the ordinance of God: becau≈øe the Magistrate beares the ≈øword to execute iustice: becau≈øe obedience and ≈øubiection to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate is nece≈ø≈øary, not onely for feare of his wrath, or feare of puni≈øhment, but al≈øo for con≈øcience ≈øake.</hi> It is therefore a ca≈øe grounded vpon con≈øcience, it is not a Law deui≈øed by humane wi≈øedome; it is not fa≈øhionable to the qualities of the times. Apo≈øtolicall in≈øtructions for the right informing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, are not changeable according to times and ≈øea≈øons. To v≈øe the L. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals language, and to follow his fancie in the matter, is to make way for two pe≈øtiferous mi≈øchiefes: Fir≈øt, let it be free and lawfull for Chri≈øtians, to hold the commanding rules of GOD for proui≈øionall cautions, and what followes? Men are ledde into the broad way of impietie, and the whole Scripture is wiped of all authoritie. Then againe, for the other mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe: The glorious triumphes of mo≈øt ble≈ø≈øed Martyrs in their vn≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able torments and ≈øufferings, by the L.

                  <p>Meane while the indifferent Reader is to con≈øider, how greatly this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is preiudicial, and how full of danger, to Chri≈øtians liuing vnder he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall or Pagan Princes. For make it once knowne to the Emperour of Turkes, let him once get neuer ≈øo little a ≈ømacke of this doctrine; that Chri≈øtians liuing vnder his Empire doe take Gods commandement, for obedience to Princes whom they count Infidels, to be onely a proui≈øional precept for a time, and wait euery houre for all occa≈øions to ≈øhake off the yoke of his bondage; doubtle≈ø≈øe he will neuer ≈øpare with all ≈øpeed to roote the whole ≈øtocke, with all the armes and branches of Chri≈øtians out of his dominions. Adde hereunto the L. Cardinals former determination; that po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion kept neuer ≈øo long by the Turke in his Conque≈øts ouer Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, gaines him not by ≈øo long tract of time one inch of pre≈øcription; and it will appeare, that his Lord≈øhip puts the Turki≈øh Emperour in minde, and by his in≈øtruction leades the ≈øaid Emperour as it were by the hand, to haue no maner of affiance in his Chri≈øtian ≈øubiects; and withall to afflict his poore Chri≈øtians with all ≈øorts of mo≈øt grieuous and cruell torments. In this regard the poore Chri≈øtans of Graecia and Syria, mu≈øt needs be very little beholden to his Lord≈øhip. As for my ≈øelfe, and my Popi≈øh Subiects, to whom I am no le≈ø≈øe then an heretike for≈øooth am not I by this doctrine of the Cardinall, pricked and whetted again≈øt my naturall inclination, to turne clemencie into rigour; ≈øeeing that by his doctrine my ≈øubiects are made to beleeue, they owe me ≈øubiection onely by way of <hi>proui≈øo,</hi> and with waiting the occa≈øion to worke my vtter de≈øtruction and finall ruine; the rather, becau≈øe Turkes, mi≈øcreants, and heretikes are mar≈øhalled by the Cardinall in the ≈øame ranke; and heretikes are counted wor≈øe, yea more iu≈øtly depo≈øeable, then Turkes and Infidels, as irreligious breakers and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters of their oath?

Cardinall to bee heretikes, are not halfe ≈øo bad as my Romane Catholike ≈øubiects, who by ≈øecret practi≈øes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine my life, ≈øerue a forreine Souereigne, are di≈øcharged by his Bulls of their obedience due to me their naturall Souereigne, are bound (by the maximes and rules publi≈øhed and maintained in fauour of the Pope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this full and famous a≈ø≈øemblie of the E≈øtate at <hi>Paris;</hi> if the ≈øaid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes be of any weight and authoritie) to hold mee for no lawfull King, are there taught and in≈øtructed, that <hi>Pauls</hi> commandemement concerning ≈øubiection vnto the higher Powers, aduer≈øe to their profe≈ø≈øed religion, is onely a proui≈øionall precept, framed to the times, and watching for the opportunitie to ≈øhake off the yoake. All which notwith≈øtanding, I deale with ≈øuch Romane-Catholikes by the rules and wayes of Princely cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie; their heinous and pernicious error, in effect no le≈ø≈øe then the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall crime of high trea≈øon, I v≈øe to call ≈øome di≈øea≈øe or di≈øtemper of the mind. La≈øt of all, I beleeue my ≈øaid brother of <hi>France</hi> will ≈øet downe in his tables, as in record, how little hee ≈øtandeth ingaged to the L. Cardinall in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: For tho≈øe of the reformed Religion profe≈ø≈øe and proclaime, that next vnder God, they owe their pre≈øeruation and ≈øafetie to the wi≈øedome and benignity of their Kings. But now comes the Cardinall, and he ≈øeekes to ≈øteale this per≈øwa≈øion out of their hearts: He tells them in open Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and without any going about bu≈øhes, that all their welfare and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie ≈øtandeth in their multitude, and in the feare which others conceiue
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:23110:246"/>to trouble the State, by the ≈øtrict execution of lawes again≈øt Heretikes.</p>
                  <p>He addeth moreouer,
<note place="margin">Note by the way that here the Church of Rome is called a Sect.</note> that <hi>In ca≈øe a third Sect ≈øhould peepe out and growe vp in</hi> France, <hi>the profe≈ø≈øors thereof ≈øhould ≈øuffer confi≈øcation of their goods, with lo≈ø≈øe of life it ≈øelfe; as hath bene practi≈øed at</hi> Geneua <hi>against</hi> Seruetus, <hi>and in</hi> England <hi>again≈øt</hi> Arians. My an≈øwere is this, That puni≈øhments for heretikes, duely and according to Law conuicted, are ≈øet downe by decrees of the ciuill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrate, bearing rule in the countrey where the ≈øaid heretikes inhabite, and not by any ordinances of the Pope. I ≈øay withall, the L. Cardinall hath no rea≈øon to match and parallell the reformed Churches with <hi>Seruetus</hi> and the <hi>Arians:</hi> For tho≈øe heretikes were powerfully conuicted by Gods word, and lawfully condemned by the ancient Generall Councils, where they were permitted and admitted to plead their owne cau≈øe in per≈øon. But as for the trewth profe≈ø≈øed by me, and tho≈øe of the reformed Religion, it was neuer yet hi≈ø≈øed out of the Schooles, nor ca≈øt out of any Council, (like ≈øome Parliament bills) where both ≈øides haue bene heard with like indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencie. Yea, what Council ≈øoeuer hath bene offered vnto vs in the≈øe latter times, it hath bene propo≈øed with certaine pre≈øuppo≈øitions: as, That his Holine≈ø≈øe (beeing a partie in the cau≈øe, and con≈øequently to come vnder iudgement as it were to the barre vpon his triall) ≈øhall be the Iudge of A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øize with Commi≈ø≈øion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Determiner:</hi> it ≈øhall bee celebrated in a citie of no ≈øafe acce≈ø≈øe, without ≈øafe conduct or conuoy to come or goe at plea≈øure, and without danger: it ≈øhall be a≈ø≈øembled of ≈øuch per≈øons with free ≈øuffrage and voyce, as vphold this rule, (which they haue already put in practi≈øe again≈øt <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prage</hi>) that faith giuen, and oath taken to an Heretike, mu≈øt not be ob≈øerued.</p>
                  <p>Now then to re≈øume our former matter; If the Pope hitherto hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer pre≈øumed, for pretended here≈øie to confi≈øcate by ≈øentence, either the lands or the goods of priuate per≈øons, or common people of the French Nation, wherefore ≈øhould hee dare to di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe Kings of their Royall thrones? wherefore takes he more vpon him ouer Kings, then ouer priuate per≈øons; wherefore ≈øhall the ≈øacred heads of Kings be more churli≈øhly, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuilly, and rigorou≈øly handled, then the hoods of the meane≈øt people? Here the L. Cardinal in ≈øtead of a direct an≈øwer, breakes out of the li≈øts, alledging cleane from the purpo≈øe examples of heretikes puni≈øhed, not by the Pope, but by the ciuill Magi≈øtrate of the Countrey: But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ≈øpeakes to the point with a more free and open heart: hee is ab≈øolute and re≈øolute in this opinion, that his Holine≈ø≈øe hath plenary power to di≈øpo≈øe all Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall e≈øtates and matters in the whole world; <hi>I am confident</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) <hi>and I ≈øpeake it with a≈ø≈øurance,

By this Canon the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> hath need to looke well vnto it ≈øelfe. For one duell it may fall into the Exchecquer of the Romane Church; becau≈øe that Kingdome payeth a Reliefe to the Church, as a Royaltie or Seignorie that holdeth in fee of the ≈øaid Church. And in <hi>France</hi> there is not one Lord≈øhip, not one Mannor, not one farme which the Pope by this meanes cannot ≈øhift ouer to a new Lord. His Lord≈øhip therefore had carried him≈øelfe and the cau≈øe much better, if in ≈øtead of ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ≈øuch idle ≈øhifts, he had by a more large a≈ø≈øertion maintained the Popes power to di≈øpo≈øe of priuate mens po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, with no le≈ø≈øe right and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie then of Kingdomes: For what colour of rea≈øon can bee giuen, for making the Pope Lord of the whole, and not of the parts? for making him Lord of the forre≈øt in gro≈ø≈øe, and not of the trees in parcell? for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him Lord of the whole hou≈øe, and not of the parlour or the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning chamber?</p>
                  <p>His Lord≈øhip alleadgeth yet an other rea≈øon, but of no better weight: <hi>Betweene the power of priuate owners ouer their goods, and the power of Kings ouer their e≈øtates, there is no little difference: For the goods of priuate per≈øons are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for their owners, and Princes for the benefit of their Common-wealths.</hi> Heare me now an≈øwere. If this Cardinal-rea≈øon hath any force to inferre, that a King may lawfully be depriued of his Kingdome for here≈øie, but a priuate per≈øon cannot for the ≈øame crime be turned out of his man≈øion hou≈øe; then it ≈øhall follow by the ≈øame rea≈øon, that a Father for the ≈øame cau≈øe may
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:23110:247"/>bee depriued of all power ouer his children, but a priuate owner cannot be depriued of his goods in the like ca≈øe: becau≈øe goods are ordeined for the benefit and comfort of their owners, but fathers are ordeined for the good and benefit of their children: But mo≈øt certain it is, that Kings repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenting the image of God in earth and Gods place, haue a better and clo≈øer ≈øeate in their chaires of E≈øtate, then any priuate per≈øons haue in the ≈øaddle of their inheritances and patrimonies, which are dayly ≈øeene for ≈øleight cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, to flit and to fall into the hands of new Lords: Whereas a Prince being the Head, cannot bee loo≈øed in the proper ioynt, nor di≈ømounted; like a cannon when the carriage thereof is vnlockt, without a ≈øore ≈øhaking and a mo≈øt grieuous di≈ølocation of all the members, yea, without ≈øubuerting the whole bodie of the State, whereby priuate per≈øons without number are inwrapped together in the ≈øame ruine; euen as the lower ≈øhrubs and other bru≈øh-wood are cru≈øhed in pieces altogether by the fall of a great oake. But ≈øuppo≈øe his Lord≈øhips rea≈øon were ≈øomewhat ponderous and ≈øolide withall, yet a King (which would not bee forgotten) is endowed not onely with the Kingdome, but al≈øo with the ancient De≈ømenes and Crowne-lands, for which none can be ≈øo ≈øimple to ≈øay, The King was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined and created King; which neuerthele≈ø≈øe he lo≈øeth when hee lo≈øeth his Crowne. Admit againe this rea≈øon were of ≈øome pith, to make mighty Kings more ea≈øily depo≈øeable then priuate per≈øons from their patrimonies; yet all this makes nothing for the deriuing and fetching of depo≈øition from the Popes Con≈øi≈øtorie. What hee neuer conferred, by what right or power can he claime to take away?</p>
                  <p>But ≈øee heere no doubt a ≈øharpe and ≈øubtile difference put by the L. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall betweene a Kingdome, and the goods of priuate per≈øons. <hi>Goods,</hi> as <q>his Lord≈øhip ≈øaith, <hi>are without life: they can be con≈øtrained by no force, by no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, by no inducement of their owners to lo≈øe eternall life: Subiects by their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may.</hi>
                     </q> Now I am of the contrary beliefe, That an hereticall owner, or ma≈øter of a family, hath greater power and meanes withall, to ≈øeduce his owne ≈øeruants and children, then a Prince hath to peruert his owne ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects; and yet for the contagion of Here≈øie, and for corrupt religion, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not remoued from their parents, nor ≈øeruants are taken away from their ma≈øters. Hi≈øtories abound with examples of mo≈øt flouri≈øhing Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, vnder a Prince of contrary religion. And if things without life or ≈øoule are with le≈ø≈øe danger left in an heretikes hands; why then ≈øhall not an hereticall King with more facilitie and le≈ø≈øe danger keepe his Crowne, his Royall charge, his lands, his cu≈øtomes, his impo≈øts, &amp;c? For will any man, except he bee out of his wits, affirme the≈øe things to haue any life or ≈øoule? Or why ≈øhall it bee counted folly, to leaue a ≈øword in the hand of a mad Bedlam? Is not a ≈øword al≈øo without life and ≈øoule? For my part, I ≈øhould rather be of this minde; that po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of things without rea≈øon, is more dangerous and pernicious in the hands of an euill ma≈øter, then the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of things endued with life and rea≈øon: For things without
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:23110:247"/>life lacke both rea≈øon and iudgement, how to exempt and free them≈øelues from being in≈øtruments in euill and wicked actions, from being emploied to vngodly and abominable v≈øes. I will not deny, that an hereticall Prince is a plague, a pernicious and mortall ≈øickene≈ø≈øe to the ≈øoules of his ≈øubiects: But a breach made by one mi≈øchiefe, mu≈øt not bee filled vp with a greater inconuenience: An errour mu≈øt not be ≈øhocked and ≈øhouldered with di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loialtie, nor here≈øie with periurie, nor impietie with ≈øedition and armed rebellion again≈øt GOD and the King. GOD, who v≈øeth to try and to ≈øchoole his Church, will neuer for≈øake his Church; nor hath need to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect his Church by any proditorious and prodigious practi≈øes of perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chri≈øtians: For he makes his Church to be like the burning bu≈øh: In the midde≈øt of the fire and flames of per≈øecutions, hee will prouide that ≈øhe ≈øhall not be con≈øumed, becau≈øe hee ≈øtandeth in the mid≈øt of his Church. And ≈øuppo≈øe there may be ≈øome iu≈øt cau≈øe for the French, to play the rebels again≈øt their King; yet will it not follow, that ≈øuch rebellious motions are to be rai≈øed by the bellowes of the Romane Bi≈øhop, to who≈øe Pa≈øtorall charge and office it is nothing proper, to intermeddle in the ciuill affaires of forraine Kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>Here is the ≈øumme and ≈øub≈øtance of the L. Cardinals whole di≈øcour≈øe, touching his pretence of the ≈øecond inconuenience. Which di≈øcour≈øe hee hath clo≈øed with a remarkeable confe≈ø≈øion: to wit, that neither by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of holy Scripture, nor by the the te≈øtimonie and verdict of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, there hath bene any full deci≈øion of this que≈øtion. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof he falleth into admiration, that Lay-people haue gone ≈øo farre in audaciou≈øne≈ø≈øe, as to labour that a doubtfull doctrine might for euer pa≈ø≈øe currant, and be taken for a new article of faith. <q>
                        <hi>What a ≈øhame, what a reproach is this? how full of ≈øcandall?</hi> for ≈øo his Lord≈øhip is plea≈øed to cry out. <hi>This breakes into the ≈øeueralls and inclo≈øures of the Church: this lets in whole herds of here≈øies to gra≈øe in her greene and ≈øweet pastures.</hi>
                     </q> On the other ≈øide, without any ≈øuch Rhetoricall outcries, I ≈øimply affirme: It is a reproach, a ≈øcandall, a crime of rebellion, for a ≈øubiect hauing his full charge and loade of benefits, in the new ≈øpring of his Kings tender aage, his King-fathers blood yet reeking, and vpon the point of an addre≈ø≈øe for a double match with Spaine; in ≈øo honourable an a≈ø≈øembly, to ≈øeeke the thraldome of his Kings Crowne, to play the captious in cauilling about cau≈øes of his Kings depo≈øing, to giue his former life the Lye with ≈øhame enough in his old aage, and to make him≈øelfe a common by-word, vnder the name of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematicall Martyr;</hi> one that offers him≈øelfe to fagot and fire, for a point of doctrine but problematically handled, that is, di≈øtru≈øtfully and onely by way of doubtfull and que≈øtionable di≈øcour≈øe: yea for a point of doctrine, in which the French (as he pretendeth) are permitted to thwart and cro≈ø≈øe his Holines in iudgement, prouided they ≈øpeake in it as in a point, not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and nece≈ø≈øary, but onely doubtfull and probable.</p>

                  <p>Now to mount ≈øo high, and to flie in ≈øuch place vpon the wings of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification for this Inconuenience, what is it el≈øe but magnifically to report and imagine a mi≈øchiefe by many degrees greater then the mi≈øchiefe is? The L. Cardinal is in a great errour, if hee make him≈øelfe beleeue, that other nations wil make a rent or ≈øeparation from the communion of the French, becau≈øe the French ≈øtand to it tooth and naile, that French Crownes are not liable or obnoxious to Papall depo≈øition; how≈øoeuer there is no ≈øchi≈øme that importeth not ≈øeparation of communion.

No ≈øuch matter. When the L.

Nay, his Lord≈øhip telleth vs him≈øelfe a little after, that his Holine≈ø≈øe giues the French free ≈øcope, to maintaine either the affirmatiue or negatiue of this que≈øtion. And will his Holine≈ø≈øe hold them ≈øchi≈ømatikes, that di≈ø≈øent from his opinion and iudgement in a ≈øubiect or cau≈øe e≈øteemed proble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall?

But being well a≈ø≈øured the Pope ≈øtandeth in greater feare of his arme, then hee doeth of the Popes head and
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:23110:248"/>≈øhoulders, he neuer troubles his owne head about our que≈øtion. More, when the booke of Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> was come foorth, in which booke the Kingdome of Naples is de≈øcried and publiquely di≈øcredited (like fal≈øe money) touching the qualitie of a Kingdome, and attributed to the King of Spaine, not as trew proprietary thereof, but onely as an E≈øtate held in fee of the Romane Church; the King made no bones to condemne and to bani≈øh the ≈øaid booke out of his dominions. The holy Father was conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to put vp his Catholike ≈øonnes proceeding to the Cardinals di≈øgrace, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer opened his mouth again≈øt the King, neuer declared or noted the King to be ≈øchi≈ømaticall. He waits perhaps for ≈øome fitter opportunitie; when the Kingdome of Spaine groaning vnder the burthens of inte≈øtine di≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and troubles, hee may without any danger to him≈øelfe giue the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike King a Bi≈øhops mate. Yea, the L.

                  <p>What needed the L.

We can erect and ≈øet vp no trophey more honorable for heretikes in token of their victory, then to auow that Chri≈øts vi≈øible Kingdom is peri≈øhed from the face of the earth, and that for ≈øo many hundred yeres there hath not bene any Temple of God, nor any ≈øpou≈øe of Chri≈øt, but euery where, and all the world ouer, the kingdom of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chri≈øt, the ≈øynagogue of Satan, the ≈øpou≈øe of the diuel, hath mightily preuailed and borne all the ≈øway.

                  </p>
                  <p>Mee thinkes the L. Cardinal in the whole draught and cour≈øe of the≈øe words doeth ≈øeeke not a little to blemi≈øh the honour of his Church, and to marke his religion with a blacke coale: For the whole frame of his Mother-Church is very ea≈øie to be ≈øhaken, if by the e≈øtabli≈øhing of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle ≈øhe ≈øhall come to finall ruine, and ≈øhall become the Synagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Likewi≈øe, Kings are brought into a very mi≈øerable ≈øtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if their Souereigntie ≈øhall not ≈øtand, if they ≈øhall not bee without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of depo≈øition, but by the totall ruine of the Church, and by holding the Pope, whom they ≈øerue, to be Antichri≈øt. The L. Cardinall him≈øelfe (let him be well ≈øifted) herein doeth not credit his owne words: For doeth not his Lord≈øhip tell vs plaine, that neither by Diuine te≈øtimony, nor by any ≈øentence of the ancient Church, the knot of this controuer≈øie hath bene vntied? againe, that ≈øome of the French, by the Popes fauourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, are licen≈øed or tolerated to ≈øay their mind, to deliuer their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this que≈øtion, though contrary to the iudgement of his Holine≈ø≈øe; prouided they hold it onely as problematicall, and not as nece≈ø≈øary? What? Can there be any a≈ø≈øurance for the Pope, that hee is not Antichri≈øt; for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ≈øhe is not a Synagogue of Satan, when a mans a≈ø≈øurance is grounded vpon wauering and wilde vncertainties, without Canon of Scripture, without con≈øent or countenance of antiquitie, and in a cau≈øe which the Pope by good leaue ≈øuffereth ≈øome to to≈ø≈øe with winds of problematicall opinion? It hath beene ≈øhewed before, that by Gods word, whereof ≈ømall reckoning perhaps is made, by venerable anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and by the French Church in tho≈øe times when the Popes power was mounted aloft, the doctrine which teacheth depo≈øing of Kings by the Pope, hath bene checked and countermanded. What, did the French in tho≈øe dayes beleeue the Church was then ≈øwallowed vp, and no where vi≈øible or extant in the world? No verely; Tho≈øe that make the Pope of Soueraigne authoritie for matters of Faith, are not per≈øwaded that in this cau≈øe they are bound ab≈øolutely to beleeue and credit his doctrine. Why ≈øo? Becau≈øe they take it not for any decree or determination of Faith; but for a point perteining to the my≈øteries of State, and a pillar of the Popes Temporall Monarchie; who hath not receiued any promi≈øe from God, that in cau≈øes of this nature hee ≈øhall not erre: For they hold, that errour by no meanes can crawle or ≈øcramble vp to the Papall See, ≈øo highly moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but grant ambition can ≈øcale the highe≈øt walls, and climbe the loftie≈øt pinacles of the ≈øame See. They hold withall, that in ca≈øe of ≈øo ≈øpeciall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage to the Pope, whereby he is made King of Kings, and as it were the pay-ma≈øter or di≈øtributer of Crownes, it is again≈øt all rea≈øon that hee ≈øhould ≈øit as Iudge, to carue out Kingdomes for his owne ≈øhare. To bee ≈øhort, let his Lord≈øhip be a≈ø≈øured that he meeteth with notorious blocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, more blunt-witted then a whet≈øtone, when they are drawen to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:23110:249"/>by his per≈øwa≈øion, that who≈øoeuer beleeues the Pope hath no right nor power to put Kings be≈øide their Thrones, to giue and take away Crownes, are all excluded and barred out of the heauenly Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>But now followes a wor≈øe matter: For they whom the Cardinall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully calls heretikes, haue wrought and wonne his Lord≈øhip (as to mee ≈øeemeth) to plead their cau≈øe at the barre, and to betray his owne cau≈øe to the≈øe heretikes: For what is it in his Lord≈øhip, but plaine playing the Praeuaricator, when he crieth ≈øo lowd, that by admitting and e≈øtabli≈øhing of this Article, the doctrine of Cake-incarnation and priuie Confe≈ø≈øion to a Prie≈øt, is vtterly ≈øubuerted? Let vs heare his rea≈øon, and willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the trewth from his lips. The Articles (as his Lord≈øhip granteth) of Tran≈øub≈øtantiation, auricular Confe≈ø≈øion, and the Popes power to depo≈øe Kings, are all grounded alike vpon the ≈øame authoritie. Now he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Article of the Popes power to depo≈øe Kings, is not deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Scripture, nor by the ancient Church, but within the compa≈ø≈øe of certaine aages pa≈øt, by the authoritie of Popes and Councils. Then he goes on well, and inferres with good rea≈øon, that in ca≈øe the point of the Popes power be weakened, then the other two points mu≈øt needs bee ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ea≈øily ouerthrowen: So that hee doeth confe≈ø≈øe the mon≈øtrous birth of the breaden-God, and the blind Sacrament or vaine fanta≈øie of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular confe≈ø≈øion, are no more conueyed into the Church by pipes from the ≈øprings of ≈øacred Scripture, or from the riuers of the ancient Church, then that other point of the Popes power ouer Kings and their Crownes. Very good: For were they indeed deriued from either of tho≈øe two heads, that is to ≈øay, were they grounded vpon the foundation of the fir≈øt or ≈øecond authoritie; then they could neuer bee ≈øhaken by the downefall of the Popes power to depo≈øe Kings. I am well a≈ø≈øured, that for v≈øing ≈øo good a rea≈øon, the world will hold his Lord≈øhip in ≈øu≈øpicion, that he ≈øtill hath ≈øome≈ømacke of his fathers di≈øcipline and in≈øtruction, who in times pa≈øt had the honour to be a Mini≈øter of the holy Go≈øpel.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit he playeth not faire, nor v≈øeth ≈øincere dealing in his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding again≈øt ≈øuch as he calls heretikes; when hee ca≈øts in their di≈øh, and beares them in hand they frowardly wrangle for the inui≈øibilitie of the Church in earth: For indeed the matter is nothing ≈øo. They freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a vi≈øible Church: For how≈øoeuer the a≈ø≈øembly of Gods elect, doth make a body not di≈øcerneable by mans eye; yet we a≈ø≈øuredly beleeue, and gladly profe≈ø≈øe, there neuer wanted a vi≈øible Church in the world; yet onely vi≈øible to ≈øuch as make a part of the ≈øame. All that are without, ≈øee no more but men, they doe not ≈øee the ≈øaid men to be the trew Church. Wee beleeue moreouer of the vniuer≈øall Church vi≈øible, that it is compo≈øed of many particular Churches, whereof ≈øome are better fined and more cleane from lees and dregs then other: and withall, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the pure≈øt Churches to be alwayes the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt and mo≈øt vi≈øible.</p>

Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the latter of which two Kings, his Lord≈øhip ≈øaith in a ≈øtraine of boa≈øting, after this manner: <hi>I, by the grace of God, or the grace of God by mee rather, reduced him to the Catholike religion. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at Rome his ab≈øolution of Pope Clement</hi> 8. <hi>I reconciled him to the holy See.</hi> Touching the fir≈øt of the≈øe points; I ≈øay the time, the occa≈øions, and the fore≈øaid Kings nece≈ø≈øary affaires doe ≈øufficiently te≈øtifie, that he was indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to change his mind, and to alter his religion, vpon the ≈øtrength of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of arguments then Theologicall ≈øchooles, or the per≈øwa≈øions of the L.

Moreouer, who doeth not know, that in affaires of ≈øo high na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and con≈øequence, re≈øolutions once taken, Princes are to proceede with in≈øtructions by a formall cour≈øe? As for the Kings ab≈øolution, pretended to bee purcha≈øed of <hi>Clement</hi> 8. by the L. Cardinals good ≈øeruice; it had beene the part of ≈øo great a Cardinall, for the honour of his King, of the Realme, and of his owne place, to haue buried that piece of his notable ≈øeruice in perpetuall ≈øilence, and in the darke night of eternall obliuion: For in this matter of reconcilement, it is not vnknowne to the world, how ≈øhamefully and ba≈øely hee pro≈øtituted the inuiolable dignity of his King, when his Lord≈øhip repre≈øenting the per≈øon of his King, and couching on the ground by way of ≈øufficient penance, was glad (as I haue noted in the Preface to my Apologie) to haue his venerable ≈øhoulders gracefully ≈øaluted with ≈øtripes, and reuerently wor≈øhipped with ba≈øtonados of a Pontificiall cudgell. Which gracefull, or di≈øgracefull blemi≈øh rather, it plea≈øed Pope <hi>Clement</hi> of his rare clemencie, to grace yet with a higher degree of ≈øpirituall graces; in giuing the L. Cardinall then Bi≈øhop of <hi>Eureux,</hi> a certaine quantity of holy graines, cro≈ø≈øes, and medals, or little plates of ≈øiluer, or ≈øome other mettall, to hang about the necke, or to bee borne about again≈øt ≈øome euill: Which trea≈øures of the Popes grace, who≈øoeuer ≈øhould graciou≈øly and reuerently ki≈ø≈øe, they ≈øhould without faile purcha≈øe vnto them≈øelues a pardon for one hundred yeeres. The≈øe feate and prety gugawes for children, were no doubt a ≈øpeciall comfort vnto the good Kings heart, after his Maie≈øtie had beene hand≈øomely ba≈øted vpon the L. Bi≈øhops backe. But with what face can his Lord≈øhip brag, that he preuailed with Pope <hi>Clement</hi> for the Kings ab≈øolution? The late Duke of <hi>Neuers,</hi> not long before had ≈øolicited his
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:23110:250"/>Holines, with all earne≈øt and humble in≈øtance to the ≈øame purpo≈øe; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoeuer, the Kings affaires then ≈øeeming de≈øperate in the Popes eye, he was licen≈øed to depart for <hi>France,</hi> without any due and gracious re≈øpect vnto his errand. But ≈øo ≈øoone as the Pope receiued intelligence, of the Kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes growing to the full, and the affaires of the League to be in the wane, and the principall cities, the ≈øtronge≈øt places of garri≈øon through all <hi>France</hi> to ≈øtrike tops and tops gallant, and to hale the King; then the holy Gho≈øt in good time in≈øpired the holy Father with a holy de≈øire and tender affection, to receiue this poore wandring ≈øheep againe into the flocke of Chri≈øt, and bo≈øome of holy Church. His Holine≈ø≈øe had rea≈øon: For he feared by his ob≈øtinate ≈øeuerity to prouoke the patience of the French, and to driue that Nation (as they had many times threatned before) then to put in execution their auncient de≈øigne; which was, to ≈øhake off the Pope, and to ≈øet vp ≈øome of their owne tribes or kinreds for Patriarch ouer the French Church. But let his Lord≈øhippe vouch≈øafe to ≈øearch the ≈øecret of his owne bo≈øome, and no doubt he wil not ≈øticke to acknowledge, that before he ≈øtirred one foote out of <hi>France,</hi> he had good a≈ø≈øurance of the good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe and i≈ø≈øue of his honourable emba≈ø≈øage.</p>
                  <p>Now the hearers thus prepared by his Preface, the L. Cardinall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in his purpo≈øe; namely to make proofe, how this Article of the third E≈øtate, wherein doubtfull and que≈øtionable matters are mingled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with certaine and indubitable principles, doth ≈øo debilitate and weaken the ≈øinewes and vertue of any remedy intended for the danger of Kings, as it maketh all remedies and receipts pre≈øcribed for that purpo≈øe, to become altogether vnprofitable, and without effect. He yeelds this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, (take it for≈øooth vpon my warrant) a rea≈øon full of pith and ≈øub≈øtance: The onely remedie again≈øt parricides, is to thunder the ≈øolemne cur≈øes of the Church, and the puni≈øhments to be inflicted after death: which points, if they be not grounded vpon infallible authoritie, will neuer be ≈øetled in mens per≈øwa≈øions with any certaine a≈ø≈øurance. Now in the ≈øolemne cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of the Church, no man can attaine to the ≈øaid a≈ø≈øurance, if things not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied be mingled with points not graunted, and not con≈øented vnto by the Vniuer≈øall Church. By a thing not denied and not conte≈øted, the L. Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall meanes prohibiting and condemning of King-killing: and by points conte≈øted, he meanes denying of the Popes power to depo≈øe Kings.</p>
                  <p>In this whole di≈øcour≈øe, I find neither pith of argument, nor cour≈øe of proofe; but onely a ca≈øt of the L. Cardinalls office by way of coun≈øell: whereunto I make this an≈øwere. If there be in this Article of the third E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtate any point, wherein all are not of one mind and the ≈øame iudgement; in whom lieth all the blame, from whence ri≈øes the doubt, but from the Popes and Popi≈øh para≈øites, by whom the certaintie of the ≈øaid point hath bin cunningly remooued and conueied away, and mu≈øt be re≈øtored againe by publike authority? Now the way to re≈øtore certainty vnto a point, which again≈øt rea≈øon is called into doubt and que≈øtion, is to make it vp in one
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:23110:251"/>ma≈ø≈øe, or to tie it vp in the ≈øame bundle, with other certaine points of the ≈øame nature.</p>
                  <p>Here I am forced to ≈øummon the con≈øciences of men, to make ≈øome ≈øtand or ≈øtay vpon this point, and with me to enter into deepe con≈øideration, how great and vnuanqui≈øhable force is euer found in the trewth: For the≈øe two que≈øtions, Whether Kings may lawfully be made away by a≈ø≈øa≈ø≈øins waged and hired for the act; and Whether the Pope hath lawfull power to cha≈øe Kings out of their Thrones, are by the L. Cardinals owne confe≈ø≈øion, in ≈øo full a≈øpect of coniunction, that if either bee brought vnder any degree of doubt, the other al≈øo is fetcht within the ≈øame compa≈ø≈øe. In which words he directly pointeth as with a finger to the very trew ≈øource of the maine mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, and to the ba≈øilique and liuer veine, infected with pe≈øtilential blood, inflamed to the de≈øtruction of Ba≈øilicall Princes by dete≈øtable parricide: For who≈øoeuer ≈øhall confidently beleeue that Popes are not armed with power to depo≈øe Kings; will beleeue with no le≈ø≈øe confidence and a≈ø≈øurance, it is not lawful by ≈øudden a≈ø≈øaults to flie at their throats. For are not all de≈øperate villaines per≈øwaded, when they are hired to murder Kings, that in doing ≈øo damnable a feate, they doe it for a piece of notable and extraordinary ≈øeruice to the Pope? This maxime therfore is to be held for a principle vnmoouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and indubitable; that, If ≈øubiects de≈øire the life of their Kings to bee ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; they mu≈øt not yeeld the Pope one inch of power, to depriue their Kings of their Thrones and Crownes, by depo≈øing their Kings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Lord Cardinall te≈øtifieth no le≈ø≈øe him≈øelfe in the≈øe words: <hi>If tho≈øe mon≈øters of men, and furies of hell, by whom the life-blood of our two la≈øt Kings was let out, had euer beene acquainted with Lawes Eccle≈øia≈øticall, they might haue read them≈øelues adiudged by the Councill of Con≈øtance to expre≈ø≈øe damnation.</hi>
                     </q> For in the≈øe words, the L. Cardinall preferreth a bill of inditement to ca≈øt his Holine≈ø≈øe; who, vpon the commencing of the Leaguers warres, in ≈øtead of giuing order for the publi≈øhing of the ≈øaid Eccle≈øia≈øticall Lawes for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtraining of all parricidicall practi≈øes and attempts, fell to the terrour of his fulminations, which not long after were ≈øeconded and ratified by the mo≈øt audatious and bloody murder of King <hi>Henry</hi> III. In like manner, the whole Clergy of <hi>France</hi> are wrapped vp by the L. Cardinals words, and inuolued in the perill of the ≈øaid inditement: For in ≈øtead of preaching the ≈øaid Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øia≈øticall Lawes, by which all King-killing is inhibited; the Prie≈øts taught, vented, and publi≈øhed nothing but rebellion; and when the people in great deuotion came to powre their confe≈ø≈øions into the Prie≈øts eares; then the Prie≈øts, with a kind of counterbuffe in the ≈øecond place when their turne was come, and with greater deuotion, powred blood into the eares of the people; out of which roote grewe the terrour of tho≈øe cruell warres, and the horrible parricide of that good King.</p>
                  <p>But let vs here take ≈øome neere ≈øight of the≈øe Eccle≈øia≈øticall Lawes, whereby ≈øubiects are inhibited to kill, or de≈øperately to di≈øpatch their Kings out of the way. The Lord Cardinall, for full payment of all ≈øcores
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:23110:251"/>vpon this reckoning, layeth downe the credit of the Councill at <hi>Con≈øtance,</hi> which neuerthele≈ø≈øe affoardeth not one myte of trew and currant pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The trewth of the hi≈øtory may bee taken from this briefe relation. <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Burgundy, procured <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of Orleans to be murthered in Paris: To iu≈øtifie and make good this bloody acte, he produced a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine petima≈øter, one called by the name of <hi>Iohn Petit.</hi> This little <hi>Iohn</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed nine propo≈øitions to be giuen foorth or ≈øet vp, to bee di≈øcu≈ø≈øed in the famous Vniuer≈øitie of Paris: The ≈øumme of all to this purpo≈øe; It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, iu≈øt, and honourable, for euery ≈øubiect or priuate per≈øon either by open force and violence, or by deceit and ≈øecret lying in waite, or by ≈øome wittie ≈øtratagem, or by any other way of fact, to kil a Tyrant practi≈øing again≈øt his King, and other higher powers; yea the King ought in rea≈øon, to giue him a pen≈øion or ≈øtipend, that hath killed any per≈øon di≈øloyal to his Prince. The words of <hi>Petits</hi> fir≈øt propo≈øition be the≈øe: <hi>It is lawfull for euery ≈øubiect,
<note place="margin">Ger≈øon.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any command or commi≈øsion from the higher powers by all the Lawes of nature, of man, and of God him≈øelfe, to kill or cau≈øe to be killed any Tyrant, who either by a couetous and greedie de≈øire, or by fraud, by diuination vpon casting of Lots, by double and treacherous dealing, doeth plot or practi≈øe against his Kings corporall health, or the health of his higher powers.</hi> In the third propo≈øition: <hi>It is lawfull for euery ≈øubiect honourable and meritorious, to kill the ≈øaid Tyrant, or cau≈øe him to be killed as a Traitor, di≈øloyall and trecherous to his King.</hi> In the ≈øixt propo≈øition: <hi>The King is to appoint a ≈øalarie and recompence for him that hath killed ≈øuch a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or hath cau≈øed him to bee killed.</hi> The≈øe propo≈øitions of <hi>Iohannes Paruus,</hi> were condemned by the Councill of Con≈øtance, as impious, and tending to the ≈øcandall of the Church. Now then, whereas the ≈øaid Councill no doubt vnder≈øtood the name or word Tyrant in the ≈øame ≈øen≈øe, wherein it was taken by <hi>Iohannes Paruus;</hi> certaine it is, the Councill was not of any ≈øuch iudgement or mind, to condemne one that ≈øhould kill a King or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Prince; but one that by trea≈øon, and without commandement ≈øhould kill a ≈øubiect, rebelling and practi≈øing again≈øt his King. For <hi>Iohn Petit</hi> had vndertaken to iu≈øtifie the making away of the Duke of Orleans to be a lawfull acte, and calls that Dukea Tyrant, albeit hee was no Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Prince; as all the aboue recited words of <hi>Iohn Petit</hi> doe te≈øtifie, that he ≈øpeaketh of ≈øuch a Tyrant, as being in ≈øtate of ≈øubiection, rebelleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt his free and ab≈øolute Prince: So that who≈øoeuer ≈øhall narrowly ≈øearch and looke into the mind and meaning of the ≈øaid Council, ≈øhal ea≈øily perceiue, that by their decrees the ≈øafetie of Kings was not confirmed but weakened, not augmented but dimini≈øhed; for as much as they inhibited priuate per≈øons to kill a Subiect, attempting by wicked coun≈øels and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øes to make away his King.</p>
                  <p>But be it granted, the Councill of Con≈øtance is flat and altogether direct again≈øt King-killers; For I am not vnwilling to be per≈øwaded, that had the que≈øtion then touched the murdering of Soueraigne Princes, the ≈øaid Councill would haue pa≈ø≈øed a ≈øound and holy decree: But, I ≈øay, this gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:23110:252"/>what ≈øheild of defence is hereby reached to Kings, to ward or beat off the thru≈øt of a murderers weapon, and to ≈øaue or ≈øecure their life? ≈øeeing the L. Cardinall, building vpon the ≈øubtile deui≈øe and ≈øhift of the <hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> hath taught vs out of their Schooles, that by Kings are vnder≈øtood Kings in <hi>e≈ø≈øe,</hi> not yet fallen from the ≈øupreame degree of Soueraigne Royaltie: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once depo≈øed by the Pope, (≈øay the <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi>) they are no longer Kings, but are fallen from the rights of Soueraigne dignitie; and con≈øequently to make ≈øtrip and wa≈øt of their blood, is not for≈øooth to make ≈øtrip and wa≈øt of Royall blood. The <hi>Ie≈øuiticall</hi> ma≈øters, in the file of their words are ≈øo ≈øupple and ≈øo limber, that by leauing ≈øtill in their ≈øpeech ≈øome ≈øtarting hole or other, they are able by the ≈øame, as by a po≈øterne or backdoore, to make an e≈øcape.</p>
                  <p>Meane while the Readers are here to note (for well they may) a tricke of mon≈øtrous and mo≈øt wicked cunning. The L. Cardinall contends for the bridling and hampering of King-killers by the Lawes Eccle≈øia≈øticall. Now it might be pre≈øumed, that ≈øo reuerend and learned a Cardinal inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to make v≈øe of Eccle≈øia≈øticall Lawes, by vertue whereof the life of Kings may be ≈øecured, would fill his mouth and garni≈øh the point with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Oracles, that wee might the more gladly and willingly giue him the hearing, when hee ≈øpeakes as one furni≈øhed with ≈øufficient weight and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of ≈øacred Scripture. But behold, in ≈øtead of the authenticall and mo≈øt ancient word, hee propounds the decree of a lateborne Councill at Con≈øtance, neither for the Popes tooth, nor any way comming neere the point in controuer≈øie. And ≈øuppo≈øe it were pertinent vnto the purpo≈øe, the L. Cardinall beareth in his hand a forke of di≈øtinction, with two tines or teeth to beare off, nay to ≈øhift off and to auoid the matter with meere dalliance. The ≈øhorte≈øt and neere≈øt way (in ≈øome ≈øort of re≈øpects) to e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øh a fal≈øe opinion, is to charge or ≈øet vpon it with fal≈øe and with ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous rea≈øons. The like way to worke the ouerthrow of trew doctrine, is to re≈øt or ground it vpon friuolous rea≈øons or authorities of ≈øtubble-weight. For example; if we ≈øhould thus argue for the immortalitie of the ≈øoule with <hi>Plato:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Phaedone.</note> The ≈øwan ≈øingeth before her death; <hi>ergo,</hi> the ≈øoule is immortall. Or thus with certaine ≈øeduced Chri≈øtians: The Pope hath ordained the word of God to be authenticall: <hi>ergo,</hi> all credit mu≈øt be giuen to diuine Scripture. Vpon the ≈øpurkies or hookes of ≈øuch ridiculous arguments and friuolous rea≈øons, the L. Cardinall hangs the life and ≈øafetie of Kings.</p>
                  <p>With like artificiall deui≈øes hee pretendeth to haue the infamous mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and appo≈øted cutting of Kings throats in extreame dete≈øtation; and yet by depo≈øing them from their Princely dignities, by degrading them from their ≈øupreame and Soueraigne authorities, hee brings their ≈øacred heads to the butchers blocke: For a King depo≈øed by the Pope, (let no man doubt) will not leaue any ≈øtone vnremooued, nor any meanes and wayes vnattempted, nor any forces or powers of men vnleuied or vnhired, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him≈øelfe and his Regall dignitie, to repre≈ø≈øe and bring vnder his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious

In this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie of the publike affaires, in the≈øe tempe≈øtuous perturbations of the State, with what perils is the King not be≈øieged and a≈ø≈øaulted? His head is expo≈øed to the chances of warre; his life a faire marke to the in≈øidious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øes of a thou≈øand traitours; his Royall per≈øon obuious to the dreadfull ≈øtorme of angry fortune, to the deadly malice, to the fatall and mortall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of his enemies. The rea≈øon: He is pre≈øuppo≈øed to be lawfully and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly ≈øtripped of his Kingdome. Wil he yet hold the ≈øterne of his Royall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtate? Then is he nece≈ø≈øarily taken for a Tyrant, reputed an v≈øurper, and his life is expo≈øed to the ≈øpoile: For the publike lawes make it lawful and free, for any priuate per≈øon to enterpri≈øe again≈øt an v≈øurper of the Kingdome: <hi>Euery man,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Tertullian, is a ≈øouldier,

He may be depriued by the Pope of a third part, when his Holine≈ø≈øe will haue them turne Clerics or enter Cloi≈øters, without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King leaue: and ≈øo of ≈øubiects they may be made non-≈øubiects.</p>
                  <p>But I que≈øtion yet further. A King falling into here≈øie, is depo≈øed by the Pope; his ≈øonne ≈øtands pure Catholike; The Regal ≈øeat is empty. Who ≈øhall ≈øucceed in the depo≈øed Kings place? Shall a ≈øtranger be preferred by the Pope? That were to doe the innocent ≈øonne egregious and notorious wrong. Shall the ≈øonne him≈øelfe? That were a more iniurious part in the ≈øonne again≈øt his father: For if the ≈øonne bee touched with any feare of God, or mooued with any reuerence towards his father, hee will diligently and ≈øeriou≈øly take heed, that hee put not his father by the Kingdome, by who≈øe meanes he him≈øelfe is borne to a Kingdome. Nor will hee tread in the ≈øteps of <hi>Henry</hi> the V. Emperour, who by the Popes in≈øtigation, expelled and cha≈øed his aaged father out of the Imperiall dignitie.

                  <p>All the≈øe things are nothing in a maner, if we compare them with the la≈øt clau≈øe, which is the clo≈øer, and as it were the vp≈øhot of his Lord≈øhips di≈øcour≈øe: For therein he laboureth to per≈øwade concerning this Article, framed to bridle the Popes tyrannicall power ouer Kings, if it ≈øhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue gracious entertainement, and generall approbation; <q>
                        <hi>That it would breed great danger, and worke effects of pernicious con≈øequence vnto Kings.</hi> The rea≈øon: <hi>becau≈øe it would prooue an introduction to ≈øchi≈øme; and ≈øchi≈øme would ≈øtirre vp ciuil warres, contempt of Kings, distempered inclinations and motions to intrap their life; and which is wor≈øt of all, the fierce wrath of God, inflicting all ≈øorts of calamities.</hi>
                     </q> An admirable paradoxe, and able to ≈øtrike men ≈øtone-blind: that his Holine≈ø≈øe mu≈øt haue power to depo≈øe Kings, for the better ≈øecurity and ≈øafegard of their life; that when their Crownes are made ≈øubiect vnto anothers will and plea≈øure, then they are come to the highe≈øt altitude and eleuation of honour; that for the onely warrant of their life, their ≈øupreme and ab≈øolute greatne≈ø≈øe mu≈øt be depre≈ø≈øed; that for the longer keeping of their Crownes, another mu≈øt plucke the Crowne from their heads.

                  <p>All this Artificiall and ≈øwelling di≈øcour≈øe like vnto puffe-pa≈øt, if it be viewed at a neere di≈øtance, will be found like a bladder full of wind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ≈øoliditie of ≈øub≈øtantiall matter. For the Deputies of the third
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:23110:257"/>E≈øtate were neuer ≈øo voide of vnder≈øtanding, to beleeue that by prouiding for the life and ≈øafety of their King, they ≈øhould thru≈øt him headlong into eternall damnation.

                  <p>And whereas he is bold to pronounce, that heretikes of <hi>France</hi> doe make their benefit and aduantage of this diui≈øion; that ≈øpeech is grounded vpon this propo≈øition; That profe≈ø≈øors of the Chri≈øtian Religion reformed (which is to ≈øay, purged and clean≈øed of all Popi≈øh dregs) are heretikes in fact, and ought ≈øo to bee reputed in right: Which propo≈øition his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip will neuer ≈øoundly and ≈øufficiently make good, before his Holine≈ø≈øe hath compiled an other Go≈øpell, or hath forged an other Bible at his Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall anuile. The L. Cardinall vndertooke to reade mee a lecture vpon that argument; but euer ≈øince hath played Mum-budget, and hath put him≈øelfe to ≈øilence, like one at a Non-plus in his enterpri≈øe. There be three yeeres already gone and pa≈øt, ≈øince his Lord≈øhip beganne to ≈øhape ≈øome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwere to a certaine writing di≈øpatched by mee in few daies: With forming and reforming, with filing and poli≈øhing, with labouring and licking his an≈øwere ouer and ouer againe, with reiterated extractions and calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, it may be coniectured that all his Lord≈øhips labour and co≈øt is long ≈øince evaporated and vani≈øhed in the aire. Howbeit, as well the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conference of a King, (for I will not call it a contention) as al≈øo the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, excellencie, and importance of the matter, long ≈øince de≈øerued, and as long ≈øince required the publi≈øhing of ≈øome or other an≈øwere. His Lord≈øhips long ≈øilence will neuer be imputed to lacke of capacity, wherewith who knoweth not how abundantly he is furni≈øhed; but rather to well adui≈øed agnition of his owne working and building vpon a weake foundation.</p>
                  <p>But let vs returne vnto the≈øe heretikes, that make ≈øo great gaine by the di≈øagreement of Catholikes. It is no part of their dutie to aime at ≈øowing of di≈ø≈øentions; but rather to intend and attend their faithfull performance of ≈øeruice to their King. If ≈øome be plea≈øed, and others offended, when ≈øo good and loyall duties are ≈øincerely di≈øcharged; it is for all good ≈øubiects to grieue and to be ≈øory, that when they ≈øpeake for the ≈øafetie of their King &amp; honour of the trewth, it is their hard hap to leaue any at all vn≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. But ≈øuppo≈øe the ≈øaid heretiks were the Authors of this article preferred by the third E≈øtate: What need they to conceale their names in that regard? What need they to di≈øclaime the credit of ≈øuch a worthy act? Would it not redound to their perpetuall honour, to be the onely ≈øubiects that kept watch ouer the Kings life and Crowne, that ≈øtood centinell, and walked the rounds for the pre≈øeruation of his Princely diademe, when all other had no more touch, no more feeling thereof then ≈øo many ≈øtones? And what neede the Deputies for the third E≈øtate, to receiue in≈øtructions from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Kingdomes, concerning a cau≈øe of that nature; when there was
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:23110:257"/>no want of dome≈øticall examples, and the French hi≈øtories were plentifull in that argument? What neede they to gape for this reformed doctrine, to come ≈øwimming with a fi≈øhes tayle out of an I≈øland to the mayne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, when they had before their eyes the murders of two Kings, with diuer≈øe ciuill warres, and many Arre≈øts of Court, all tending to in≈øinuate and ≈øugge≈øt the introduction of the ≈øame remedy? Sugge≈øtions are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe from abroad, when the mi≈øchiefe is felt at home. it ≈øeemes to me that his Lord≈øhip in ≈ømoothing and tickling the Deputies for the third E≈øtate, doth no le≈ø≈øe then wring and wrong their great ≈øufficiencie with contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and outragious abu≈øe; as if they were not furni≈øhed with ≈øufficient fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øight, and with loyall affection towards their King, for the pre≈øeruation of his life and honour, if the remedie were not beaten into their heads by tho≈øe of the Religion, reputed heretikes.</p>
                  <p>Touching my ≈øelfe, ranged by his Lord≈øhip in the ≈øame ranke with ≈øowers of di≈ø≈øention; I take my God to witnes, and my owne con≈øcience, that I neuer dream'd of any ≈øuch vnchri≈øtian proiect. It hath beene hitherto my ordinary cour≈øe to follow hone≈øt coun≈øells, and to walke in open waies. I neuer wonted my ≈øelfe to holes and corners, to crafty ≈øhifts, but euermore to plaine and open de≈øignes. I neede not hide mine intentions for feare of any mortall man, that puffeth breath of life out of his no≈øtrils. Nor in any ≈øort doe I purpo≈øe, to ≈øet <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apo≈øtata before mine eyes, as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for me to follow. <hi>Iulian</hi> of a Chri≈øtian became a Pagan: I profe≈ø≈øe the ≈øame faith of Chri≈øt ≈øtill, which I haue euer profe≈ø≈øed: <hi>Iulian</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his de≈øignes with crafty conueiances; I neuer with any of his capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and cunning ≈øleights: <hi>Iulian</hi> forced his ≈øubiects to infidelitie again≈øt I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt; I labour to induce my ≈øubiects vnto ≈øuch tearmes of loyalty towards my ≈øelfe, as Ie≈øus Chri≈øt hath pre≈øcribed and taught in his word. But how farre I differ from <hi>Iulian,</hi> it is to be ≈øeene more at large in my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwere to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Epi≈øtles written to <hi>Blackwell;</hi> from whence the Lord Cardinall borrowing this example, it might well haue be≈øeemed his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip to borrow likewi≈øe my an≈øwere from the ≈øame place.</p>
                  <p>Now as it mooues me nothing at all, to be drawne by his Lord≈øhip into ≈øu≈øpitions of this nature and qualitie: ≈øo by the pray≈øes, that he rockes me withall, I will neuer be lulled a≈øleepe. To commend a man for his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and withall to take from him the feare of God, is to admire a ≈øouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for his goodly head of haire or his curled locks, and withall to call him ba≈øe coward, faint-hearted and fre≈øh-water ≈øouldier. Knowledge, wit, and learning in an hereticke, are of none other v≈øe and ≈øeruice, but only to make him the more culpable, &amp; con≈øequently obnoxious to the more grieuous puni≈øhments. All vertues turne to vices, when they become the ≈øeruants of impietie. The hand-maids which the Soueraigne Lady Wi≈øedome calleth to be of her traine in the 9. Prouerb. are morall vertues, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ≈øciences; which then become pernicious, when they run away from their Soueraigne Lady-Mi≈øtris, and put ouer them≈øelues in ≈øeruice to the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:23110:258"/>diuel. What difference is betweene two men, both alike wanting the knowledge of God; the one furni≈øhed with arts and ciuill vertues, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bruti≈øhly barbarous and of a deformed life, or of prophane maners? What is the difference betweene the≈øe two? I make this the onely difference: the fir≈øt goeth to hell with a better grace, and falleth into perdition with more facilitie, then the ≈øecond: But hee becommeth exceedingly wicked, euen threefold and fourefold abominable, if he wa≈øt his trea≈øure and ≈øtocke of ciuill vertues in per≈øecuting the Church of CHRIST: and if that may be layd in his di≈øh which was ca≈øt in <hi>Cae≈øars</hi> teeth, that in plaine ≈øobernes and well-≈øetled temper, he attempts the ruine of the Common-wealth, which from a drunken ≈øot might receiue perhaps a more ea≈øie fall. In briefe, I ≈øcorne all garlands of prai≈øes, which are not euer greene; but being dry and withered for want of ≈øap and radicall moy≈øture, doe flagge about barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Princes browes. I defie and renounce tho≈øe prai≈øes, which fit mee no more then they fit a <hi>Mahumetane</hi> King of <hi>Marocco.</hi> I conte≈øt again≈øt all prai≈øes which grace me with petie acce≈ø≈øories, but rob me of the principall, that one thing nece≈ø≈øary; namely, the feare and knowledge of my GOD: vnto who≈øe Maie≈øtie alone, I haue deuoted my Scepter, my ≈øword, my penne, my whole indu≈øtrie, my whole ≈øelfe, with all that is mine in whole and in part. I doe it, I doe it in all humble acknowledgement of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpeakable mercie and fauour, who hath vouch≈øafed to deliuer me from the erroneous way of this aage, to deliuer my Kingdome from the Popes ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall yoke, vnder which it hath lyen in times pa≈øt mo≈øt grieuou≈øly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed: My Kingdom where God is now purely ≈øerued, and called vpon in a tongue which all the vulgar vnder≈øtand: My Kingdome, where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may now reade the Scriptures without any ≈øpecial priuiledge from the Apo≈øtolike See, and with no le≈ø≈øe libertie then the people of Ephe≈øus, of Rome, and of Corinth did reade the holy Epi≈øtles, written to their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by <hi>S.

                  <p>But if the L.

If the French king in the heart of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ≈øhould nouri≈øh and fo≈øter ≈øuch a ne≈øt of ≈øtinging hornets and bu≈øie wa≈øps, I meane ≈øuch a pack of ≈øubiects, denying his ab≈øolute Soueraignty, as many Romane Catholiks of my Kingdome do mine: It may wel be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether the L. Cardinal would adui≈øe his king ≈øtil to feather the ne≈øt of the ≈øaid Catholiks, ≈øtil to keep them warme, ≈øtil to beare them with an ea≈øie and gentle hand: It may wel be doubted, whether his Lord≈øhip would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol their con≈øtancie, that would haue the courage to ≈øheath vp their ≈øwords in his Kings bowels, or blow vp his King with gun-powder, into the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øtation of the lowe≈øt regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>: It may wel be doubted, whether he would indure that Orator, who (like as him≈øelfe hath done) ≈øhould ≈øtir vp others to ≈øuffer Martyrdome after ≈øuch examples, and to imitate parricides &amp; traitors in their con≈øtancy. The ≈øcope then of the L.

<pb n="474" facs="tcp:23110:259"/>re≈øolution to depriue me of my life. The rea≈øon: Becau≈øe the plotters and practi≈øers again≈øt my life, are honoured and rewarded with a glorious name of Martyrs: their con≈øtancie (what els?) is admired, when they ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death for trea≈øon. Wheras hitherto during the time of my whole raigne to this day, (I ≈øpeake it in the word of a King, and trewth it ≈øelfe ≈øhall make good the Kings word) no man hath lo≈øt his life, no man hath indured the Racke, no man hath ≈øuffered corporall puni≈øhment in other kinds, meerely or ≈øimply, or in any degree of re≈øpect, for his con≈øcience in matter of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but for wicked con≈øpiring again≈øt my life, or E≈øtate, or Royall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; or els for ≈øome notorious crime, or ≈øome ob≈øtinate and wilfull di≈øobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: Of which traiterous and viperous brood, I commanded one to be hanged by the necke of late in <hi>Scotland;</hi> a Ie≈øuite of intolerable impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, who at his arraignment and publike triall, ≈øtiffely maintained, that I haue robbed the Pope of his right, and haue no manner of right in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of my Kingdome. His Lord≈øhip therefore in offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe to Martyrdome, after the rare example of Catholiks, as he ≈øaith, ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering all ≈øort of puni≈øhment in my Kingdome, doeth plainely profe≈ø≈øe him≈øelfe a follower of traytors and parricides. The≈øe be the Worthies, the≈øe the heroicall ≈øpirits, the≈øe the honourable Captaines and Coronels, who≈øe vertuous parts neuer ≈øufficiently magnified and pray≈øed, his Lord≈øhippe propoundeth for imitation to the <hi>French</hi> Bi≈øhops. O the name of Martyrs, in olde times a ≈øacred name! how is it now derided and ≈øcoffed? how is it in the≈øe daies filthily prophaned? O you the whole quire and holy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Apo≈øtles, who haue ≈øealed the trewth with your deare≈øt blood! how much are you di≈øparaged? how vnfitly are you paragoned and matched, when traytors, bloody butchers, and King-killers are made your a≈ø≈øi≈øtants, and of the ≈øame <hi>Quorum;</hi> or to ≈øpeake in milder tearmes, when you are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with Martyrs that ≈øuffer for maintaining the Temporall rites of the Popes Empire? with Bi≈øhops that offer them≈øelues to a Problematicall Martyrdome, for a point decided neither by the authorities of your Spirit-in≈øpired pens, nor by the auncient and venerable te≈øtimonie of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church? for a point which they dare not vndertake to teach, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe then by a doubtfull, cold, fearefull way of di≈øcour≈øe, and altogether without re≈øolution. In good ≈øooth, I take the Cardinall for a per≈øonage of a quicker ≈øpirit and clearer ≈øight, (let his Lord≈øhip hold mee excu≈øed) then to per≈øwade my ≈øelfe, that in the≈øe matters his tongue and his heart, his pen and his inward iudgement, haue any concord or corre≈øpondence one with another: For beeing very much again≈øt his minde (as hee doeth confe≈ø≈øe) thru≈øt into the office of an Aduocate to pleade this cau≈øe; he ≈øuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe to bee carried (after his engagement) with ≈øome heat, to vtter ≈øome things again≈øt his con≈øcience, murmuring and grumbling the contrary within; and to affirme ≈øome other things with confidence, whereof hee had not beene otherwi≈øe informed, then onely by vaine and lying report. Of which ranke is that bold a≈ø≈øertion of his Lord≈øhip; That many Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:23110:259"/>in England, rather then they would ≈øub≈øcribe to the oath of allegiance in the forme thereof, haue vndergone all ≈øorts of puni≈øhment: For in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (as we haue trewly giuen the whole Chri≈øtian world to vnder≈øtand in our Preface to the Apologie) there is but one forme or kind of puni≈øhment ordained for all ≈øorts of traytors.</p>
                  <p>Hath not his Lord≈øhip now graced me with goodly te≈øtimonialls of pray≈øe and commendation? Am I not by his pray≈øes proclaimed a Tyrant, as it were inebriated with blood of the Saints, and a famous Enginer of torments for my Catholikes? To this exhortation for the ≈øuffering of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, in imitation of my Engli≈øh traytors and parricides, if wee ≈øhall adde; how craftily and ≈øubtilly hee makes the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to hold of the Pope by fealty, and their kingdome in bondage to the Pope by Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall recognizance; it ≈øhall ea≈øily appeare, that his holy-water of pray≈øes wherewith I am ≈øo reuerently be≈øprinkled, is a compo≈øition extracted out of a dram of hony and a pound of gall, fir≈øt ≈øteeped in a ≈øtrong decoction of bitter wormewood, or of the wild gourd called Coloquintida: For after he hath in the beginning of his Oration,

And what may this meaning be, but in plaine tearmes and broad ≈øpeach, to call me v≈øurper and vnlawfull King? For the feudatarie, or he that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a Mannor by fealty, when he doeth not his homage, with all ≈øuit and ≈øeruice that he owes to the Lord <hi>Paramount,</hi> doeth fall from the propertie of his fee. This reproach of the L. Cardinals, is ≈øeconded with an other of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> his brother Cardinall; That <hi>Ireland</hi> was giuen to the Kings of <hi>England</hi> by the Pope. The be≈øt is that his mo≈øt reuerend Lord≈øhip hath not ≈øhewed, who it was that gaue <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Pope.</p>
                  <p>And touching <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> thus in briefe ≈øtands the whole matter. Betweene <hi>Henry</hi> 2. and the Pope had pa≈ø≈øed ≈øundry bickerments, about collating of Eccle≈øia≈øticall dignities. <hi>Iohn</hi> the ≈øonne, after his fathers death, reneweth, vndertaketh, and pur≈øueth the ≈øame quarrell: Driueth certaine <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Bi≈øhops out of the Kingdome, for defending the Popes in≈øolent v≈øurpation vpon his Royall prerogatiue, and Regall rights: Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ≈øuch Princely courage and re≈øolution in tho≈øe times, when all that ≈øtood and ≈øuffered for the Popes Temporall preten≈øions again≈øt Kings, were enrowled Martyrs or Confe≈ø≈øors. The Pope takes the matter in fowle ≈øcorne, and great indignation; ≈øhuts the King by his excommunicatory Bulls out of the Church; ≈øtirres vp his Barons, for other cau≈øes the Kings heauy friends, to ri≈øe in armes; giues the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> (like a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øterle≈ø≈øe man turned ouer to a new ma≈øter) to <hi>Philippus Augustus</hi> King of

By this meanes his Crowne is made tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary, all his people liable to payment of taxes by the poll for a certaine yeerely tribute, and he is ble≈ø≈øed with a pardon for all his ≈øinnes. Whether King <hi>Iohn</hi> was mooued to doe this di≈øhonourable act vpon any deuotion, or inflamed with any zeale of Religion; or inforced by the vnre≈øi≈øtable weapons of nece≈ø≈øitie, who can be ≈øo blind, that he doeth not well ≈øee and clearely perceiue? For to purcha≈øe his owne freedome from this bondage to the Pope; what could he bee vnwilling to doe, that was willing to bring his Kingdome vnder the yoake of <hi>Amirales Murmelinus</hi> a Mahumetan Prince, then King of <hi>Granado</hi> and <hi>Barbaria?</hi> The Pope after that, ≈øent a Legat into <hi>England:</hi> The King now the Popes va≈ø≈øall, and holding his Crowne of the Pope, like a man that holds his land of another by Knights ≈øeruice, or by homage and fealtie, doeth faire homage for his Crowne to the Popes Legat, and layeth downe at his feet a great ma≈ø≈øe of the pure≈øt gold in coyne. The reuerend Legat, in token of his Ma≈øters Soueraigntie, with more then v≈øuall pride falls to kicking and ≈øpurning the trea≈øure, no doubt with a paire of mo≈øt holy feet: Not onely ≈øo; but likewi≈øe at ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne fea≈øts is ea≈øily entreated to take the Kings chaire of E≈øtate. Heere I would faine know the Lord Cardinals opinion; whether the≈øe actions of the Pope were iu≈øt or vniu≈øt, lawfull or vnlawfull, according to right or again≈øt all right and rea≈øon. If he will ≈øay again≈øt right; it is then cleare, that again≈øt right his Lord≈øhip hath made way to this example: if accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to right, let him then make it knowen, from whence or from whom this power was deriued and conueyed to the Pope, whereby hee makes him≈øelfe Souereigne Lord of Temporalties in that Kingdome, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor any of his predece≈ø≈øours euer pretended any right, or layd any claime to Temporall matters before. Are ≈øuch prankes to be played by the Pontificiall Bi≈øhop? Is this an act of Holine≈ø≈øe, to ≈øet a Kingdome on fire by the flaming brands of ≈øedition? to di≈ømember and quarter a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with inte≈øtine warres; onely to this end, that a King once reduced to the lowe≈øt degree of mi≈øerie, might be lifted by his Holine≈ø≈øe out of his Royall prerogatiue, the very ≈øoule and life of his Royall E≈øtate? When began this Papall power? In what aage began the Pope to practi≈øe this power? What! haue the ancient Canons, (for the Scripture in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion beareth no pawme) haue the Canons of the ancient Church impo≈øed
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:23110:260"/>any ≈øuch ≈øatisfaction vpon a ≈øinner, that of a Souereigne and free King, he ≈øhould become va≈ø≈øall to his gho≈øtly Father; that he ≈øhould make him≈øelfe together with all his people and ≈øubiects tributaries to a Bi≈øhop, that ≈øhall rifle a whole Nation of their coine, that ≈øhall receiue homage of a King, and make a King his va≈ø≈øall? What! Shall not a ≈øinner be quitted of his faults, except his Pa≈øtor turne robber, and one that goeth about to get a booty? except hee make his Pa≈øtour a Feoffee in his whole E≈øtate, and ≈øuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe vnder a ≈øhadow of penance to freeze naked, to be turned out of all his goods and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions of inheritance? But be it granted, admit his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe robs one Prince of his rights and reuenewes, to conferre the ≈øame vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another: were it not an high degree of tyrannie to finger another mans e≈øtate, and to giue that away to a third, which the ≈øecond hath no right, no lawfull authoritie to giue? Well, if the Pope then ≈øhall become his owne caruer in the rights of another; if he ≈øhall make his owne coffers to ≈øwell with anothers reuenewes, if he ≈øhall decke and aray his owne backe in the ≈øpoiles of a ≈øinner, with whom in ab≈øolution he maketh peace, and taketh truce; what can this be el≈øe, but running into further degrees of wickedne≈ø≈øe and mi≈øchiefe? what can this be el≈øe, but heaping of robbery vpon fraud, and Impietie vpon robbery? For by ≈øuch deceitfull, craftie, and cunning practi≈øes, the nature of the Pontificiall See, meerely ≈øpirituall, is changed into the Kings-bench-Court, meerely temporall: the Bi≈øhops chaire is changed into a Monarchs Throne. And not onely ≈øo; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides, the ≈øinners repentance is changed into a ≈ønare or pit-fall of cou≈øening deceit; and S. <hi>Peters</hi> net is changed into a ca≈øting-net or a flew, to fi≈øh for all the wealth of mo≈øt flouri≈øhing Kingdomes. Moreouer, the King (a hard ca≈øe) is driuen by ≈øuch wiles and ≈øubtilties, to worke impo≈ø≈øibilities, to acte more then is lawfull or within the compa≈ø≈øe of his power to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øe: For the King neither may in right, nor can by power tran≈ø-nature his Crowne, impaire the Maie≈øtie of his Kingdome, or leaue his Royal dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie le≈ø≈øe free to his heire apparant, or next ≈øucce≈ø≈øor, then he receiued the ≈øame of his predece≈ø≈øour: Much le≈ø≈øe, by any di≈øhonourable capitulations, by any vnworthy contracts, degrade his po≈øteritie, bring his people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the grieuous burden of tributes and taxes to a forreine Prince: Lea≈øt of all, make them tributary to a Prie≈øt; vnto whom it no way apperteineth to haue any hand in the ciuill affaires of Kings, or to di≈øtaine, and vnhallow their Crownes. And therefore when the Pope di≈øpatched his <hi>Nuntio</hi> to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus Augu≈øtus,</hi> reque≈øting the King to auert <hi>Lewis</hi> his ≈øonne from laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny claime to the Kingdome of <hi>England; Philip</hi> an≈øwered the Legat (as we haue it in <hi>Matth.

Therefore the Popes right pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

Or were the people of <hi>England</hi> per≈øwaded, that for all their ≈øub≈øtance, wealth, and life be≈øtowed on the Pope, his Holine≈ø≈øe by way of exchange returned them better weight and mea≈øure of ≈øpirituall graces?

<pb n="479" facs="tcp:23110:261"/>third E≈øtate, and with obedience due to the King: For they doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øe, that in ca≈øe the King ≈øhall commaund them to doe any act contrarie to their con≈øcience, they would flie at his throat, would make any attempt again≈øt his life, would refu≈øe to pay their taxations, or to defend him in the warres: They make no profe≈ø≈øion of depo≈øing the King, or di≈øcharging the people from the oath of allegiance tendred to the King: which is the very point or i≈ø≈øue of the matter in controuer≈øie, and the maine mi≈øcheife, again≈øt which the third E≈øtate hath bin mo≈øt worthily carefull to prouide a whole≈øome remedie by this Article. There is a world of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the termes of di≈øobedience, and of depo≈øition. It is one thing to di≈øobey the Kings commaund in matters prohibited by diuine lawes, and yet in all other matters to performe full ≈øubiection vnto the King. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing of a farre higher degree or ≈øtraine of di≈øloyaltie, to bare the King of his Royall robes, throne, and ≈øcepter, and when he is thus farre di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced, to degrade him and to put him from his degree and place of a King. If the holy Father ≈øhould charge the L. Cardinal to doe ≈øome act repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in his owne knowledge to the Law of God, I will religiou≈øly, and according to the rule of charitie pre≈øume, that his Lord≈øhip in this ca≈øe would ≈øtand out again≈øt his Holine≈ø≈øe, and notwith≈øtanding would ≈øtill acknowledge him to be Pope.</p>

                     <q>His Lord≈øhip yet pro≈øecutes and followes his former purpo≈øe: <hi>Hence are tho≈øe armes which they haue oftentimes borne again≈øt Kings, when Kings practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to take away the libertie of their con≈øcience and Religion. Hence are tho≈øe turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Commotions and ≈øeditions by them rai≈øed, as well in the Low-countryes against the King of Spaine, as in Swethland again≈øt the Catholike King of Polonia.</hi>
                     </q> Be≈øides, he ca≈øteth <hi>Iunius Brutus, Buchananus, Barclaius,</hi> and <hi>Ger≈øon</hi> in our teeth. To what end all this? I ≈øee not how it can bee auaileable to authorize the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing of Kings, e≈øpecially the Popes power to depo≈øe. And yet his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip here doth outface (by his leaue) and beare downe the trewth: For I could neuer yet learne by any good and trew intelligence, that in France tho≈øe of the Religion tooke armes at any time again≈øt their King: In the fir≈øt ciuill warres they ≈øtood onely vpon their guard: they ≈øtood onely to their lawfull wards and locks of defence: they armed not, nor tooke the field before they were pur≈øued with fire and ≈øword, burnt vp and ≈ølaughtred. Be≈øides, Religion was neither the root nor the rynde of tho≈øe inte≈øtine troubles. The trew ground of the quarrell was this: During the minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of King <hi>Francis</hi> II. the Prote≈øtants of France were a refuge and ≈øuccour to the Princes of the blood, when they were kept from the Kings pre≈øence, and by the ouer powring power of their enemies, were no better then plaine driuen and cha≈øed from the Court. I meane, the Grand-father of the King now raigning, and the Grand-father of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> when they had no place of ≈øafe retreate. In regard of which worthy and honourable ≈øeruice, it may ≈øeeme the French King hath rea≈øon to haue the Prote≈øtants in his gracious remembrance. With other commotion or in≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:23110:262"/>the Prote≈øtants are not iu≈øtly to be charged. But on the contrary, certaine it is that King <hi>Henry</hi> III. ray≈øed and ≈øent forth ≈øeuerall armies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Prote≈øtants, to ruine and roote them out of the Kingdome: howbeit, ≈øo ≈øoone as they perceiued the ≈øaid King was brought into dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tearms, they ranne with great ≈øpeed and ≈øpeciall fidelitie to the Kings re≈øcue and ≈øuccour, in the pre≈øent danger. Certaine it is, that by their good ≈øeruice the ≈øaid King was deliuered, from a mo≈øt extreame and imminent perill of his life in the city of Tours. Certaine it is, they neuer abandoned that <hi>Henry</hi> 3. nor his next ≈øucce≈ø≈øor <hi>Henry</hi> 4. in all the heat of reuolts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, rai≈øed in the greate≈øt part of the Kingdome by the Pope, and the more part of the Clergie but ≈øtood to the ≈øaid Kings in all their battels, to beare vp the Crowne then tottering and ready to fall. Certaine it is, that euen the heads and principalls of tho≈øe by whom the late King decea≈øed was pur≈øued with all extremities, at this day doe enioy the fruit of all the good ≈øeruices done to the King by the ≈øaid Prote≈øtants: And they are now di≈øgraced, kept vnder, expo≈øed to publike hatred. What, for kindling coales of que≈øtions and controuer≈øies about Religion? For≈øooth, not ≈øo: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe if they might haue equall and indifferent dealing, if credit might be giuen to their faithfull aduerti≈øements, the Crowne of their Kings ≈øhould bee no longer pinned to the Popes flie-flap; in France there ≈øhould bee no French exempted from ≈øubiection to the French King; cau≈øes of benefices or of matrimonie, ≈øhould bee no longer citable and ≈øummonable to the Romi≈øh Court; and the Kingdome ≈øhould bee no longer tributarie vnder the colour of annats, the fir≈øt fruits of Benefices after the remooue or death of the Incumbent, and other like impo≈øitions.</p>
                  <p>But why doe I ≈øpeake ≈øo much in the behalfe of the French Prote≈øtants? The Lord Cardinall him≈øelfe quittes them of this blame, when he telleth vs this doctrine for the depo≈øing of Kings by the Popes mace or verge, had credit and authoritie through all France, vntill <hi>Caluins</hi> time. Doth not his Lord≈øhip vnder-hand confe≈ø≈øe by the≈øe words, that Kings had beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies before <hi>Caluins</hi> time, the more di≈øhonoured, and the wor≈øe ≈øerued? Item, that Prote≈øtants, whom his Lord≈øhip calls heretikes, by the light of holy Scripture made the world then and euer ≈øince to ≈øee the right of Kings, oppre≈ø≈øed ≈øo long before? As for tho≈øe of the Low Countries, and the ≈øubiects of Swethland, I haue little to ≈øay of their ca≈øe, becau≈øe it is not within ordinary compa≈ø≈øe, and indeed ≈øerueth nothing to the purpo≈øe. The≈øe Nations, be≈øides the cau≈øe of Religion, doe ≈øtand vpon certaine rea≈øons of State, which I will not here take vpon me like a Iudge to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine or to ≈øift.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iunius Brutus,</hi> Whom the Lord Cardinall obiecteth, is an author vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne; and perhaps of purpo≈øe patcht vp by ≈øome Romani≈øt, with a wyly deceit to draw the reformed Religion into hatred with Chri≈øtian Princes.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Barclaius</hi> alledged by the Cardinall, meddles not with depo≈øing of Kings; but deals with di≈øavowing them for Kings, when they ≈øhal renounce the right of Royalty, and of their owne accord giue ouer the Kingdome. Now he that leaues it in the Kings choice, either to hold or to giue ouer his Crowne, leaues it not in the Popes power to take away the Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Ger≈øon</hi> obtruded by the Cardinal, we haue ≈øpoken ≈øufficiently before, Where it hath beene ≈øhewed how <hi>Ger≈øon</hi> is di≈øgui≈øed, masked, and peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Lord≈øhip. In briefe, I take not vpon me to iu≈øtifie and make good all the ≈øayings of particular authors: We glory (and well we may) that our religion affordeth no rules of rebellion; nor any di≈øpen≈øation to ≈øubiects for the oath of their allegiance; and that none of our Churches giue entertainement vnto ≈øuch mon≈øtrous and abhominable principles of di≈øloyaltie.</p>
                  <p>If any of the French, otherwi≈øe per≈øwaded in former times,
<note place="margin">Richcrius.</note> now hauing altered and changed his iudgement, doth contend for the Soueraignty of Kings again≈øt Papall v≈øurpation: He doubtles, for winding him≈øelfe out of the Laborinth of an error ≈øo intricate &amp; pernicious, de≈øerueth great honour and ≈øpeciall prai≈øe: He is worthy to hold a place of dignity aboue the L.

                  <p>At la≈øt his Lord≈øhip commeth to the clo≈øe of his Oration, and bindes vp <q>his whole harangue with a feate wreath of prai≈øes, proper to his King.

It ≈øauours not of good and faithfull ≈øeruice, to ≈ømooth and ≈øtroake the Kings head with a ≈øoft hand of oyled ≈øpeech, and in the meane time to take away the Crowne from his head, and to defile it with dirt. But let vs

<pb n="483" facs="tcp:23110:263"/>the Kingdome of all their trea≈øure? Were not the Kings of France, driuen to ≈øtoppe their violent cour≈øes by the pragmaticall ≈øanction? Did they not ≈øundry times interdict the Kingdome, degrade the Kings, ≈øolicite the neighbour-Princes to inuade and lay hold on the Kingdome, and ≈øtirre vp the people again≈øt the King, whereby a gate was opened to a world of troubles and parricides? Did not <hi>Rauaillac</hi> render this rea≈øon for his mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrous and horrible attempt, That King <hi>Henry</hi> had a de≈øigne to warre with God, becau≈øe he had a de≈øigne to take armes again≈øt his Holine≈ø≈øe, who is God? This makes me to wonder, what mooued the L. Cardinall to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhall the la≈øt ciuill warres and motions in <hi>France,</hi> in the ranke of examples of vnhappy ≈øeparation from the Pope, when the Pope him≈øelfe was the trumpetor of the ≈øame trouble≈øome motions. If the Pope had bene wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and offended by the French King, or his people, and the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> had been ≈øcourged with pe≈øtilence, or famine, or ≈øome other calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by forraine enemies; it might haue beene taken in probabilitie, as a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God for ≈øome iniurie done vnto his Vicar: But his Holine≈ø≈øe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the roote, the ground, the ma≈øter-workeman and artificer of all the≈øe mi≈øchiefes; how can it be ≈øaid, that God puni≈øheth any iniurie done to the Pope? but rather that his Holine≈ø≈øe doth reuenge his owne quarrell, and which is wor≈øt of all, when his Holine≈ø≈øe hath no iu≈øt cau≈øe of quarrell or offence. Now then; to exhort a Nation (as the L. Cardinall hath done) by the remembrance of former calamities, to curry fauour with the Pope, and to hold a ≈øtrict vnion with his Holine≈ø≈øe, is no exhortation to beare the Pope any re≈øpect of loue, or of reuerence, but rather a rubbing of memory, and a calling to minde of tho≈øe grieuous calamities, whereof the Pope hath been the only occa≈øion. It is al≈øo a threatning and obtruding of the Popes terrible thunder-bolts, which neuer ≈øcorched nor parched any skinne, (except crauens and meticulous bodies) and haue brought many great ≈øhowres of ble≈ø≈øings vpon my Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>France,</hi> if ≈øhe hath enioyed pro≈øperity in the times of her good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with Popes, it is becau≈øe the Pope ≈øeekes the amity of Princes that are in pro≈øperitie, haue the meanes to curbe his preten≈øions, and to put him to ≈øome plunge. Kings are not in pro≈øperity, becau≈øe the Pope holds amitie with Kings; but his Holine≈ø≈øe v≈øeth all deui≈øes, &amp; ≈øeeketh all meanes to haue amitie with Kings, becau≈øe he ≈øees them flouri≈øh &amp; ≈øayle with pro≈øperous winds. The ≈øwallow is no cau≈øe, but a companion of the ≈øpring: the Pope is no worker of a Kingdoms felicity, but a wooer of kings when they ≈øit in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities lap: he is no founder, but a follower of their good fortunes. On the other ≈øide: let a Kingdome fall into ≈øome grieuous di≈øa≈øter or calamitie, let ciuill warres boile in the bowels of the Kingdom; ciuil wars no le≈ø≈øe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the State, then fearefull and grieuous to the people; who ri≈øeth ≈øoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then the Pope, who ru≈øheth ≈øooner into the troubled ≈øtreames then the Pope, who thru≈øteth him≈øelfe ≈øooner into the heate of the quarrell then the Pope, who runneth ≈øooner to rai≈øe his gaine by the publike wrack then the
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:23110:264"/>Pope, and all vnder colour of a heart wounded and bleeding for the ≈øalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ≈øoules? If the lawfull King happen to be foyled, to be oppre≈ø≈øed, and thereupon the State by his fall to get a new ma≈øter by the Popes practi≈øe; then the ≈øaid new ma≈øter mu≈øt hold the Kingdome as of the Popes free gift, and rule or guide the ≈øterne of the State at his becke, and by his in≈øtruction. If the fir≈øt and right Lord, in de≈øpite of all the Popes fulminations and fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes, ≈øhall get the honourable day, and vpper hand of his enemies; then the holy Father with a cheerfull and plea≈øant grace, yea with fatherly gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, opens the rich cabinet of his iewells, I meane the trea≈øurie of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, and falls now to dandle and cocker the King in his fatherly lap, who≈øe throat if he could, he would haue cut not long before.</p>
                  <p>This pe≈øtilent mi≈øchiefe hath now a long time taken roote, and is growne to a great head in the Chri≈øtian world, through the ≈øecret, but iu≈øt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God; by whom Chri≈øtian Kings haue beene≈ømitten with a ≈øpirit of dizzine≈ø≈øe: Chri≈øtian Kings, who for many aages pa≈øt haue liued in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, without any ≈øound in≈øtruction, without any trew ≈øen≈øe and right feeling of their owne right and power, while≈øt vnder a ≈øhadow of Religion and fal≈øe cloake of pietie, their Kingdomes haue beene ouer-burdened, yea ouer-borne with tributes, and their Crownes made to ≈øtoope euen to mi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable bondage. That God in who≈øe hand the hearts of Kings are poi≈øed, and at his plea≈øure turned as the water-cour≈øes; that mighty God alone, in his good time, is able to rouze them out of ≈øo deepe a ≈ølumber, and to take order (their drowzy fits once ouer and ≈øhaken off with heroicall ≈øpirits) that Popes hereafter ≈øhall play no more vpon their patience, nor pre≈øume to put bits and ≈ønaffles in their noble mouthes, to the binding vp of their power with weake ≈øcruples, like mighty buls lead about by litle children with a ≈ømall twi≈øted thred. To that God, that King of Kings I deuote my ≈øcepter; at his feet in all humblenes I lay downe my Crowne; to his holy decrees and commaunds I will euer be a faithfull ≈øeruant, and in his battels a faithfull champion. To conclude; in this iu≈øt cau≈øe and quarrell, I dare ≈øend the challenge, and will require no ≈øecond, to maintaine as a defendant of honour, that my brother-Princes and my ≈øelfe, whom God hath aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vpon the Throne of Soueraigne Maie≈øtie and ≈øupreame dignity, doe hold the Royall dignitie of his Maie≈øtie alone; to who≈øe ≈øeruice, as a mo≈øt humble homager and va≈ø≈øall, I con≈øecrate all the glory, honour, ≈øplendor, and lu≈øtre of my earthly Kingdomes.</p>

And although this my profe≈ø≈øion be according to mine education, wherein (I thanke God) I ≈øucked the milke of Gods trewth, with the milke of my Nur≈øe: yet do I here prote≈øt vnto you, that I would neuer for ≈øuch a conceit of con≈øtancy or other preiudicate opinion, haue ≈øo firmly kept my fir≈øt profe≈ø≈øion, if I had not found it agreeable to all rea≈øon, and to the rule of my Con≈øcience.

And euen now at this time haue I bene carefull to reui≈øe and con≈øider deepely vpon the Lawes made again≈øt them, that ≈øome ouerture may be proponed to the pre≈øent Parliament for clearing the≈øe Lawes by rea≈øon (which is the ≈øoule of the Law) in ca≈øe they haue bene in times pa≈øt further, or more rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou≈øly extended by Iudges, then the meaning of the Law was, or might tend to the hurt a≈øwell of the innocent as of guiltie per≈øons. And as to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons of my Subiects which are of that profe≈ø≈øion, I mu≈øt diuide them into two rankes, Clerickes and Layickes; for the part of the Layicks, certainely I euer thought them farre more excu≈øable then the other ≈øort, becau≈øe that ≈øort of Religion containeth ≈øuch an ignorant, doubtfull, and implicit kinde of faith in the Layickes grounded vpon their Church, as except they doe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally beleeue what≈øoeuer their Teachers plea≈øe to affirme, they cannot be thought guilty of the≈øe particular points of here≈øies and corruptions, which their Teachers doe ≈øo wilfully profe≈ø≈øe. And againe I mu≈øt ≈øubdiuide the ≈øame Layickes into two rankes, that is, either quiet and well minded men, peaceable Subiects, who either being old, haue retayned their fir≈øt drunken in liquor vpon a certaine ≈øhamefa≈øtne≈ø≈øe to be thought curious or changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Or being young men, through euill education haue neuer bene nur≈øed or brought vp, but vpon ≈øuch venim in place of whole≈øome nutriment. And that ≈øort of people I would be ≈øorry to puni≈øh their bodies for the errour of their minds, the reformation whereof mu≈øt onely come of God and the trew Spirit. But the other ranke of Layicks, who either through Curio≈øitie,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:23110:268"/>affectation of Noueltie, or di≈øcontentment in their priuat humours, haue changed their coates, onely to be factious ≈øtirrers of Sedition, and Pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the common wealth, their backwardne≈ø≈øe in their Religion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a ground to me the Magi≈øtrate, to take the better heed to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and to correct their ob≈øtinacie. But for the part of the Clerickes, I mu≈øt directly ≈øay and affirme, that as long as they maintaine one ≈øpeciall point of their doctrine, and another point of their practi≈øe, they are no way ≈øufferable to remaine in this Kingdome. Their point of doctrine is that arrogant and ambitious Supremacie of their Head the Pope, whereby he not onely claimes to bee Spirituall head of all Chri≈øtians, but al≈øo to haue an Imperiall ciuill power ouer all Kings and Emperors, dethroning and decrowning Princes with his foot as plea≈øeth him, and di≈øpen≈øing and di≈øpo≈øing of all Kingdomes and Empires at his appetite. The other point which they ob≈øerue in continuall practi≈øe, is the a≈ø≈øa≈ø≈øinates and murthers of Kings, thinking it no ≈øinne, but rather a matter of ≈øaluation, to doe all actions of rebellion and ho≈øtilitie again≈øt their naturall Soueraigne Lord, if he be once cur≈øed, his ≈øubiects di≈øcharged of their fidelitie, and his Kingdome giuen a prey by that three crowned Monarch, or rather Mon≈øter their Head. And in this point, I haue no occa≈øion to ≈øpeake fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here, ≈øauing that I could wi≈øh from my heart, that it would plea≈øe God to make me one of the members of ≈øuch a generall Chri≈øtian vnion in Religion, as laying wilfulne≈ø≈øe a≈øide on both hands, wee might meete in the midde≈øt, which is the Center and perfection of all things. For if they would leaue, and be a≈øhamed of ≈øuch new and gro≈ø≈øe Corruptions of theirs, as them≈øelues cannot maintaine, nor denie to bee worthy of reformation, I would for mine owne part be content to meete them in the mid-way, ≈øo that all nouelties might be renounced on either ≈øide. For as my faith is the Trew, Ancient, Catholike and Apo≈øtolike faith, grounded vpon the Scriptures and expre≈ø≈øe word of God: ≈øo will I euer yeeld all reuerence to antiquitie in the points of Eccle≈øia≈øticall pollicy; and by that meanes ≈øhall I euer with Gods grace keepe my ≈øelfe from either being an hereticke in Faith, or ≈øchi≈ømatick in matters of Pollicie. But of one thing would I haue the Papi≈øts of this Land to bee admoni≈øhed, That they pre≈øume not ≈øo much vpon my Lenitie (becau≈øe I would be loath to be thought a Per≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) as thereupon to thinke it lawfull for them dayly to encrea≈øe their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and ≈øtrength in this Kingdome, whereby if not in my time, at lea≈øt in the time of my po≈øteritie, they might be in hope to erect their Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

For I could not permit the encrea≈øe and growing of their Religion, without fir≈øt betraying of my ≈øelfe, and mine owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience:
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:23110:268"/>Secondly, this whole I≈øle, a≈øwell the part I am come from, as the part I remaine in, in betraying their Liberties, and reducing them to the former ≈ølaui≈øh yoke, which both had ca≈øten off, before I came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt them: And thirdly, the libertie of the Crowne in my po≈øteritie, which I ≈øhould leaue againe vnder a new ≈ølauery, hauing found i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore would I wi≈øh all good Subiects that are deceiued with that corruption, fir≈øt if they find any beginning of in≈øtinction in them≈øelues of knowledge and loue to the Trewth, to fo≈øter the ≈øame by all lawfull meanes, and to beware of quenching the ≈øpirit that worketh within them; And if they can find as yet no motion tending that way, to be ≈øtudious to reade and conferre with learned men, and to v≈øe all ≈øuch meanes as may further their Re≈øolution, a≈ø≈øuring them≈øelues, that as long as they are di≈øconformable in Religion from vs, they cannot bee but halfe my Subiects, bee able to doe but halfe ≈øeruice, and I to want the be≈øt halfe of them, which is their ≈øoules. And here haue I occa≈øion to ≈øpeake to you my Lords the Bi≈øhops: For as you, my Lord of Durham, ≈øaid very learnedly to day in your Sermon, Correction without in≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is but a Tyrannie: So ought you, and all the Clergie vnder you, to be more carefull, vigilant, and diligent then you haue bene, to winne Soules to God, a≈øwell by your exemplary life, as doctrine. And ≈øince you ≈øee how carefull they are, ≈øparing neither labour, paines, nor extreme perill of their per≈øons to diuert, (the Deuill is ≈øo bu≈øie a Bi≈øhop) yee ≈øhould bee the more carefull and wakefull in your charges. Follow the rule pre≈øcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed you by S. <hi>Paul, Bee carefull to exhort and to instruct in ≈øea≈øon, and out of ≈øea≈øon:</hi> and where you haue beene any way ≈øluggi≈øh before, now waken your ≈øelues vp againe with a new diligence in this point, remitting the ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øe to God, who calling them either at the ≈øecond, third, tenth or twelfth houre, as they are alike welcome to him, ≈øo ≈øhall they bee to mee his Lieutenant here.</p>
            <p>The third rea≈øon of my conuening of you at this time,
<note place="margin">The third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of a≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Parliament.</note> which contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ≈øuch actions of my thankefulne≈ø≈øe toward you, as I may either doe, or leaue vndone, yet ≈øhall with Gods grace euer pre≈ø≈øe to performe all the dayes of my life: It con≈øi≈øts in the≈øe two points; In making of Lawes at certaine times, which is onely at ≈øuch times as this in Parliament; or in the carefull execution thereof at all other times. As for the making of them, I will thus farre faithfully promi≈øe vnto you, That I will euer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the weale of the body, and of the whole Common-wealth, in making of good Lawes and con≈øtitutions, to any particular or priuate ends of mine, thinking euer the wealth and weale of the Common-wealth to bee my greate≈øt weale and worldly felicitie: A point wherein a lawfull King doeth directly differ from a Tyrant. But at this time I am onely thus farre to forewarne you in that point, That you beware to ≈øeeke the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of too many Lawes, for two e≈øpeciall rea≈øons: Fir≈øt, becau≈øe <hi>In corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øsima
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:23110:269"/>Republica plurimae leges;</hi> and the execution of good Lawes is farre more profitable in a Common-wealth, then to burden mens memories with the making of too many of them. And next, becau≈øe the making of too many Lawes in one Parliament, will bring in confu≈øion, for lacke of lei≈øure wi≈øely to deliberate before you conclude: For the Bi≈øhop ≈øaid well to day, That to Deliberation would a large time be giuen, but to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a greater promptne≈ø≈øe was required. As for the execution of good Lawes, it hath bene very wi≈øely and honourably fore≈øeene and ordered by my predece≈ø≈øours in this Kingdome, in planting ≈øuch a number of Iudges, and all ≈øorts of Magi≈øtrates in conuenient places for the execution of the ≈øame: And therefore mu≈øt I now turne mee to you that are Iudges and Magi≈øtrates vnder mee, as mine Eyes and Eares in this ca≈øe. I can ≈øay none otherwi≈øe to you, then as <hi>Ezekias</hi> the good King of <hi>Iuda</hi> ≈øaid to their Iudges, <hi>Remember that the Thrones that you fit on are Gods, and neither yours nor mine:</hi> And that as you mu≈øt be an≈øwerable to mee, ≈øo mu≈øt both you and I be an≈øwerable to GOD, for the due execution of our Offices. That place is no place for you to vtter your affections in, you mu≈øt not there hate your foe nor loue your friend, feare the offence of the greater partie or pity the mi≈øerie of the meaner; yee mu≈øt be blinde and not ≈øee di≈øtinctions of per≈øons, handle≈ø≈øe, not to receiue bribes; but keepe that iu≈øt temper and mid-cour≈øe in all your proceedings, that like a iu≈øt ballance ye may neither ≈øway to the right nor left hand. Three principall qualities are required in you; Knowledge, Courage, and Sinceritie: that you may di≈øcerne with knowledge, execute with courage, and doe both in vpright ≈øinceritie. And as for my part, I doe vow and prote≈øt here in the pre≈øence of God, and of this honourable Audience, I neuer ≈øhall be wearie, nor omit no occa≈øion, wherein I may ≈øhew my carefulne≈ø≈øe of the execution of good Lawes. And as I wi≈øh you that are Iudges not to be weary in your Office in doing of it; ≈øo ≈øhall I neuer be wearie, with Gods grace, to take account of you, which is properly my calling.</p>
            <p>And thus hauing tolde you the three cau≈øes of my conuening of this Parliament, all three tending onely to vtter my thankefulne≈ø≈øe, but in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers formes, the fir≈øt by word, the other two by action; I doe confe≈ø≈øe that when I haue done and performed all that in this Speech I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed, <hi>Inutilis ≈øeruus ≈øum:</hi> Inutile, becau≈øe the meaning of the word <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utilis</hi> in that place of Scripture is vnder≈øtood, that in doing all that ≈øeruice which wee can to God, it is but our due, and wee doe nothing to God but that which wee are bound to doe. And in like maner, when I haue done all that I can for you, I doe nothing but that which I am bound to doe, and am accomptable to God vpon the contrary: For I doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the ≈øpeciall and greate≈øt point of difference that is betwixt a rightfull King and an v≈øurping Tyrant is in this; That whereas the proude and ambitious Tyrant doeth thinke his Kingdome and people
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:23110:269"/>are onely ordeined for ≈øatisfaction of his de≈øires and vnrea≈øonable appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites; The righteous and iu≈øt King doeth by the contrary acknowledge him≈øelfe to bee ordeined for the procuring of the wealth and pro≈øperitie of his people, and that his greate≈øt and principall worldly felicitie mu≈øt con≈øift in their pro≈øperitie. If you bee rich I cannot bee poore, if you bee happy I cannot but bee fortunate, and I prote≈øt that your welfare ≈øhall euer be my greate≈øt care and contentment: And that I am a Seruant it is mo≈øt trew, that as I am Head and Gouernour of all the people in my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion who are my naturall va≈ø≈øals and Subiects, con≈øidering them in numbers and di≈øtinct Rankes; So if wee will take the whole People as one body and Ma≈ø≈øe, then as the Head is ordeined for the body and not the Body for the Head; ≈øo mu≈øt a righteous King know him≈øelfe to bee ordeined for his people, and not his people for him: For although a King and people be <hi>Relata;</hi> yet can hee be no King if he want people and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. But there be many people in the world that lacke a Head, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will neuer bee a≈øhamed to confe≈ø≈øe it my principall Honour to bee the great Seruant of the Common-wealth, and euer thinke the pro≈øperitie thereof to be my greate≈øt felicitie, as I haue already ≈øaid.</p>
            <p>But as it was the whole Body of this Kingdome, with an vniforme a≈ø≈øent and harmonie, as I tolde you in the beginning of my Speech, which did ≈øo farre oblige mee in good will and thankefulne≈ø≈øe of requitall by their alacritie and readine≈ø≈øe in declaring and receiuing mee to that place which God had prouided for mee, and not any particular per≈øons: (for then it had not bene the body) So is my thankefulne≈ø≈øe due to the whole State. For euen as in matter of faults, <hi>Quod √† multis peccatur, impun√® peccatur:</hi> Euen ≈øo in the matter of vertuous and good deedes, what is done by the willing con≈øent and harmonie of the whole body, no particular per≈øon can iu≈øtly claime thankes as proper to him for the ≈øame. And therefore I mu≈øt heere make a little Apologie for my ≈øelfe, in that I could not ≈øati≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the particular humours of euery per≈øon, that looked for ≈øome aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or reward at my hand ≈øince my entrie into this Kingdome. Three kinde of things were craued of mee: Aduancement to honour, Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to place of Credit about my Per≈øon, and Reward in matters of land or profit. If I had be≈øtowed Honour vpon all, no man could haue beene aduanced to Honour: for the degrees of Honour doe con≈øi≈øt in perfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ≈øome aboue their fellowes. If euery man had the like acce≈ø≈øe to my Priuy or Bed-chamber, then no man could haue it, becau≈øe it cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all. And if I had be≈øtowed Lands and Rewards vpon euery man, the fountaine of my liberalitie would be ≈øo exhau≈øted and dried, as I would lacke meanes to bee liberall to any man. And yet was I not ≈øo ≈øparing, but I may without vaunting affirme that I haue enlarged my fauour in all the three degrees, towards as many and more then euer King of <hi>England</hi> did in ≈øo ≈øhort a ≈øpace: No, I rather craue your pardon that I haue beene
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:23110:270"/>≈øo bountifull: for if the meanes of the Crowne bee wa≈øted, I behoued then to haue recour≈øe to you my Subiects, and bee burden≈øome to you, which I would bee lothe≈øt to bee of any King aliue. For as it is trew, that as I haue already ≈øaid, it was a whole Body which did de≈øerue ≈øo well at my hand, and not euery particular per≈øon of the people: yet were there ≈øome who by rea≈øon of their Office, credit with the people or otherwi≈øe, tooke occa≈øion both before, and at the time of my comming among≈øt you, to giue proofe of their loue and affection towards me. Not that I am any way in doubt, that if other of my Subiects had beene in their places, and had had the like occa≈øion, but they would haue vttered the like good effects, (≈øo generall and ≈øo great were the loue and affection of you all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mee:) But yet this hauing beene performed by ≈øome ≈øpeciall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, I could not without vnthankfulne≈ø≈øe but requite them accordingly. And therefore had I iu≈øt occa≈øion to aduance ≈øome in Honour, ≈øome to places of ≈øeruice about mee, and by rewarding to enable ≈øome who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerued well of mee, and were not otherwi≈øe able to maintaine the rankes I thought them capable of, and others who although they had not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly de≈øerued before, yet I found them capable and worthy of place of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment and credit, and not able to ≈øu≈øtaine tho≈øe places for which I thought them fit, without my helpe. Two e≈øpeciall cau≈øes moued mee to be ≈øo open handed: whereof the one was rea≈øonable and honourable; but the other I will not bee a≈øhamed to confe≈ø≈øe vnto you, proceeded of mine owne infirmitie. That which was iu≈øt and honourable, was: That being ≈øo farre beholding to the body of the whole State, I thought I could not refu≈øe to let runne ≈øome ≈ømall brookes out of the fountaine of my thankefulne≈ø≈øe to the whole, for refre≈øhing of particular per≈øons that were members of that multitude. The other which proceeded out of mine owne infirmitie, was the multitude and importunitie of Sutors. But although rea≈øon come by infu≈øion in a maner, yet experience groweth with time and labour: And therefore doe I not doubt, but experience in time comming will both teach the particular Subiects of this Kingdome, not to be ≈øo importune and vndi≈øcreete in crauing: And mee not to be ≈øo ea≈øily and lightly mooued, in granting that which may be harmefull to my E≈øtate, and con≈øequently to the whole Kingdome.</p>
            <p>And thus hauing at length declared vnto you my minde in all the points, for the which I called this Parliament: My conclu≈øion ≈øhall onely now be to excu≈øe my ≈øelfe, in ca≈øe you haue not found ≈øuch Eloquence in my Speech, as peraduenture you might haue looked for at my hands. I might, if I li≈øt, alledge the great weight of my Affaires and my continuall bu≈øine≈ø≈øe and di≈øtraction, that I could neuer haue lea≈øure to thinke vpon what I was to ≈øpeake, before I came to the place where I was to ≈øpeake: And I might al≈øo alledge that my fir≈øt ≈øight of this ≈øo famous and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable an A≈ø≈øembly, might likewi≈øe breede ≈øome impediment. But
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:23110:270"/>leauing the≈øe excu≈øes, I will plainely and freely in my maner tell you the trew cau≈øe of it, which is; That it becommeth a King, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to v≈øe no other Eloquence then plainne≈ø≈øe and ≈øinceritie. By plainene≈ø≈øe I meane, that his Speeches ≈øhould be ≈øo cleare and voyd of all ambiguitie, that they may not be throwne, nor rent a≈øunder in contrary ≈øences like the old Oracles of the Pagan gods. And by ≈øinceritie, I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand that vprightne≈ø≈øe and hone≈øtie which ought to be in a Kings whole Speeches and actions: That as farre as a King is in Honour erected aboue any of his Subiects, ≈øo farre ≈øhould he ≈øtriue in ≈øinceritie to be aboue them all, and that his tongue ≈øhould be euer the trew Me≈ø≈øenger of his heart: and this ≈øort of Eloquence may you euer a≈ø≈øuredly looke for at my hands.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and you the Knights and Burge≈ø≈øes of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, It was farre from my thoughts till ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lately before my comming to this place, that this Subiect ≈øhould haue bene mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtred vnto mee, whereupon I am now to ≈øpeake. But now it ≈øo falleth out, That whereas in the preceding Se≈ø≈øion of this Parliament, the principall occa≈øion of my Speach was, to thanke and congratulate all you of this Hou≈øe, and in you, all the whole Common-wealth (as being the repre≈øentatiue body of the State) for your ≈øo willing, and louing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and embracing of mee in that place, which GOD and Nature by de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of blood, had in his owne time prouided for me: So now my Subiect is, to ≈øpeake of a farre greater Thanke≈øgiuing then before I gaue to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a farre greater per≈øon, which is to GOD, for the great and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Deliuery he hath at this time granted to me, and to you all, and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the whole body of this E≈øtate.</p>
            <p>I mu≈øt therefore begin with this old and mo≈øt approued Sentence of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, <hi>Mi≈øericordia Dei ≈øupra omnia opera eius.</hi> For Almightie God did not furni≈øh ≈øo great matter to his glory by the Creation of this great World, as he did by the Redemption of the ≈øame. Neither did his generation of the little world in our old &amp; fir≈øt Adam, ≈øo much ≈øet forth the prai≈øes of God in his Iu≈øtice and Mercy, as did our Regeneration in the la≈øt &amp; ≈øecond Adam.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="500" facs="tcp:23110:272"/>And now I mu≈øt craue a little pardon of you. That ≈øince Kings are in the word of GOD it ≈øelfe called Gods, as being his Lieutenants and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents on earth, and ≈øo adorned and furni≈øhed with ≈øome ≈øparkles of the Diuinitie; to compare ≈øome of the workes of GOD the great KING, towards the whole and generall world, to ≈øome of his workes towards mee, and this little world of my Dominions, compa≈ø≈øed and ≈øeuered by the Sea from the re≈øt of the earth. Foras GOD for the iu≈øt puni≈øhment of the fir≈øt great ≈øinnes in the originall world, when the ≈øonnes of GOD went in to the daughters of men, and the cup of their iniquities of all ≈øorts was filled, and heaped vp to the full, did by a generall deluge and ouerflowing of waters, baptize the world to a generall de≈øtruction, and not to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall purgation (onely excepted NOAH and his family, who did repent and beleeue the threatnings of GODS iudgement:) So now when the world ≈øhall waxe old as a garment, and that all the impieties and ≈øinnes that can be deui≈øed again≈øt both the fir≈øt and ≈øecond Table, haue and ≈øhall bee committed to the full mea≈øure; GOD is to puni≈øh the world the ≈øecond time by fire, to the generall de≈øtruction and not purgation thereof: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though as was done in the former to NOAH and his family by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; So ≈øhall all we that beleeue be likewi≈øe purged, and not de≈øtroyed by the fire. In the like ≈øort, I ≈øay, I may iu≈øtly compare the≈øe two great and fearefull <hi>Dome≈ø-dayes,</hi> wherewith GOD threatned to de≈øtroy mee and all you of this little world that haue intere≈øt in me. For although I confe≈ø≈øe, as all mankinde, ≈øo chiefly Kings, as being in the higher places like the high Trees, or ≈øtaye≈øt Mountaines, and ≈øteepe≈øt Rockes, are mo≈øt ≈øubiect to the dayly tempe≈øts of innumerable dangers; and I among≈øt all other Kings haue euer bene ≈øubiect vnto them, not onely euer ≈øince my birth, but euen as I may iu≈øtly ≈øay, before my birth: and while I was yet in my mothers belly: yet haue I bene expo≈øed to two more ≈øpeciall and greater dangers then all the re≈øt.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt of them, in the Kingdome where I was borne, and pa≈ø≈øed the fir≈øt part of my life: And the la≈øt of them here, which is the greate≈øt. In the former I ≈øhould haue bene baptized in blood, and in my de≈øtruction not onely the Kingdom wherein I then was, but ye al≈øo by your future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt, ≈øhould haue ta≈øted of my ruine: Yet it plea≈øed GOD to deliuer mee, as it were from the very brinke of death, from the point of the dagger, and ≈øo to purge me by my thankefull acknowledgement of ≈øo great a benefite. But in this, which did ≈øo lately fall out, and which was a de≈øtruction pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared not for me alone, but for you all that are here pre≈øent, and wherein no ranke, aage, nor ≈øexe ≈øhould haue bene ≈øpared; This was not a crying ≈øinne of blood, as the former, but it may well bee called a roaring, nay a thundring ≈øinne of fire and brim≈øtone, from the which GOD hath ≈øo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculou≈øly deliuered vs all. What I can ≈øpeake of this, I know not: Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what can I not ≈øpeake of it? And therefore I mu≈øt for horror ≈øay with the Poet, <hi>Vox faucibus haeret.</hi>

<note n="3" place="margin">Miraculous euent, the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie.</note> the di≈øcouery hereof is not a little wonderfull, which would bee thought the more miraculous by you all, if you were a≈øwell acquainted with my naturall di≈øpo≈øition, as tho≈øe are who be neere about me: For as I euer did hold Su≈øpition to be the ≈øicknes of a Tyrant, ≈øo was I ≈øo farre vpon the other extremity, as I rather contemned all aduerti≈øements, or apprehen≈øions of practi≈øes. And yet now at this time was I ≈øo farre contrary to my ≈øelfe, as when the Letter was ≈øhewed to me by my Secretary, wherein a generall ob≈øcure aduerti≈øement was giuen of ≈øome dangerous blow at this time, I did vpon the in≈øtant interpret and apprehend ≈øome darke phra≈øes therein, contrary to the ordinary Grammer con≈øtruction of them, (and in an other ≈øort then I am ≈øure any Diuine, or Lawyer in any Vniuer≈øitie would haue taken them) to be meant by this horrible forme of blowing vs vp all by Powder; And thereupon ordered that ≈øearch to be made, whereby the matter was di≈øcouered, and the man apprehended: whereas if I had apprehended or interpreted it to any other ≈øort of danger, no worldly proui≈øion or preuention could haue made vs e≈øcape our vtter de≈øtruction.</p>
            <p>And in that al≈øo was there a wonderfull prouidence of God, that when the party him≈øelfe was taken, he was but new come out of his hou≈øe from working, hauing his Fireworke for kindling ready in his pocket, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with as he confe≈ø≈øeth, if he had bene taken but immediatly before when he was in the Hou≈øe, he was re≈øolued to haue blowen vp him≈øelfe with his Takers.</p>
            <p>One thing for mine owne part haue I cau≈øe to thanke GOD in, That if GOD for our ≈øinnes had ≈øuffered their wicked intents to haue preuailed, it ≈øhould neuer haue bene ≈øpoken nor written in aages ≈øucceeding, that I had died ingloriou≈øly in an Ale-hou≈øe, a Stews, or ≈øuch vile place, but mine end ≈øhould haue bene with the mo≈øt Honourable and be≈øt company, and in that mo≈øt Honourable and fitte≈øt place for a King to be in, for doing the turnes mo≈øt proper to his Office.

            <p>It re≈øteth now that I ≈øhould ≈øhortly informe you what is to bee done hereafter vpon the occa≈øion of this horrible and ≈øtrange accident. As for your part that are my faithfull and louing Subiects of all degrees, I know that your hearts are ≈øo burnt vp with zeale in this errant, and your tongues ≈øo ready to vtter your duetifull affections, and your hands and feete ≈øo bent to concurre in the execution thereof, (for which as I neede not to ≈øpurre you, ≈øo can I not but prai≈øe you for the ≈øame:) As it may very well be po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible that the zeale of your hearts ≈øhall make ≈øome of you in your ≈øpeaches ra≈øhly to blame ≈øuch as may bee innocent of this attempt; But vpon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part I wi≈øh you to con≈øider, That I would be ≈øorie that any being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of this practi≈øe, either dome≈øticall or forraine, ≈øhould receiue blame or harme for the ≈øame. For although it cannot be denied, That it was the onely blinde ≈øuper≈øtition of their errors in Religion, that led them to this de≈øperate deuice; yet doth it not follow, That all profe≈ø≈øing that <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> religion were guiltie of the ≈øame. For as it is trew, That no other ≈øect of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, not excepting <hi>Turke, Iew,</hi> nor <hi>Pagan,</hi> no not euen tho≈øe of <hi>Calicute,</hi> who adore the deuill, did euer maintaine by the grounds of their religion, That it was lawfull, or rather meritorious (as the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Catholickes call it) to murther Princes or people for quarrell of Religion. And although particular men of all profe≈ø≈øions of Religion haue beene ≈øome Theeues, ≈øome Murtherers, ≈øome Traitors, yet euer when they came to their end and iu≈øt puni≈øhment, they confe≈ø≈øed their fault to bee in their nature, and not in their profe≈ø≈øion, (The≈øe <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Catholicks onely excepted:) Yet it is trew on the other ≈øide, that many hone≈øt men blinded peraduenture with ≈øome opinions of Popery, as if they be not ≈øound in the que≈øtions of the
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:23110:274"/>
               <hi>Reall pre≈øence,</hi> or in the number of the Sacraments, or ≈øome ≈øuch Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øtion: yet doe they either not know, or at lea≈øt not beleeue all the trew grounds of Popery, which is in deed <hi>The my≈øterie of iniquitie.</hi> And therefore doe we iu≈øtly confe≈ø≈øe, that many Papi≈øts, e≈øpecially our forefathers, laying their onely tru≈øt vpon CHRIST and his Merits at their la≈øt breath, may be, and often times are ≈øaued; dete≈øting in that point, and thinking the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cltie of Puritanes worthy of fire, that will admit no ≈øaluation to any Papi≈øt. I therefore thus doe conclude this point, That as vpon the one part ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hone≈øt men, ≈øeduced with ≈øome errors of Popery, may yet remaine good and faithfull Subiects: So vpon the other part, none of tho≈øe that trewly know and beleeue the whole grounds, and Schoole conclu≈øions of their doctrine, can euer proue either good Chri≈øtians, or faithfull Subiects. And for the part of forraine Princes and States, I may ≈øo much the more acquite them, and their Mini≈øters of their knowledge and con≈øent to any ≈øuch villanie, as I may iu≈øtly ≈øay, that in that point I better know all Chri≈øtian Kings by my ≈øelfe, That no King nor Prince of Honour will euer aba≈øe him≈øelfe ≈øo much, as to thinke a good thought of ≈øo ba≈øe and di≈øhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Treachery, wi≈øhing you therefore, that as God hath giuen me an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie Peace and Amitie, with all other Chri≈øtian Princes my neighbours (as was euen now very grauely told you by my L. Chancellor) that ≈øo you will reuerently iudge and ≈øpeake of them in this ca≈øe. And for my part I would wi≈øh with tho≈øe ancient Philo≈øophers, that there were a Chri≈øtall window in my bre≈øt, wherein all my people might ≈øee the ≈øecrete≈øt thoughts of my heart, for then might you all ≈øee no alteration in my minde for this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, further then in the≈øe two points.

And now in this matter if I haue troubled your eares with an abrupt ≈øpeach, vndige≈øted in any good methode or order; you haue to con≈øider that an abrupt, and vnadui≈øed ≈øpeach doeth be≈øt become in the relation of ≈øo abrupt and vnorderly an accident.</p>
            <p>And although I haue ordained the proroguing of this Parliament vntil after Chri≈øtmas vpon two nece≈ø≈øary re≈øpects: whereof the fir≈øt is, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I nor my Councell can haue lei≈øure at this time both to take order for the Apprehen≈øion and triall of the≈øe Con≈øpiratours, and al≈øo to wait vpon the dayly affaires of the Parliament, as the Councell mu≈øt doe: And the other rea≈øon is, the nece≈ø≈øitie at this time of diuers of your pre≈øences in your Shires that haue Charges and Commandements there. For as the≈øe wretches thought to haue blowen vp in a maner the whole world of this I≈øland, euery man being now commen vp here, either for publike cau≈øes of Parliament, or el≈øe for their owne priuate cau≈øes in Law, or otherwi≈øe: So the≈øe Rebels that now wander through the Countrey, could neuer haue gotten ≈øo fit a time of ≈øafetie in their pa≈ø≈øage, or what≈øoeuer vnlawfull Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:23110:274"/>as now when the Countrey by the fore≈øaid occa≈øions is in a maner left de≈øolate, and wa≈øte vnto them. Be≈øides that, it may be that I ≈øhall de≈øire you at your next Se≈ø≈øion, to take vpon you the Iudgement of this Crime: For as ≈øo extraordinary a Fact de≈øerues extraordinary Iudgement, So can there not I thinke (following euen their owne Rule) be a fitter Iudgement for them, then that they ≈øhould be mea≈øured with the ≈øame mea≈øure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they thought to mea≈øure vs: And that the ≈øame place and per≈øons, whom they thought to de≈øtroy, ≈øhould be the iu≈øt auengers of their ≈øo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall a Parricide: Yet not knowing that I will haue occa≈øion to meete with you my ≈øelfe in this place at the beginning of the next Se≈ø≈øion of this Paliament, (becau≈øe if it had not been for deliuering of the Articles agreed vpon by the Commi≈ø≈øioners of the Vnion, which was thought mo≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to be done in my pre≈øence, where both Head and Members of the Parliament were met together, my pre≈øence had not otherwi≈øe been requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite here at this time.) I haue therefore thought good for conclu≈øion of this Meeting, to di≈øcour≈øe to you ≈øomewhat anent the trew nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a Parliament, which I will remit to your memories till your next ≈øitting downe, that you may then make v≈øe of it as occa≈øion ≈øhall bee mini≈øtred.</p>
            <p>For albeit it be trew, that at the fir≈øt Se≈ø≈øion of my fir≈øt Parliament, which was not long after mine Entrie into this Kingdome, It could not become me to in orme you of any thing belonging to Law or State heere: (for all knowledge mu≈øt either bee infu≈øed or acquired, and ≈øeeing the former ≈øort thereof is now with Prophecie cea≈øed in the world, it could not be po≈ø≈øible for me at my fir≈øt Entry here, before Experience had taught it me, to be able to vnder≈øtand the particular my≈øteries of this State:) yet now that I haue reigned almo≈øt three yeeres among≈øt you, and haue beene carefull to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerue tho≈øe things that belong to the office of a King, albeit that Time be but a ≈øhort time for experience in others, yet in a King may it be thought a rea≈øonable long time, e≈øpecially in me, who, although I be but in a maner a new King heere, yet haue bene long acquainted with the office of a King in ≈øuch another Kingdome, as doeth neere≈øt of all others agree with the Lawes and cu≈øtomes of this State. Remitting to your con≈øideration to iudge of that which hath beene concluded by the Commi≈ø≈øioners of the Vnion, wherein I am at this time to ≈øignifie vnto you, That as I can beare witne≈ø≈øe to the fore≈øaid Commi≈ø≈øioners, that they haue not agreed nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded therein any thing, wherein they haue not fore≈øeen as well the weale and commodity of the one Countrey, as of the other; So can they all beare mee record, that I was ≈øo farre from pre≈ø≈øing them to agree to any thing, which might bring with it any preiudice to this people; as by the contrary I did euer admoni≈øh them, neuer to conclude vpon any ≈øuch Vnion, as might cary hurt or grudge with it to either of the ≈øaid Nations: for the leauing of any ≈øuch thing, could not but be the greate≈øt hinderance that might be to ≈øuch an Action, which God by the lawes of Nature had proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:23110:275"/>to be in his owne time, and hath now in effect perfected in my Per≈øon, to which purpo≈øe my Lord Chancellour hath better ≈øpoken, then I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to relate.</p>
            <p>And as to the nature of this high Court of Parliament, It is nothing el≈øe but the Kings great Councell, which the King doeth a≈ø≈øemble either vpon occa≈øion of interpreting, or abrogating old Lawes, or making of new, according as ill maners ≈øhall de≈øerue, or for the publike puni≈øhment of notorious euill doers, or the prai≈øe and reward of the vertuous and well de≈øeruers; wherein the≈øe foure things are to be con≈øidered.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> whereof this Court is compo≈øed.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> what matters are proper for it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to what end it is ordeined.</p>
            <p>And fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> what are the meanes and wayes whereby this end ≈øhould bee brought to pa≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>As for the thing it ≈øelfe, It is compo≈øed of a Head and a Body: The Head is the King, the Body are the members of the Parliament. This Body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine is ≈øubdiuided into two parts; The Vpper and Lower Hou≈øe: The Vpper compounded partly of Nobility, Temporall men, who are herita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Councellors to the high Court of Parliament by the honour of their Creation and Lands: And partly of Bi≈øhops, Spirituall men, who are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe by the vertue of their place and dignitie Councellours, Life Renters, or <hi>Ad vitam</hi> of this Court. The other Hou≈øe is compo≈øed of Knights for the Shire; and Gentry, and Burge≈ø≈øes for the Townes. But becau≈øe the number would be infinite for all the Gentlemen and Burge≈ø≈øes to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent at euery Parliament, Therefore a certaine number is ≈øelected and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen out of that great Body, ≈øeruing onely for that Parliament, where their per≈øons are the repre≈øentation of that Body.</p>
            <p>Now the matters whereof they are to treate ought therefore to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and rather of ≈øuch matters as cannot well bee performed without the a≈ø≈øembling of that generall Body, and no more of the≈øe generals nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then nece≈ø≈øity ≈øhall require: for as <hi>in Corrupti≈øsima Republica ≈øunt plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimae leges:</hi> So doeth the life and ≈øtrength of the Law con≈øi≈øt not in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vp infinite and confu≈øed numbers of Lawes, but in the right inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation and good execution of good and whole≈øome Lawes. If this be ≈øo then, neither is this a place on the one ≈øide for euery ra≈øh and harebrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fellow to propone new Lawes of his owne inuention: nay rather I could wi≈øh the≈øe bu≈øie heads to remember that Law of the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, That who≈øoeuer came to propone a new Law to the people, behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued publikely to pre≈øent him≈øelfe with a rope about his necke, that in ca≈øe the Law were not allowed, he ≈øhould be hanged therwith. So warie ≈øhould men be of proponing Nouelties, but mo≈øt of all not to propone any bitter or ≈øeditious Laws, which can produce nothing but grudges and di≈øcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment betweene the Prince and his people. Nor yet is it on the other ≈øide a conuenient place for priuate men vnder the colour of general Lawes,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:23110:275"/>to propone nothing but their owne particular gaine, either to the hurt of their priuate neighbours, or to the hurt of the whole State in generall, which many times vnder faire and plea≈øing Titles, are ≈ømoothly pa≈ø≈øed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and ≈øo by ≈øtealth procure without con≈øideration, that the priuate mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them tendeth to nothing but either to the wrecke of a particular partie, or el≈øe vnder colour of publike benefite to pill the poore people, and ≈øerue as it were for a generall Impo≈øt vpon them for filling the pur≈øes of ≈øome priuate per≈øons.</p>
            <p>And as to the end for which the Parliament is ordeined, being only for the aduancement of Gods glory, and the e≈øtabli≈øhment and wealth of the King and his people: It is no place then for particular men to vtter there their priuate conceipts, nor for ≈øatisfaction of their curio≈øities, and lea≈øt of all to make ≈øhew of their eloquence by tyning the time with long ≈øtudied and eloquent Orations: No, the reuerence of God, their King, and their Countrey being well ≈øetled in their hearts, will make them a≈øhamed of ≈øuch toyes, and remember that they are there as ≈øworne Councellours to their King, to giue their be≈øt adui≈øe for the furtherance of his Seruice, and the flori≈øhing Weale of his E≈øtate.</p>
            <p>And la≈øtly, if you will rightly con≈øider the meanes and wayes how to bring all your labours to a good end, you mu≈øt remember, That you are heere a≈ø≈øembled by your lawfull King to giue him your be≈øt adui≈øes, in the matters propo≈øed by him vnto you, being of that nature, which I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told, wherein you are grauely to deliberate, and vpon your con≈øcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces plainely to determine how farre tho≈øe things propounded doe agree with the weale, both of your King and of your Countrey, who≈øe weales cannot be ≈øeparated. And as for my ≈øelfe, the world ≈øhall euer beare mee witne≈ø≈øe, That I neuer ≈øhall propone any thing vnto you, which ≈øhall not as well tend to the weale publike, as to any benefite for me: So ≈øhall I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer oppone my ≈øelfe to that, which may tend to the good of the Common-wealth, for the which I am ordeined, as I haue often ≈øaid. And as you are to giue your adui≈øe in ≈øuch things as ≈øhall by your King be propo≈øed: So is it on your part your dueties to propone any thing that you can after mature deliberation iudge to be needefull, either for the≈øe ends already ≈øpoken of, or otherwi≈øe for the di≈øcouery of any latent euill in the Kingdome, which peraduenture may not haue commen to the Kings eare. If this then ought to bee your graue maner of proceeding in this place, Men ≈øhould bee a≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make ≈øhew of the quickne≈ø≈øe of their wits here, either in taunting, ≈øcoffing, or detracting the Prince or State in any point, or yet in breaking ie≈øts vpon their fellowes, for which the Ordinaries or Ale-hou≈øes are fitter places, then this Honourable and high Court of Parliament.</p>
            <p>In conclu≈øion then ≈øince you are to breake vp, for the rea≈øons I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told you, I wi≈øh ≈øuch of you as haue any charges in your Countreys, to ha≈øten you home for the repre≈ø≈øing of the in≈øolencies of the≈øe Rebels, and apprehen≈øion of their per≈øons, wherin as I heartily pray to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:23110:276"/>for your pro≈øperous ≈øucce≈ø≈øe: So doe I not doubt, but we ≈øhall ≈øhortly heare the good newes of the ≈øame; And that you ≈øhall haue an happie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and meeting here to all our comforts.</p>
            <q>Here the Lord Chancellor ≈øpake touching the proroguing of the Parliament: And hauing done, his Maiestie ro≈øe againe, and ≈øaid,</q>
            <p>SInce it plea≈øed God to graunt mee two ≈øuch notable Deliueries vpon one day of the weeke, which was Tue≈øday, and likewi≈øe one day of the Moneth, which was the fifth; Thereby to teach mee, That as it was the ≈øame deuill that ≈øtill per≈øecuted mee; So it was one and the ≈øame GOD that ≈øtill mightily deliuered mee: I thought it therefore not ami≈ø≈øe, That the one and twentieth day of Ianuary, which fell to be vpon Tue≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, ≈øhould bee the day of meeting of this next Se≈ø≈øion of Parliament, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and a≈ø≈øuring my ≈øelfe, that the ≈øame GOD, who hath now granted me and you all ≈øo notable and gracious a deliuerie, ≈øhall pro≈øper all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires at that next Se≈ø≈øion, and bring them to an happie conclu≈øion. And now I con≈øider GOD hath well prouided it, that the ending of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath bene ≈øo long continued: For as for my owne part, I neuer had any other intention, but onely to ≈øeeke ≈øo farre my weale, and pro≈øperitie, as might coniunctly ≈øtand with the flouri≈øhing State of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, as I haue often told you; So on the other part I confe≈ø≈øe, if I had bene in your places at the beginning of this Parliament, (which was ≈øo ≈øoone after mine entry into this Kingdome, wherein ye could not po≈ø≈øibly haue ≈øo perfect a knowledge of mine inclination, as experience ≈øince hath taught you,) I could not but haue ≈øu≈øpected, and mi≈ø-interpreted diuers things, In the trying whereof, now I hope, by your experience of my behauiour and forme of gouernment, you are well ynough cleared, and re≈øolued.</p>

For all the time of this long Se≈ø≈øion of the Parliament you haue bene ≈øo fed and cloy'd, (≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially you of the Lower hou≈øe) with ≈øuch banquets, and choi≈øe of delicate ≈øpeeches, and your eares ≈øo ≈øea≈øoned with the ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe of long precogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Orations; as this my Speach now in the breaking vp of this A≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, cannot but appeare vnto your ta≈øte as the wor≈øt Wine propo≈øed in the end of the Banquet, ≈øince I am onely to deliuer now vnto you mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without curious forme, ≈øub≈øtance without ceremonie, trewth in all ≈øinceritie. Yet con≈øidering the Per≈øon that ≈øpeaketh, the parties to whom I ≈øpeake, the matter whereof I meane to ≈øpeake; it fits better to vtter mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:23110:277"/>rather then wordes, in regard of the greatne≈ø≈øe of my place who am to ≈øpeake to you, the grauitie of you the Auditorie, which is the high Court of Parliament; the weight of the matter, which concernes the ≈øecuritie and e≈øtabli≈øhment of this whole Empire, and litle world. Studied Orations and much eloquence vpon little matter is fit for the Vniuer≈øities, where not the Subiect which is ≈øpoken of, but the triall of his wit that ≈øpeaketh, is mo≈øt commendable: but on the contrary, in all great Councels or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, fewe≈øt wordes with mo≈øt matter doeth become be≈øt, where the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of the great errands in hand, and not the prai≈øe of the per≈øon is mo≈øt to bee looked vnto: like the garment of a cha≈øte woman, who is onely ≈øet forth by her naturall beautie, which is properly her owne: other deckings are but en≈øignes of an harlot that flies with borrowed feathers. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides the conueniencie, I am forced hereunto by nece≈ø≈øitie, my place calling me to action, and not leauing me to the libertie of contemplation, hauing alwayes my thoughts bu≈øied with the publique care of you all, where eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you hauing but him≈øelfe, and his owne priuate to thinke of, are at more lei≈øure to make ≈øtudied ≈øpeeches. And therefore the matter which I deliuer you confu≈øedly as in a ≈øacke, I leaue it to you when you are in your chambers, and haue better ley≈øure then I can haue, to ranke them in order, euery one in their owne place.</p>
            <p>Thus much by way of Preface. But I proceed to the matter: Whereof I might ≈øay with <hi>S. Paul,</hi> I could ≈øpeake in as many tongues as you all, but I had rather ≈øpeake three wordes to edification, then talke all day without vnder≈øtanding. In vaine (≈øaith the <hi>P≈øalmist</hi>) doeth the builder build the hou≈øe, or the watchman watch the Citie, vnle≈ø≈øe the Lord giue his ble≈ø≈øing thereunto. And in the New Te≈øtament S. <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith, That hee may plant, <hi>Apollo</hi> may water, but it is GOD onely that mu≈øt giue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe. This I ≈øpeake, becau≈øe of the long time which hath bene≈øpent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Treatie of the Vnion. For my ≈øelfe, I prote≈øt vnto you all, When I fir≈øt propounded the Vnion, I then thought there could haue bene no more que≈øtion of it, then of your declaration and acknowledgement of my right vnto this Crowne, and that as two Twinnes, they would haue growne vp together. The errour was my mi≈øtaking; I knew mine owne ende, but not others feares: But now finding many cro≈ø≈øings, long di≈øputations, ≈øtrange que≈øtions, and nothing done; I mu≈øt needs thinke it proceeds either of mi≈øtaking of the errand, or el≈øe from ≈øome iealou≈øie of me the Propounder, that you ≈øo adde delay vnto delay, ≈øearching out as it were the very bowels of Curio≈øitie, and conclude nothing. Neither can I condemne you for being yet in ≈øome iealou≈øie of my intention in this matter, hauing not yet had ≈øo great experience of my behauiour and inclination in the≈øe few yeeres pa≈øt, as you may peraduenture haue in a longer time hereafter, and not hauing occa≈øion to con≈øult dayly with my ≈øelfe, and heare mine owne opinion in all tho≈øe particulars which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated among you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="511" facs="tcp:23110:277"/>But here I pray you now mi≈øtake mee not at the fir≈øt, when as I ≈øeeme to finde fault with your delayes and curio≈øitie, as if I would haue you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolue in an houres time, that which will take a moneths adui≈øement: for you all know, that <hi>Rex est lex loquens;</hi> And you haue oft heard mee ≈øay, That the Kings will and intention being the ≈øpeaking Law, ought to bee <hi>Luce clarius:</hi> and I hope you of the Lower hou≈øe haue the proofe of this my clearene≈ø≈øe by a Bil ≈øent you downe from the Vpper hou≈øe within the≈øe few dayes, or rather few houres: wherein may very well appeare vnto you the care I haue to put my Subiects in good ≈øecuritie of their po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions for all po≈øterities to come. And therefore that you may clearely vnder≈øtand my meaning in that point, I doe freely confe≈ø≈øe, you had rea≈øon to adui≈øe at lea≈øure vpon ≈øo great a cau≈øe: for great matters doe cuer require great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation before they be well concluded. <hi>Deliberandum est diu quod ≈øtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endum est ≈øemel.</hi> Con≈øultations mu≈øt proceed <hi>lento pede,</hi> but the execution of a ≈øentence vpon the re≈øolution would be ≈øpeedie. If you will goe on, it matters not though you goe with leaden feet, ≈øo you make ≈øtill ≈øome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈ø≈øe, and that there be no let or needle≈ø≈øe delay, and doe not <hi>Nodum in ≈øcirpo quaerere.</hi> I am euer for the <hi>Medium</hi> in euery thing. Betweene fooli≈øh ra≈øhne≈ø≈øe and extreame length, there is a middle way. Search all that is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable, but omit that which is idle, curious and vnnece≈ø≈øary; otherwi≈øe there can neuer be a re≈øolution or end in any good worke.</p>
            <p>And now from the generall I wil de≈øcend to particulars, and wil onely for the ea≈øe of your memories diuide the matter that I am to ≈øpeake of, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to foure heads, by opening vnto you, Fir≈øt, what I craue: Secondly, in what maner I de≈øire it: Thirdly, what commodities will en≈øue to both the Kingdomes by it: Fourthly, what the ≈øuppo≈øed inconueniencie may be that giues impediments thereunto.</p>
            <p>For the fir≈øt, what I craue, I prote≈øt before GOD who knowes my heart, and to you my people before whom it were a ≈øhame to lie, that I claime nothing but with acknowledgement of my Bond to you; that as yee owe to me ≈øubiection and obedience: So my Soueraigntie obligeth mee to yeeld to you loue, gouernment and protection: Neither did I euer wi≈øh any happine≈ø≈øe to my ≈øelfe, which was not conioyned with the happine≈ø≈øe of my people. I de≈øire a perfect Vnion of Lawes and per≈øons, and ≈øuch a Naturalizing as may make one body of both Kingdomes vnder mee your King, That I and my po≈øteritie (if it ≈øo plea≈øe God) may rule ouer you to the worlds ende; Such an Vnion as was of the Scots and Pictes in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and of the Heptarchie here in England. And for Scotland I auow ≈øuch an Vnion, as if you had got it by Conque≈øt, but ≈øuch a Conque≈øt as may be cemented by loue, the onely ≈øure bond of ≈øubiection or friend≈øhip: that as there is ouer both but <hi>vnus Rex,</hi> ≈øo there may be in both but <hi>vnus Grex &amp; vna Lex:</hi> For no more po≈ø≈øible is it for one King to gouerne two Countreys <hi>Contiguous,</hi> the one a great, the other a le≈ø≈øe, a richer and a poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, the greater drawing like an Adamant the le≈ø≈øer to the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:23110:278"/>thereof, then for one head to gouerne two bodies, or one man to be husband of two wiues, whereof Chri≈øt him≈øelfe ≈øaid, <hi>Ab initio non fuit ≈øic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the generall Vnion you mu≈øt ob≈øerue two things: for I will di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer my thoughts plainly vnto you; I ≈øtudy clearenes, not eloquence, And therefore with the olde Philo≈øopers, I would heartily wi≈øh my bre≈øt were a tran≈øparent gla≈ø≈øe for you all to ≈øee through, that you might looke into my heart, and then would you be ≈øatisfied of my meaning. For when I ≈øpeake of a perfect Vnion, I meane not confu≈øion of all things: you mu≈øt not take from Scotland tho≈øe particular Priuiledges that may ≈øtand as well with this Vnion, as in England many particular cu≈øtomes in particular Shires, (as the Cu≈øtomes of Kent, and the Royalties of the Countie Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine of Che≈øter) do with the Common Law of the Kingdome: for euery particular Shire almo≈øt, and much more euery Countie, haue ≈øome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular cu≈øtomes that are as it were naturally mo≈øt fit for that people. But I meane of ≈øuch a generall Vnion of Lawes as may reduce the whole Iland, that as they liue already vnder one Monarch, ≈øo they may all bee gouerned by one Law: For I mu≈øt needs confe≈ø≈øe by that little experience I haue had ≈øince my comming hither, and I thinke I am able to prooue it, that the grounds of the Common Law of England, are the be≈øt of any Law in the world, either Ciuil or Municipall, and the fitte≈øt for this people. But as euery Law would be cleare and full, ≈øo the ob≈øcuritie in ≈øome points of this our written Law, and want of fulne≈ø≈øe in others, the variation of Ca≈øes and mens curio≈øitie, breeding euery day new que≈øtions, hath enforced the Iudges to iudge in many Ca≈øes here, by Ca≈øes and pre≈øidents, wherein I hope Lawyers them≈øelues will not denie but that there mu≈øt be a great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie, and I am ≈øure all the re≈øt of you that are Gentlemen of other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øions were long agoe wearie of it, if you could haue had it amended: For where there is varietie and vncertaintie although a iu≈øt Iudge may do right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet an ill Iudge may take aduantage to doe wrong; and then are all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt men that ≈øucceede him, tied in a maner to his vniu≈øt and partiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øions. Wherefore, leaue not the Law to the plea≈øure of the Iudge, but let your Lawes be looked into: for I de≈øire not the aboli≈øhing of the Lawes, but onely the clearing and the ≈øweeping off the ru≈øt of them, and that by Parliament our Lawes might be cleared and made knowen to all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. Yea rather it were le≈ø≈øe hurt, that all the approued Ca≈øes were ≈øet downe and allowed by Parliament for ≈øtanding Lawes in all time to come: For although ≈øome of them peraduenture may bee vniu≈øt as ≈øet downe by corrupt Iudges; yet better it is to haue a certaine Law with ≈øome ≈øpots in it, nor liue vnder ≈øuch an vncertaine and arbitrarie Law, ≈øince as the prouerbe is, It is le≈ø≈øe harme to ≈øuffer an inconuenience then a mi≈øchiefe. And now may you haue faire occa≈øion of amending and poli≈øhing your Lawes, when Scotland is to bee vnited with you vnder them for who can blame Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to ≈øay, If you will take away our owne Lawes, I pray you giue vs a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and cleerer in place thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="513" facs="tcp:23110:278"/>But this is not po≈ø≈øible to bee done without a fit preparation. Hee that buildeth a Ship, mu≈øt fir≈øt prouide the timber; and as Chri≈øt him≈øelfe ≈øaid, No man will build an hou≈øe, but he will fir≈øt prouide the materials: nor a wi≈øe King will not make warre again≈øt another, without he fir≈øt makepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui≈øion of money: and all great workes mu≈øt haue their preparation: and that was my end in cau≈øing the In≈øtrument of the Vnion to be made.

The vnion is an eternall agreement and reconciliation of many long bloody warres that haue beene betweene the≈øe two ancient Kingdomes. Is it the readie≈øt way to agree a priuate quarell betweene two, to bring them at the fir≈øt to ≈øhake hands, and as it were ki≈ø≈øe other, and lie vnder one roofe or rather in one bedde together, before that fir≈øt the ground of their quarell be communed vpon, their mindes mitigated, their affections prepared, and all other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances fir≈øt v≈øed, that ought to be v≈øed to proceed to ≈øuch a finall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Euery hone≈øt man de≈øireth a perfect Vnion, but they that ≈øay ≈øo, and admit no preparation thereto, haue <hi>mel in ore, fel in corde.</hi> If after your ≈øo long talke of Vnion in all this long Se≈ø≈øion of Parliament, yee ri≈øe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out agreeing vpon any particular; what will the neighbour Princes iudge, who≈øe eyes are all fixed vpon the conclu≈øion of this Action, but that the King is refu≈øed in his de≈øire, whereby the Nation ≈øhould bee taxed, and the King di≈øgraced? And what an ill preparation is it for the mindes of Scotland toward the Vnion, when they ≈øhall heare that ill is ≈øpoken of their whole Nation, but nothing is done nor aduanced in the matter of the Vnion it ≈øelfe? But this I am glad was but the fault of one, and one is no number: yet haue your neighbours of Scotland this aduantage of you, that none of them haue ≈øpoken ill of you (nor ≈øhall as long as I am King) in Parliament, or any ≈øuch publique place of Iuditature. Con≈øider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well, if the mindes of Scotland had not neede to be well prepared to per≈øwade their mutuall con≈øent, ≈øeeing you here haue all the great aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by the Vnion. Is not here the per≈øonall re≈øidence of the King, his whole Court and family? Is not here the ≈øeate of Iu≈øtice, and the fountaine of Gouernment? mu≈øt they not be ≈øubiected to the Lawes of England, and ≈øo with time become but as Cumberland and Northumberland, and tho≈øe other remote and Northerne Shires? you are to be the husband, they the wife: you conquerours, they as conquered, though not by the ≈øword, but by the ≈øweet and ≈øure bond of loue. Be≈øides that, they as other Northerne Countreys will be≈øeldome ≈øeene and ≈øaluted by their King, and that as it were but in a po≈øting or hunting iourney.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="514" facs="tcp:23110:279"/>How little cau≈øe then they may haue of ≈øuch a change of ≈øo ancient a Monarchie into the ca≈øe of priuate Shires, iudge rightly herein. And that you may be the more vpright Iudges, ≈øuppo≈øe your ≈øelues the Patients of whom ≈øuch ≈øentence ≈øhould be giuen. But what preparation is it which I craue? onely ≈øuch as by the entrance may ≈øhew ≈øomething is done, yet more is intended. There is a conceipt intertained, and a double iealou≈øie po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth many, wherein I am mi≈øiudged.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, that this Vnion will be the <hi>Cri≈øis</hi> to the ouerthrow of England, and ≈øetting vp of Scotland: England will then bee ouerwhelmed by the ≈øwarming of the Scots, who if the Vnion were effected, would raigne and rule all.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond is, my profu≈øe liberalitie to the Scotti≈øh men more then the Engli≈øh, and that with this Vnion all things ≈øhalbe giuen to them, and you turned out of all: To you ≈øhall bee left the ≈øweat and labour, to them ≈øhall bee giuen the fruite and ≈øweet; and that my forbearance is but till this Vnion may be gained. How agreeable this is to the trewth, Iudge you; And that not by my wordes, but by my Actions. Doe I craue the Vnion without exceptions? doe I not offer to binde my ≈øelfe and to re≈øerue to you, as in the In≈øtrument, all places of Iudicature? doe I intend any thing which ≈øtandeth not with the equall good of both Nations? I could then haue done it, and not ≈øpoken of it: For all men of vnder≈øtanding mu≈øt agree, that I might di≈øpo≈øe without a≈ø≈øent of Parliament, Offices of Iudicature, and others, both Eccle≈øia≈øticall and Temporall: But herein I did voluntarily offer by my Letters from Roy≈øton to the Commi≈ø≈øioners, to bind my Prerogatiue.</p>
            <p>Some thinke that I will draw the Scotti≈øh Nation hither, talking idlely of tran≈øporting of Trees out of a barren ground into a better, and of leane cattell out of bad pa≈øture into a more fertile ≈øoile. Can any man di≈øplant you, vnle≈ø≈øe you will? or can any man thinke that Scotland is ≈øo ≈øtrong to pull you out of your hou≈øes? or doe you not thinke I know England hath more people, Scotland more wa≈øt ground? So that there is roumth in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land rather to plant your idle people that ≈øwarme in London ≈øtreets, and other Townes, and di≈øburden you of them, then to bring more vnto you; And in ca≈øes of Iu≈øtice, if I bee partiall to either ≈øide, let my owne mouth condemne me, as vnworthy to be your King.</p>
            <p>I appeale to your ≈øelues, if in fauour or Iu≈øtice I haue beene partiall: Nay, my intention was euer, you ≈øhould then haue mo≈øt cau≈øe to prai≈øe my di≈øcretion, when you ≈øaw I had mo≈øt power. If hitherto I haue done nothing to your preiudice, much le≈ø≈øe meane I hereafter. If when I might haue done it without any breach of promi≈øe; Thinke ≈øo of mee, that much le≈ø≈øe I will doe it, when a Law is to re≈øtraine me. I owe no more to the Scotti≈øh men then to the Engli≈øh. I was borne there, and ≈øworne here, and now raigne ouer both. Such particular per≈øons of the Scotti≈øh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as might claime any extraordinary merit at my handes, I haue already
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:23110:279"/>rea≈øonably rewarded, and I can a≈ø≈øure you that there is none left, whom for I meane extraordinary to ≈øtraine my ≈øelfe further, then in ≈øuch ordinary benefit as I may equally be≈øtow without mine owne great hurt, vpon any Subiect of either Nation; In which ca≈øe no Kings handes can euer befully clo≈øed. To both I owe Iu≈øtice and protection, which with Gods grace I ≈øhall euer equally ballance.</p>
            <p>For my Liberalitie, I haue told you of it heretofore: my three fir≈øt yeeres were to me as a Chri≈øtmas, I could not then be mi≈øerable: ≈øhould I haue bene ouer≈øparing to them? they might haue thought <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> had forgotten his brethren, or that the King had beene drunke with his new Kingdome. But Suites goe not now ≈øo cheape as they were wont, neither are there ≈øo many fees taken in the Hamper and Pettibagge for the great Seale as hath beene. And if I did re≈øpect the Engli≈øh when I came fir≈øt, of whom I was receiued with ioy, and came as in a hunting iourney, what might the Scotti≈øh haue iu≈øtly ≈øaid, if I had not in ≈øome mea≈øure dealt bountifully with them that ≈øo long had ≈øerued me, ≈øo farre aduentured them≈øelues with me, and beene ≈øo faithfull to mee. I haue giuen you now foure yeeres proofe ≈øince my comming, and what I might haue done more to haue rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed the Scotti≈øh nation you all know, and the longer I liue, the le≈ø≈øe cau≈øe haue I to be acquainted with them, and ≈øo the le≈ø≈øe hope of extraordinary fauour towards them: For ≈øince my comming from them I doe not alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die know the one halfe of them by face, mo≈øt of the youth being now ri≈øen vp to bee men, who were but children when I was there, and more are borne ≈øince my comming thence.</p>
            <p>Now for my lands and reuenues of my Crowne which you may thinke I haue dimini≈øhed, They are not yet ≈øo farre dimini≈øhed, but that I thinke no prince of Chri≈øtendome hath fairer po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions to his Crowne then yet I haue: and in token of my care to pre≈øerue the ≈øame to my po≈øteritie for euer, the intaile of my lands to the Crowne hath beene long agoe offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto you: and that it is not yet done, is not my fault as you know. My Trea≈øurer here knoweth my care, and hath already in part declared it, and if I did not hope to treble my Reuenue more then I haue empai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, I ≈øhould neuer re≈øt quietly in my bed. But notwith≈øtanding my comming to the Crowne, with that extraordinarie applau≈øe which you all know, and that I had two Nations to bee the obiects of my libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, which neuer any Prince had here before; will you compare my gifts out of mine inheritance with ≈øome Princes here that had onely this Nation to re≈øpect, and who≈øe whole time of reigne was litle longer then mine hath bene already? It will be found that their gifts haue farre ≈øurpa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed mine, albeit as I haue already ≈øaid, they had nothing ≈øo great cau≈øe of v≈øing their liberalitie.</p>
            <p>For the maner of the Vnion pre≈øently de≈øired, It ≈øtandeth in 3. parts:
<note place="margin">Secondly</note> The fir≈øt, taking away of ho≈øtile Lawes: for ≈øince there can bee now no Warres betwixt you, is it not rea≈øon ho≈øtile Lawes ≈øhould cea≈øe?
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:23110:280"/>For, <hi>de≈øiciente cau≈øa de≈øicit effectas.</hi> The King of England now cannot haue warres with the King of Scotland, therefore this failes of it ≈øelfe. The ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is communitie of Commerce. I am no ≈øtranger vnto you: for you all know I came from the loynes of your ancient Kings. They of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land be my Subiects as you are. But how can I bee naturall Liege Lord to you both, and you ≈øtrangers one to the other? Shall they which be of one alleagance with you, be no better re≈øpected of you, nor freer among≈øt you, then Frenchmen and Spaniards? Since I am Soueraigne ouer both, you as Subiects to one King, it mu≈øt needes follow that you conuer≈øe and haue Commerce together. There is a rumour of ≈øome ill dealings that ≈øhould be v≈øed by the Commi≈ø≈øioners, Merchants of Scotland. They be heere in England, and ≈øhall remaine till your next meeting, and abide triall, to prooue them≈øelues either hone≈øt men or knaues.</p>
            <p>For the third point,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of Naturalization, All you agree that they are no Aliens, and yet will not allow them to bee naturall. What kinde of prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue will you make?

I doe not denie but Iudges may erre as men, and therefore I doe not pre≈ø≈øe you here to ≈øweare to all their rea≈øons. I onely vrge at this time the conueniencie for both Kingdomes, neither pre≈ø≈øing you to iudge nor to be iudged. But remember al≈øo it is as po≈ø≈øible and likely your owne Lawyers may erre as the Iudges: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as I wi≈øh you to proceede herein ≈øo farre as may tend to the weale of both Nations; So would I haue you on the other part to beware to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace either my Proclamations or the Iudges, who when the Parliament is done, haue power to trie your lands and liues, for ≈øo you may di≈øgrace both your King and your Lawes. For the doing of any acte that may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure le≈ø≈øe reuerence to the Iudges, cannot but breede a loo≈øene≈ø≈øe in the Gouernement, and a di≈øgrace to the whole Nation. The rea≈øon that mo≈øt mooues mee for ought I haue yet heard, that there cannot but bee a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the <hi>Ant√® nati</hi> and the <hi>Po≈øt nati,</hi> and that in the fauour of the la≈øt, is that they mu≈øt bee neerer vnto you being borne vnder the pre≈øent Gouernement and common Allegiance: but in point of conueniencie, there is no que≈øtion but the <hi>Po≈øt nati</hi> are more to bee re≈øpected: For if you would haue a perfect and perpetuall Vnion, that cannot be in the <hi>Ant√® nati,</hi> who are but few in compari≈øon of tho≈øe that ≈øhall be in all aages ≈øuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and cannot liue long. But in the <hi>Po≈øt nati</hi> ≈øhall the Vnion be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and liue euer aage after aage, which wanting a difference cannot but leaue a perpetuall marke of ≈øeparation in the worke of the Vnion: as al≈øo that argument of iealou≈øie will be ≈øo farre remooued in the ca≈øe of the <hi>Po≈øt nati</hi> which are to reape the benefit in all ≈øucceeding aages, as by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary there will then ri≈øe <hi>Pharaos</hi> which neuer knew <hi>Io≈øeph.</hi> The Kings my
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:23110:280"/>Succe≈ø≈øours, who beeing borne and bred heere, can neuer haue more occa≈øion of acquaintance with the Scotti≈øh Nation in generall, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Engli≈øh King that was before my time. Bee not therefore abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed with the flattering ≈øpeeches of ≈øuch as would haue the <hi>Ante nati</hi> preferred, alleadging their merit in my Seruice, and ≈øuch other rea≈øons which indeede are but Sophi≈ømes: For, my rewarding out of my Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of any particular men, hath nothing adoe with the generall acte of the Vnion, which mu≈øt not regard the de≈øerts of priuate per≈øons, but the generall weale and conioyning of the Nations. Be≈øides that, the actuall Naturalizing, which is the onely point that is in your handes, is already graunted to by your ≈øelues to the mo≈øt part of ≈øuch particular per≈øons as can haue any v≈øe of it heere: and if any other well de≈øeruing men were to ≈øue for it hereafter, I doubt not but there would neuer bee que≈øtion mooued among you for the granting of it. And therefore it is mo≈øt euident, that ≈øuch di≈øcour≈øers haue <hi>mel in ore, fel in corde,</hi> as I ≈øaid before; carying an outward appearance of loue to the Vnion, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a contrary re≈øolution in their hearts. And as for limitations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrictions, ≈øuch as ≈øhall by me be agreed vpon to be rea≈øonable and nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary after you haue fully debated vpon them, you may a≈ø≈øure your ≈øelues I will with indifferencie grant what is requi≈øite without partiall re≈øpect of Scotland. I am, as I haue often ≈øaid, borne and ≈øworne King ouer both Kingdomes; onely this farre let me entreat you, in debating the point at your next meeting, That yee be as ready to re≈øolue doubts as to mooue them, and to be ≈øatisfied when doubts are cleered.</p>
            <p>And as for Commodities that come by the Vnion of the≈øe Kingdoms, they are great and euident; Peace, Plentie, Loue, free Intercour≈øe and common Societie of two great Nations. All forreigne Kings that haue ≈øent their Amba≈ø≈øadours to congratulate with me ≈øince my comming, haue ≈øaluted me as Monarch of the whole I≈øle, and with much more re≈øpect of my greatne≈ø≈øe, then if I were King alone of one of the≈øe Realmes: and with what comfort doe your ≈øelues behold Iri≈øh, Scotti≈øh, Wel≈øh, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli≈øh, diuers in Nation, yet all walking as Subiects and ≈øeruants within my Court, and all liuing vnder the allegiance of your King, be≈øides the honour and lu≈øtre that the encrea≈øe of gallant men in the Court of diuers Nations carries in the eyes of all ≈øtrangers that repaire hither? Tho≈øe confining places which were the Borders of the two Kingdomes, where heretofore much blood was ≈øhed, and many of your ance≈øtours lo≈øt their liues; yea, that lay wa≈øte and de≈øolate, and were habitations but for run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagates, are now become the Nauell or Vmbilick of both Kingdomes, planted and peopled with Ciuilitie and riches: their Churches begin to bee planted, their doores ≈øtand now open, they feare neither robbing nor ≈øpoiling: and where there was nothing before heard nor ≈øeene in tho≈øe parts but blood≈øhed, oppre≈ø≈øions, complaints and outcries, they now liue euery man peaceably vnder his owne figgetree, and all their
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:23110:281"/>former cryes and complaints turned onely into prayers to God for their King, vnder whom they enioy ≈øuch ea≈øe and happy quietne≈ø≈øe. The Marches beyond and on this ≈øide Twede, are as fruitfull and as peaceable as mo≈øt parts of England: If after all this there ≈øhall be a Sci≈ø≈øure, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience will follow, iudge you.</p>
            <p>And as for the inconueniences that are feared on Englands part, It is alleadged, that the Scots are a populous Nation, they ≈øhall be harboured in our ne≈øts, they ≈øhall be planted and flouri≈øh in our good Soile, they ≈øhall eate our commons bare, and make vs leane: The≈øe are fooli≈øh and idle ≈øurmi≈øes. That which you po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe, they are not to enioy; by Law they cannot, nor by my partialitie they ≈øhall not: for ≈øet apart con≈øcience and honour, (which if I ≈øhould ≈øet apart indeede, I had rather wi≈øh my ≈øelfe to bee ≈øet apart and out of all being) can any man conclude either out of common rea≈øon or good policie, that I will preferre tho≈øe which perhaps I ≈øhall neuer ≈øee, or but by po≈øte for a moneth, before tho≈øe with whom I mu≈øt alwayes dwell? Can they conquer or ouercome you with ≈øwarmes of people, as the Goths and the Vandals did <hi>Italy?</hi> Surely the world knowes they are nothing ≈øo populous as you are: and although they haue had the honour and good fortune neuer to be conquered, yet were they euer but vpon the defen≈øiue part, and may in a part thanke their hilles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acce≈ø≈øible pa≈ø≈øages that pre≈øerued them from an vtter ouerthrow at the handes of all that pretended to conquer them. Or are they ≈øo very poore and mi≈øerable in their owne habitations, that nece≈ø≈øitie ≈øhould force them all to make incur≈øions among you?</p>
            <p>And for my part, when I haue two Nations vnder my gouernment, can you imagine I will re≈øpect the le≈ø≈øer, and neglect the greater? would I not thinke it a le≈ø≈øe euill and hazard to mee that the plague were at Northampton or Barwicke, then at London, ≈øo neere We≈øtmin≈øter, the Seat of my habitation, and of my wife and children? will not a man bee more carefull to quench the fire taken in his neere≈øt neighbours hou≈øe, then if a whole Towne were a fire farre from him? You know that I am carefull to pre≈øerue the woods and game through all England, nay, through all the I≈øle: yet none of you doubts, but that I would be more offended with any di≈øorder in the Forre≈øt of Waltham, for ≈øtealing of a Stagge there, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as it were vnder my no≈øe, and in a manerioyneth with my garden, then with cutting of timber, or ≈øtealing of a Deare in any Forre≈øt of the North parts of Yorke≈øhire or the Bi≈øhopricke. Thinke you that I will preferre them that be ab≈øent, le≈ø≈øe powerfull, and farther off to doe me good or hurt, before you, with whom my ≈øecurity and liuing mu≈øt be, and where I de≈øire to plant my po≈øterity? If I might by any ≈øuch fauours rai≈øe my ≈øelfe to a greatne≈ø≈øe, it might bee probable: All I cannot draw, and to lo≈øe a whole ≈øtate here to plea≈øe a few there, were madne≈ø≈øe. I neede ≈øpeake no more of this with prote≈øtations. Speake but of wit, it is not likely: and to doubt of my intention in this, were more then deuili≈øh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="519" facs="tcp:23110:281"/>For mine owne part, I offer more then I receiue, and conueniencie I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre before law, in this point. For, three parts, wherein I might hurt this Nation, by partiality to the Scots, you know doe ab≈øolutely lie in my hands and power: for either in di≈øpo≈øition of rents, or what≈øoeuer benefit, or in the preferring of them to any dignitie or office, ciuill or Eccle≈øia≈øticall, or in calling them to the Parliament, it doeth all fully and onely lie within the compa≈ø≈øe of my Prerogatiue, which are the parts wherein the Scotti≈øh men can receiue either benefite or preferment by the Vnion, and wherein for the care I haue of this people, I am content to binde my ≈øelfe with ≈øome rea≈øonable re≈øtrictions.</p>
            <p>As for the fourth part, the Naturalizing, which onely lieth in your hands; It is the point wherein they receiue lea≈øt benefit of any: for in that they can obteine nothing, but what they buy by their pur≈øe, or acquire by the ≈øelfe ≈øame meanes that you doe. And as for the point of naturalizing, which is the point thought ≈øo fit, and ≈øo preci≈øely belonging to Parliament; not to ≈øpeake of the Common law, wherein as yet I can profe≈ø≈øe no great knowledge, but in the Ciuill law wherein I am a little better ver≈øed, and which in the point of Coniunction of Nations ≈øhould beare a great ≈øway, it being the Law of Nations; I will mainteine two principles in it, which no learned and graue Ciuilian will deny, as being clearely to be proued, both out of the text it ≈øelfe in many places, and al≈øo out of the be≈øt approued Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours and interpreters of that law; The one, that it is a ≈øpeciall point of the Kings owne Prerogatiue, to make Aliens Citizens, and <hi>donare Ciuitate;</hi> The other, that in any ca≈øe wherein the Law is thought not to be cleare (as ≈øome of your ≈øelues doe doubt, that in this ca≈øe of the <hi>po≈øtnati,</hi> the Law of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land doth not clearely determine) then in ≈øuch a que≈øtion wherein no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitiue Law is re≈øolute, <hi>Rexe≈øt Iudex,</hi> for he is <hi>Lex loquens,</hi> and is to ≈øupply the Law, where the Law wants, and if many famous hi≈øtories be to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, they giue the example for mainteining of this Law in the per≈øons of the Kings of England and France e≈øpecially, who≈øe ≈øpeciall Prerogatiue they alleadge it to be. But this I ≈øpeake onely as knowing what belongeth to a King, although in this ca≈øe I pre≈ø≈øe no further then that which may agree with your loues, and ≈øtand with the weale and conueniencie of both Nations.</p>
            <p>And whereas ≈øome may thinke this Vnion will bring preiudice to ≈øome Townes and Corporations within England; It may bee, a Merchant or two of Bri≈øtow, or Yarmouth, may haue an hundred pounds le≈ø≈øe in his packe: But if the Empire gaine, and become the greater, it is no matter: You ≈øee one Corporation is euer again≈øt another, and no priuate Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie can be ≈øet vp, but with ≈øome lo≈ø≈øe to another.</p>
            <p>For the ≈øuppo≈øed inconueniences ri≈øing from Scotland, they are three.
<note place="margin">Fourth.</note> Fir≈øt, that there is an euill affection in the Scotti≈øh Nation to the Vnion. Next, the Vnion is incompatible betweene two ≈øuch Nations. Thirdly, that the gaine is ≈ømal or none. If this be ≈øo, to what end do we talke of an Vnion?
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:23110:282"/>For proofe of the fir≈øt point, there is alleadged an auer≈øene≈ø≈øe in the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øh Nation expre≈ø≈øed in the In≈øtrument, both in the preface and body of their Acte; In the preface, where they declare, That they will remaine an ab≈øolute and free Monarchie; And in the body of the Acte, where they make an exception of the ancient fundamentall Lawes of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And fir≈øt for the generall of their auer≈øenes, All the maine cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in your Lower-hou≈øe ranne this whole Se≈ø≈øion of Parliament with that opinion, That Scotland was ≈øo greedy of this Vnion, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they ≈øhould receiue ≈øo much benefit by it, as they cared not for the ≈øtrictne≈ø≈øe of any conditions, ≈øo they might attaine to the ≈øub≈øtance<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> And yet you now ≈øay, they are backwards and auer≈øe from the Vnion. This is a direct contradiction <hi>In adiecto:</hi> For how can they both be beggers and backwards, in one and the ≈øelfe ≈øame thing, at the ≈øame time?</p>
            <p>But for an≈øwere to the particulars, It is an old Schoole point, <hi>Eius est explicare, cuius est condere.</hi> You cannot interpret their Lawes, nor they yours; I that made them with their a≈ø≈øent, can be≈øt expound them.</p>
            <p>And fir≈øt I confe≈ø≈øe, that the Engli≈øh Parliaments are ≈øo long, and the Scotti≈øh ≈øo ≈øhort, that a meane betweene them would doe well: For the ≈øhortne≈ø≈øe of their continuing together, was the cau≈øe of their ha≈øtie mi≈øtaking, by ≈øetting the≈øe wordes of exception of fundamentall Lawes in the body of the Acte, which they onely did in pre≈ø≈øing to imitate word by word the Engli≈øh In≈øtrument, wherein the ≈øame wordes be conteined in your Preface. And as to their meaning and interpretation of that word, I will not onely deliuer it vnto you out of mine owne conceipt, but as it was deliuered vnto mee by the be≈øt Lawyers of Scotland, both Coun≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and other Lawyers, who were at the making thereof in Scotland, and were Commi≈ø≈øioners here for performance of the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>Their meaning in the word of Fundamentall Lawes, you ≈øhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue more fully hereafter, when I handle the obiection of the difference of Lawes: For they intend thereby onely tho≈øe Lawes whereby confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion is auoyded, and their Kings de≈øcent mainteined, and the heritage of the ≈øucce≈ø≈øion and Monarchie, which hath bene a Kingdome, to which I am in de≈øcent, three hundreth yeeres before CHRIST: Not meaning it as you doe, of their Common Law, for they haue none, but that which is called IVS REGIS: and their de≈øire of continuing a free Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, was onely meant, That all ≈øuch particular Priuiledges (whereof I ≈øpake before) ≈øhould not bee ≈øo confounded, as for want either of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrate, Law, or Order, they might fall in ≈øuch a confu≈øion, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like a naked Prouince, without Law or libertie vnder this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. I hope you meane not I ≈øhould ≈øet Garri≈øons ouer them, as the Spaniards doe ouer Sicily and Naples, or gouerne them by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioners, which are ≈øeldome found ≈øucceedingly all wi≈øe and hone≈øt men.</p>
            <p>This I mu≈øt ≈øay for Scotland, and I may trewly vaunt it; Here I ≈øit and
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:23110:282"/>gouerne it with my Pen, I write and it is done, and by a Clearke of the Councell I gouerne Scotland now, which others could not doe by the ≈øword. And for their auer≈øen≈ø≈øe in their heart again≈øt the Vnion, It is trew indeede, I prote≈øt they did neuer craue this Vnion of me, nor ≈øought it either in priuate, or the State by letters, nor euer once did any of that Nation pre≈ø≈øe mee forward or wi≈øh mee to accelerate that bu≈øine≈ø≈øe. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, they offered alwayes to obey mee when it ≈øhould come to them, and all hone≈øt men that de≈øire my greatne≈ø≈øe haue beene thus minded, for the per≈øonall reuerence and regard they beare vnto my Perion, and any of my rea≈øonable and iu≈øt de≈øires.</p>
            <p>I know there are many <hi>Piggots</hi> among≈øt them, I meane a number of ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious and di≈øcontented particular per≈øons, as mu≈øt be in all Common-wealths, that where they dare, may peraduenture talke lewdly enough: but no Scotti≈øh man euer ≈øpake dishonourably of England in Parliament. For here mu≈øt I note vnto you the difference of the two Parliaments in the≈øe two Kingdomes; for there they mu≈øt not ≈øpeake without the Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors leaue, and if any man doe propound or vtter any ≈øeditious or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely ≈øpeeches, he is ≈øtraight interrupted and ≈øilenced by the Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors authoritie: where as here, the libertie for any man to ≈øpeake what hee li≈øt, and as long as he li≈øt, was the onely cau≈øe he was not interrupted.</p>
            <p>It hath bin obiected, that there is a great Antipathy of the Lawes and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtomes of the≈øe two Nations. It is much mi≈øtaken: for Scotland hath no Common Law as here, but the Law they haue is of three ≈øorts.</p>
            <p>All the Lawe of Scotland for Tenures, Wards and Liueries, Seigniories and Lands, are drawen out of the Chauncerie of England, and for matters of equitie and in many things el≈øe, differs from you but in certaine termes: <hi>Iames</hi> the fir≈øt, bred here in England, brought the Lawes thither in a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hand. The ≈øecond is Statute lawes, which be their Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein they haue power as you, to make and altar Lawes: and tho≈øe may be looked into by you, for I hope you ≈øhall be no more ≈øtrangers to that Nation. And the principall worke of this Vnion will be, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Statute Lawes of both Kingdomes. The third is the Ciuill Law: <hi>Iames</hi> the fift brought it out of France by e≈øtabli≈øhing the Se≈ø≈øion there, according to the forme of the Court of Parliament of Fraunce, which he had ≈øeene in the time of his being there: who occupie there the place of Ciuill! udges in all matters of Plee or controuer≈øie, yet not to gouerne ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolutely by the Ciuill Law as in Fraunce. For if a man plead that the Law of the Nation is otherwi≈øe, it is a barre to the Ciuill, and a good Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor or Pre≈øident, will oftentimes repell and put to ≈øilence an Argument that the Lawyers bring out of the Ciuill Law, where they haue a cleare ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in their owne Law. So as the Ciuil Law in Scotland is admitted in no other ca≈øes, but to ≈øupply ≈øuch ca≈øes wherein the Municipall Law is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue. Then may you ≈øee it is not ≈øo hard a matter as is thought, to reduce that Countrey to bee vnited with you vnder this Law, which neither are
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:23110:283"/>≈øubiect to the Ciuill Lawe, nor yet haue any olde Common Law of their owne, but ≈øuch as in effect is borrowed from yours. And for their Statute Lawes in Parliament, you may alter and change them as oft as occa≈øion ≈øhall require, as you doe here. It hath likewi≈øe beene obiected as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impediment, that in the Parliament of Scotland the King hath not anegatiue voice, but mu≈øt pa≈ø≈øe all the Lawes agreed on by the Lords and Commons. Of this I can be≈øt re≈øolue you: for I am the elde≈øt Parliament man in Scotland, and haue ≈øit in more Parliaments then any of my Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øors. I can a≈ø≈øure you, that the forme of Parliament there, is nothing inclined to popularitie. About a twentie dayes or ≈øuch a time before the Parliament, Proclamation is made throughout the Kingdome, to deliuer in to the Kings Clearke of Regi≈øter (whom you heere call the Ma≈øter of the Rolles) all Bills to be exhibited that Se≈ø≈øion before a certaine day. Then are they brought vnto the King, and peru≈øed and con≈øidered by him, and onely ≈øuch as I allowe of are put into the Chancellors handes to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to the Parliament, and none others; And if any man in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ≈øpeake of any other matter then is in this forme fir≈øt allowed by mee, The Chancellor tells him there is no ≈øuch Bill allowed by the King.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides, when they haue pa≈ø≈øed them for lawes, they are pre≈øented vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and I with my Scepter put into my hand by the Chancellor, mu≈øt ≈øay, <hi>I ratifie and approue all things done in this pre≈øent Parliament.</hi> And if there bee any thing that I di≈ølike, they ra≈øe it out before. If this may bee called a negatiue voyce, then I haue one I am ≈øure in that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The la≈øt impediment is the French liberties: which is thought ≈øo great, as except the Scots far≈øake Fraunce, England cannot bee vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them. If the Scotti≈øh Nation would bee ≈øo vnwilling to leaue them as is ≈øaid, it would not lye in their hands: For the League was neuer made betweene the people, as is mi≈øtaken, but betwixt the <hi>Princes</hi> onely and their Crownes. The beginning was by a Me≈ø≈øage from a King of Fraunce, <hi>Charlemaine</hi> I take it (but I cannot certainely remember) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a King of Scotland, for a League defen≈øiue and offen≈øiue betweene vs and them again≈øt England, Fraunce being at that time in Warres with England.</p>
            <p>The like at that time was then de≈øired by England again≈øt Fraunce, who al≈øo ≈øent their Amba≈ø≈øadours to Scotland. At the fir≈øt, the Di≈øpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was long maintained in fauour of England, that they being our neere≈øt Neighbours ioyned in one continent, and a ≈øtrong and powerfull Nation, it was more fitte for the weale and ≈øecuritie of the State of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to be in League and Amitie with them, then with a Countrey, though neuer ≈øo ≈øtrong, yet diuided by Sea from vs: e≈øpecially Englandlying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs and them, where we might be ≈øure of a ≈øuddaine mi≈øchiefe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooued to abide the hazard of wind and weather, and other accidents that might hinder our reliefe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="523" facs="tcp:23110:283"/>But after, when the contrary part of the Argument was maintained: wherein allegation was made, that England euer ≈øought to conquer Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and therefore in regarde of their pretended intere≈øt in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doome, would neuer keepe any ≈øound Amitie with them longer, then they ≈øaw their aduantage; whereas France lying more remote and clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming no intere≈øt in the Kingdome, would therefore bee found a more con≈øtant and faithfull friend: It was vnhappily concluded in fauour of the la≈øt partie, through which occa≈øion Scotland gate many mi≈øchiefes after: And it is by the very tenour thereof ordered, to bee renewed and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from King to King ≈øucce≈ø≈øiuely, which accordingly was euer perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the mediation of their Amba≈ø≈øadours, and therefore meerely per≈øonall, and ≈øo was it renewed in the Queene my mothers time, onely betweene the two Kings, and not by a≈ø≈øent of Parliament or conuention of the three E≈øtates, which it could neuer haue wanted if it had beene a League betweene the people. And in my time when it came to be ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becau≈øe it appeared to be in <hi>odium tertii,</hi> it was by me left vnrenewed or confirmed as a thing incompatible to my Per≈øon, in con≈øideration of my Title to this Crowne. Some Priuiledges indeede in the Merchants fauour for point of Commerce, were renewed and confirmed in my time: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for my part of it, there was ≈øcarce three Coun≈øellours more then my Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie, to who≈øe place it belonged, that medled in that matter.</p>
            <p>It is trew, that it behooued to be enterteined, as they call it, in the Court of Parliament of <hi>Paris:</hi> but that onely ≈øerues for publication, and not to giue it Authoritie: That Parliament (as you know) being but a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall Seate of Iudges and Lawyers, and nothing agreeing with the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition or office of our Parliaments in this I≈øle. And therefore that any fruites or Priuiledges po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed by the League with Fraunce is able now to remaine in Scotland, is impo≈ø≈øible: For ye may be ≈øure, that the French King ≈øtayes onely vpon the ≈øight of the ending of this Vnion, to cut it off him≈øelfe. Otherwi≈øe when this great worke were at an end, I would be forced for the generall care I owe to all my Subiects, to craue of France like Priuiledges to them all as Scotland alreadie enioyes, ≈øeeing the per≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall friend≈øhip remaines as great betweene vs as betweene our Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and all my Subiects mu≈øt be alike deare vnto me: which either hee will neuer grant, and ≈øo all will fall to the ground; or el≈øe it will turne to the benefite of the whole I≈øland: and ≈øo the Scotti≈øh Priuiledges cannot hold longer then my League with France la≈øteth.</p>
            <p>And for another Argument to prooue that this league is only betweene the Kings, and not betweene the people: They which haue Pen≈øions, or are priuie Intelligence giuers in France without my leaue, are in no better ca≈øe by the Law of Scotland, then if they were Pen≈øioners to Spaine.</p>
            <p>As for the Scotti≈øh Guard in France, the beginning thereof was, when an Earle of <hi>Boghan</hi> was ≈øent in aide of the French with tenne thou≈øand men, and there being made Con≈øtable, and hauing obtained a victorie,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:23110:284"/>was murthered with the mo≈øt of the Scotti≈øh Armie. In recompen≈øe whereof, and for a future ≈øecuritie to the Scotti≈øh Nation, the Scotti≈øh Guard was ordeined to haue the priuiledge and prerogatiue before all other Guards in guarding the Kings per≈øon.</p>
            <p>And as for the la≈øt point of this ≈øubdiui≈øion concerning the gaine that England may make by this Vnion, I thinke no wi≈øe nor hone≈øt man will aske any ≈øuch que≈øtion. For who is ≈øo ignorant, that doeth not know the gaine will bee great? Doe you not gaine by the Vnion of Wales? And is not Scotland greater then Wales? Shall not your Dominions bee encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed of Landes, Seas, and per≈øons added to your greatne≈ø≈øe? And are not your Landes and Seas adioyning? For who can ≈øet downe the limits of the Borders, but as a Mathematicall line or <hi>Idaea?</hi> Then will that backe doore bee ≈øhut, and tho≈øe portes of <hi>Ianus</hi> be for euer clo≈øed: you ≈øhall haue them that were your enemies to mole≈øt you, a ≈øure backe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you: their bodies ≈øhall bee your aides, and they mu≈øt bee partners in all your quarrels: Two ≈ønow-balls put together, make one the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Two hou≈øes ioyned, make one the larger: two Ca≈øtle walles made in one, makes one as thicke and ≈øtrong as both. And doe you not ≈øee in the Low countreys how auaileable the Engli≈øh and the Scotti≈øh are being ioyned together? This is a point ≈øo plaine, as no man that hath wit or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øtie, but mu≈øt acknowledge it feelingly.</p>
            <p>And where it is obiected that the Scotti≈øhmen are not tyed to the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the King in the warres aboue forty dayes; It is an ignorant mi≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. For the trewth is, That in re≈øpect the Kings of Scotland did not ≈øo abound in Trea≈øure and money to take vp an Armie vnder pay, as the Kings of England did; Therefore was the Scotti≈øh Army wont to be ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed onely by Proclamation, vpon the penaltie of their breach of alleageance; So as they were all forced to come to the Warre like Snailes who carry their hou≈øe about with them; Euery Nobleman and Gentleman bringing with him their Tents, money, proui≈øion for their hou≈øe, victuals of all ≈øorts, and all other nece≈ø≈øaries, the King ≈øupplying them of nothing: Nece≈ø≈øitie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon enforcing a warning to be giuen by the Proclamation of the ≈øpace of their attendance, without which they could not make their proui≈øion accordingly, e≈øpecially as long as they were within the bounds of Scotland, where it was not lawfull for them to helpe them≈øelues by the ≈øpoile or wa≈øting of the Countrey. But neither is there any Law Pre≈øcribing preci≈øely ≈øuch a certaine number of dayes, nor yet is it without the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Kings power to keepe them together, as many more dayes as hee li≈øt, to renew his Proclamations from time to time ≈øome rea≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable number of dayes, before the expiring of the former, they being euer bound to ≈øerue and waite vpon him, though it were an hundreth yeere if need were.</p>
            <p>Now to conclude, I am glad of this occa≈øion, that I might <hi>Liberare ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam meam;</hi> You are now to recede: when you meete againe, remember
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:23110:284"/>I pray you, the trewth and ≈øincerity of my meaning, which in ≈øeeking Vnion, is onely to aduance the greatne≈ø≈øe of your Empire ≈øeated here in England; And yet with ≈øuch caution I wi≈øh it, as may ≈øtand with the weale of both States. What is now de≈øired, hath oft before bene ≈øought when it could not bee obteined: To refu≈øe it now then, were double iniquitie. Strengthen your owne felicitie, <hi>London</hi> mu≈øt bee the Seate of your King, and Scotland ioyned to this kingdome by a Golden conque≈øt, but cymen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with loue, (as I ≈øaid before) which within will make you ≈øtrong again≈øt all Ciuill and inte≈øtine Rebellion, as without wee will bee compa≈ø≈øed and guarded with our walles of bra≈ø≈øe. Iudge mee charitably, ≈øince in this I ≈øeeke your equall good, that ≈øo both of you might bee made fearefull to your Enemies, powerfull in your ≈øelues, and auaileable to your friendes. Studie therefore hereafter to make a good Conclu≈øion, auoyd all delayes, cut off all vaine que≈øtions, that your King may haue his lawfull de≈øire, and be not di≈øgraced in his iu≈øt endes. And for your ≈øecuritie in ≈øuch rea≈øona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble points of re≈øtrictions, whereunto I am to agree, yee need neuer doubt of my inclination: For I will not ≈øay any thing which I will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe, nor promi≈øe any thing which I will not≈øweare; What I ≈øweare I will ≈øigne, and what I ≈øigne, I ≈øhall with GODS grace euer performe.</p>

            <head>A SPEACH TO THE LORDS AND COMMONS OF THE PARLIAMENT AT <hi>WHITE-HALL, ON WEDNESDAY THE</hi> XXI. OF MARCH. ANNO 1609.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E being now in the midde≈øt of this ≈øea≈øon appointed for penitence and prayer, it hath ≈øo fallen out, that the≈øe two la≈øt dayes haue bene ≈øpent in a farre other ≈øort of exerci≈øe, I meane in Euchari≈øticke Sacrifice, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation of thankes, pre≈øented vnto mee by both the parts of this body of Parliament: and therefore to make vp the number of three, (which is the number of Trinitie, and perfection) I haue thought good to make this the third Day, to be ≈øpent in this exerci≈øe.</p>
            <p>As ye made mee a faire Pre≈øent indeed in pre≈øenting your thankes and louing dueties vnto mee: So haue I now called you here, to recompence you againe with a great and a rare Pre≈øent, which is a faire and a Chri≈øtall Mirror; Not ≈øuch a Mirror wherein you may ≈øee your owne faces, or ≈øhadowes; but ≈øuch a Mirror, or Chri≈øtall, as through the tran≈øparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe thereof, you may ≈øee the heart of your King. The Philo≈øophers wi≈øh, That euery mans brea≈øt were a Chri≈øtall, where-through his heart might be ≈øeene, is vulgarly knowne, and I touched it in one of my former Speaches vnto you: But though that were impo≈ø≈øible in the generall, yet will I now performe this for my part, That as it is a trew Axiome in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:23110:286"/>That <hi>Cor Regis</hi> is <hi>in manu Domini,</hi> So wil I now ≈øet <hi>Cor Regis in oculis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli.</hi> I know that I can ≈øay nothing at this time, whereof ≈øome of you that are here, haue not at one time or other, heard me ≈øay the like already: Yet as corporall food nouri≈øheth and mainteineth the body, ≈øo doeth <hi>Remini≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> nouri≈øh and mainteine memory.</p>
            <p>I Will reduce to three generall and maine grounds, the principall things that haue bene agitated in this Parliament, and whereof I will now ≈øpeake.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, the Arrand for which you were called by me; And that was, for ≈øupporting of my ≈øtate, and nece≈ø≈øities.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond is, that which the people are to mooue vnto the King: To repre≈øent vnto him ≈øuch things, whereby the Subiects are vexed, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ≈øtate of the Common wealth is to be redre≈ø≈øed: And that is the thing which you call grieuances.</p>
            <p>The third ground that hath bene handled among≈øt you, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in talke among≈øt you in the Parliament, but euen in many other peoples mouthes, a≈øwell within, as without the Parliament, is of a higher nature then any of the former (though it be but an Incident?) and the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe it concernes a higher point; And this is a doubt, which hath bene in the heads of ≈øome, of my Intention in two things.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, whether I was re≈øolued in the generall, to continue ≈øtill my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment according to the ancient forme of this State, and the Lawes of this Kingdome: Or if I had an intention not to limit my ≈øelfe within tho≈øe bounds, but to alter the ≈øame when I thought conuenient, by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute power of a King.</p>
            <p>The other branch is anent the Common Law, which ≈øome had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit I di≈øliked, and (in re≈øpect that I was borne where another forme of Law was e≈øtabli≈øhed) that I would haue wi≈øhed the Ciuill Law to haue bene put in place of the Common Law for gouernment of this people. And the complaint made among≈øt you of a booke written by doctour <hi>Cowell,</hi> was a part of the occa≈øion of this incident: But as touching my cen≈øure of that booke, I made it already to bee deliuered vnto you by the Trea≈øurer here ≈øitting, which he did out of my owne directions and notes; and what he ≈øaid in my name, that had he directly from me: But what hee ≈øpake of him≈øelfe therein without my direction, I ≈øhal alwayes make good; for you may be ≈øure I will be loth to make ≈øo hone≈øt a man a lyer, or deceiue your expectations: alwayes within very few dayes my Edict ≈øhall come forth anent that matter, which ≈øhall fully di≈øcouer my meaning.</p>
            <p>There was neuer any rea≈øon to mooue men to thinke, that I could like of ≈øuch grounds: For there are two qualities principally, or rather priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that make Kings ≈øubiect to flatterie; <hi>Credulitie</hi> and <hi>Ignorance;</hi> and I hope none of them can bee iu≈øtly obiected to mee: For if <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, for all his learning, had bene wi≈øe in that point to haue con≈øidered the
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:23110:286"/>≈øtate of his owne naturall body and di≈øpo≈øition, hee would neuer haue thought him ≈øelfe a god. And now to the matter. As it is a Chri≈øtan duety in euery man, <hi>Reddere rationem fidei,</hi> and not to be a≈øhamed to giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his profe≈ø≈øion before men, and Angels, as oft as occa≈øion ≈øhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: So did I euer hold it a nece≈ø≈øitie of honour in a iu≈øt and wi≈øe King, though not to giue an account to his people of his actions, yet clearely to deliuer his heart and intention vnto them vpon euery occa≈øion. But I mu≈øt inuert my order, and begin fir≈øt with that incident which was la≈øt in my diui≈øion (though highe≈øt of nature) and ≈øo goe backward.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He State of MONARCHIE is the ≈øupreme≈øt thing vpon earth: For Kings are not onely GODS Lieutenants vpon earth, and ≈øit vpon GODS throne, but euen by GOD him≈øelfe they are called Gods. There bee three principall ≈øimilitudes that illu≈øtrate the ≈øtate of MONARCHIE: One taken out of the word of GOD; and the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the grounds of Policie and Philo≈øophie. In the Scriptures Kings are called Gods, and ≈øo their power after a certaine relation compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Diuine power. Kings are al≈øo compared to Fathers of families: for a King is trewly <hi>Parens patriae,</hi> the politique father of his people. And la≈øtly, Kings are compared to the head of this Microco≈øme of the body of man.</p>
            <p>Kings are iu≈øtly called Gods, for that they exerci≈øe a manner or re≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Diuine power vpon earth: For if you wil con≈øider the Attributes to God, you ≈øhall ≈øee how they agree in the per≈øon of a King. God hath power to create, or de≈øtroy, make, or vnmake at his plea≈øure, to giue life, or ≈øend death, to iudge all, and to bee iudged nor accomptable to none: To rai≈øe low things, and to make high things low at his plea≈øure, and to God are both ≈øoule and body due. And the like power haue Kings: they make and vnmake their ≈øubiects: they haue power of rai≈øing, and ca≈øting downe: of life, and of death: Iudges ouer all their ≈øubiects, and in all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, and yet accomptable to none but God onely. They haue power to exalt low things, and aba≈øe high things, and make of their ≈øubiects like men at the Che≈ø≈øe; A pawne to take a Bi≈øhop or a Knight, and to cry vp, or downe any of their ≈øubiects, as they do their money. And to the King is due both the affection of the ≈øoule, and the ≈øeruice of the body of his ≈øubiects: And therefore that reuerend Bi≈øhop here among≈øt you, though I heare that by diuers he was mi≈øtaken or not wel vnder≈øtood, yet did he preach both lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly and trewly annent this point concerning the power of a King: For what he ≈øpake of a Kings power in <hi>Ab≈øtracto,</hi> is mo≈øt trew in Diuinitie: For to Emperors, or Kings that are Monarches, their Subiects bodies &amp; goods are due for their defence and maintenance. But if I had bene in his place, I would only haue added two words, which would haue cleared all: For after I had told as a Diuine, what was due by the Subiects to their Kings in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, I would then haue concluded as an Engli≈øhman, ≈øhewing this people,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:23110:287"/>That as in generall all Subiects were bound to relieue their King; So to exhort them, that as wee liued in a ≈øetled ≈øtate of a Kingdome which was gouerned by his owne fundamentall Lawes and Orders, that according thereunto, they were now (being a≈ø≈øembled for this purpo≈øe in Parliament) to con≈øider how to helpe ≈øuch a King as now they had; And that according to the ancient forme, and order e≈øtabli≈øhed in this Kingdome: putting ≈øo, a difference betweene the generall power of a King in Diuinity, and the ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and e≈øtabli≈øhed State of this Crowne, and Kingdome. And I am ≈øure that the Bi≈øhop meant to haue done the ≈øame, if hee had not bene ≈øtraited by time, which in re≈øpect of the greatne≈ø≈øe of the pre≈øence preaching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and ≈øuch an Auditory, he dur≈øt not pre≈øume vpon.</p>
            <p>As for the Father of a familie, they had of olde vnder the Law of Nature <hi>Patriam pote≈øtatem,</hi> which was <hi>Pote≈øtatem vitae &amp; necis,</hi> ouer their children or familie, (I meane ≈øuch Fathers of families as were the lineall heires of tho≈øe families whereof Kings did originally come:) For Kings had their fir≈øt originall from them, who planted and ≈øpread them≈øelues in <hi>Colonies</hi> through the world. Now a Father may di≈øpo≈øe of his Inheritance to his children, at his plea≈øure: yea, euen di≈øinherite the elde≈øt vpon iu≈øt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, and preferre the younge≈øt, according to his liking; make them beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or rich at his plea≈øure; re≈øtraine, or bani≈øh out of his pre≈øence, as hee findes them giue cau≈øe of offence, or re≈øtore them in fauour againe with the penitent ≈øinner: So may the King deale with his Subiects.</p>
            <p>And la≈øtly, as for the head of the naturall body, the head hath the power of directing all the members of the body to that v≈øe which the iudgement in the head thinkes mo≈øt conuenient. It may apply ≈øharpe cures, or cut off corrupt members, let blood in what proportion it thinkes fit, and as the body may ≈øpare, but yet is all this power ordeined by God <hi>Ad aedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationem, non ad de≈øtructionem.</hi> For although God haue power a≈øwell of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction, as of creation or maintenance; yet will it not agree with the wi≈øedome of God, to exerci≈øe his power in the de≈øtruction of nature, and ouerturning the whole frame of things, ≈øince his creatures were made, that his glory might thereby be the better expre≈ø≈øed: So were hee a fooli≈øh fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that would di≈øinherite or de≈øtroy his children without a cau≈øe, or leaue off the carefull education of them; And it were an idle head that would in place of phi≈øicke ≈øo poy≈øon or phlebotomize the body as might breede a dangerous di≈øtemper or de≈øtruction thereof.</p>
            <p>But now in the≈øe our times we are to di≈øtingui≈øh betweene the ≈øtate of Kings in their fir≈øt originall, and betweene the ≈øtate of ≈øetled Kings and Monarches, that doe at this time gouerne in ciuill Kingdomes: For euen as God, during the time of the olde Te≈øtament, ≈øpake by Oracles, and wrought by Miracles; yet how ≈øoone it plea≈øed him to ≈øetle a <hi>Church</hi> which was bought, and redeemed by the blood of his onely Sonne <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> then was there a ce≈ø≈øation of both; Hee euer after gouerning his people and Church within the limits of his reueiledwill. So in the fir≈øt originall of
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:23110:287"/>Kings, whereof ≈øome had their beginning by Conque≈øt, and ≈øome by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people, their wills at that time ≈øerued for Law; Yet how ≈øoone Kingdomes began to be ≈øetled in ciuilitie and policie, then did Kings ≈øet downe their minds by Lawes, which are properly made by the King one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but at the rogation of the people, the Kings grant being obteined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And ≈øo the King became to be <hi>Lex loquens,</hi> after a ≈øort, binding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe by a double oath to the ob≈øeruation of the fundamentall Lawes of his kingdome: <hi>Tacitly,</hi> as by being a King, and ≈øo bound to protect a≈øwell the people, as the Lawes of his Kingdome; And <hi>Expre≈øly,</hi> by his oath at his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation: So as euery iu≈øt King in a ≈øetled Kingdome is bound to ob≈øerue that paction made to his people by his Lawes, in framing his gouernment agreeable thereunto, according to that paction which God made with <hi>Noe</hi> after the deluge, <hi>Hereafter Seed-time, and Harue≈øt, Cold and Heate, Summer and Winter, and Day and Night ≈øhall not cea≈øe, ≈øo long as the earth remaines.</hi> And therefore a King gouerning in a ≈øetled Kingdome, leaues to be a King, and degenerates into a Tyrant, a≈ø≈øoone as he leaues off to rule according to his Lawes. In which ca≈øe the Kings con≈øcience may ≈øpeake vnto him, as the poore widow ≈øaid to Philip of Macedon; Either gouerne according to your Law, <hi>Aut ne Rex≈øis.</hi> And though no Chri≈øtian man ought to allow any rebellion of people again≈øt their Prince, yet doeth God neuer leaue Kings vnpuni≈øhed when they tran≈øgre≈ø≈øe the≈øe limits: For in that ≈øame P≈øalme where God ≈øaith to Kings, <hi>Vos Dij e≈øtis,</hi> hee immediatly thereafter concludes, <hi>But ye ≈øhall die like men.</hi> The higher wee are placed, the greater ≈øhall our fall be. <hi>Vt ca≈øus ≈øic dolor:</hi> the taller the trees be, the more in danger of the winde; and the tempe≈øt beats ≈øore≈øt vpon the highe≈øt mountaines. Therefore all Kings that are not tyrants, or periured, wil be glad to bound them≈øelues within the limits of their Lawes; and they that per≈øwade them the contrary, are vipers, and pe≈øts, both again≈øt them and the Common-wealth. For it is a great difference betweene a Kings gouernment in a ≈øetled State, and what Kings in their originall power might doe in <hi>Indiuiduo vago.</hi> As for my part, I thanke God, I haue euer giuen good proofe, that I neuer had intention to the contrary: And I am ≈øure to goe to my graue with that reputation and comfort, that neuer King was in all his time more carefull to haue his Lawes duely ob≈øerued, and him≈øelfe to gouerne thereafter, then I.</p>
            <p>I conclude then this point touching the power of Kings, with this Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome of Diuinitie, That as to di≈øpute what God may doe, is Bla≈øphemie; but <hi>quid vult Deus,</hi> that Diuines may lawfully, and doe ordinarily di≈øpute and di≈øcu≈ø≈øe; for to di≈øpute <hi>A Po≈ø≈øe ad E≈ø≈øe</hi> is both again≈øt Logicke and Diuinitie: So is it ≈øedition in Subiects, to di≈øpute what a King may do in the height of his power: But iu≈øt Kings wil euer be willing to declare what they wil do, if they wil not incurre the cur≈øe of God. I wil not be content that my power be di≈øputed vpon: but I ≈øhall euer be willing to make the rea≈øon appeare of all my doings, and rule my actions according to my Lawes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="532" facs="tcp:23110:288"/>The other branch of this incident is concerning the Common Law, being conceiued by ≈øome, that I contemned it, and preferred the Ciuil Law thereunto. As I haue already ≈øaid, Kings Actions (euen in the ≈øecrete≈øt places) are as the actions of tho≈øe that are ≈øet vpon the Stages, or on the tops of hou≈øes: and I hope neuer to ≈øpeake that in priuate, which I ≈øhall not auow in publique, and Print it if need be, (as I ≈øaid in my BASILICON DORON.) For it is trew, that within the≈øe few dayes I ≈øpake freely my minde touching the Common Law in my Priuie Chamber, at the time of my dinner, which is come to all your eares; and the ≈øame was likewi≈øe related vnto you by my Trea≈øurer, and now I will againe repeate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ≈øame my ≈øelfe vnto you. Fir≈øt, as a King I haue lea≈øt cau≈øe of any man to di≈ølike the Common Law: For no Law can bee more fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and aduantagious for a King, and extendeth further his Prerogatiue, then it doeth: And for a King of England to de≈øpile the Common Law, it is to neglect his owne Crowne. It is trew, that I doe greatly e≈øteeme the Ciuill Law, the profe≈ø≈øion thereof ≈øeruing more for generall learning and being mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary for matters of Treatie with all forreine Nations: And I thinke that if it ≈øhould bee taken away, it would make an entrie to Barbari≈øme in this Kingdome, and would blemi≈øh the honour of England: For it is in a maner LEX GENTIVM, and maintaineth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercour≈øe with all forreme Nations: but I onely allow it to haue cour≈øe here, according to tho≈øe limits of Iuri≈ødiction, which the Common Law it ≈øelfe doeth allow it: And therefore though it bee not fit for the generall gouernment of the people here; it doeth not follow, it ≈øhould be extinct, no more, then becau≈øe the Latine tongue is not the Mother or Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Language of any Nation in the world at this time, that therefore the Engli≈øh tongue ≈øhould onely now be learned in this Kingdome, which were to bring in Barbari≈øme. My meaning therefore is not, to preferre the Ciuill Law before the Common Law; but onely that it ≈øhould not be extingui≈øhed, and yet ≈øo bounded, (I meane to ≈øuch Courts and Cau≈øes) as haue beene in ancient v≈øe; As the Eccle≈øia≈øticall Courts, Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miraltie, Court of Reque≈øts, and ≈øuch like, re≈øeruing euer to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law to meddle with the fundamentall Lawes of this Kingdome, either concerning the Kings Prerogatiue, or the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions of Subiects, in any que≈øtions, either betweene the King, and any of them, or among≈øt them≈øelues, in the points of <hi>Meum &amp; tuum.</hi> For it is trew, that there is no Kingdome in the world, not onely Scotland, but not France, nor Spaine, nor any other Kingdome gouerned meerely by the Ciuill Law, but euery one of them hath their owne municipall Lawes agreeable to their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtomes, as this Kingdome hath the Common Law: Nay, I am ≈øo farre from di≈øallowing the Common Law, as I prote≈øt, that if it were in my hand to chu≈øe a new Law for this Kingdome, I would not onely preferre it before any other Nationall Law, but euen before the very Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Law of <hi>Moy≈øes:</hi> and yet I ≈øpeake no bla≈øphemie in preferring it for
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:23110:288"/>conueniencie to this Kingdome, and at this time, to the very Law of God: For God gouerned his ≈øelected people by the≈øe three Lawes, <hi>Ceremoniall, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> and <hi>Iudiciall:</hi> The <hi>Iudiciall,</hi> being onely fit for a certaine people, and a certaine time, which could not ≈øerue for the general of all other people and times. As for example, If the Law of hanging for Theft, were turned here to re≈øtitution of treble or quadruple, as it was in the Law of <hi>Moy≈øes,</hi> what would become of all the middle Shires, and all the Iri≈øhrie and Highlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? But the maine point is, That if the fundamentall Lawes of any Kingdome ≈øhould be altered, who ≈øhould di≈øcerne what is <hi>Meum &amp; tuum,</hi> or how ≈øhould a King gouerne? It would be like the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Calender, which de≈øtroyes the old, and yet doeth this new trouble all the debts and Accompts of Traffiques and Merchandizes: Nay by that accompt I can neuer tell mine owne aage; for now is my Birth-day remooued by the ≈øpace often dayes neerer me then it was before the change. But vpon the other part, though I haue in one point preferred our Common Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our v≈øe to the very Law of GOD; yet in another re≈øpect I mu≈øt ≈øay, both our Law and all Lawes el≈øe are farre inferiour to that Iudiciall Law of GOD; for no booke nor Law is perfect nor free from corruption, except onely the booke and Law of GOD. And therefore I could wi≈øh ≈øome three things ≈øpecially to be purged &amp; cleared in the Common Law; but alwayes by the adui≈øe of Parliament: For the King with his Parliament here are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute, (as I vnder≈øtand) in making or forming of any ≈øort of Lawes.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt I could wi≈øh that it were written in our vulgar Language: for now it is in an old, mixt, and corrupt Language, onely vnder≈øtood by Lawyers: whereas euery Subiect ought to vnder≈øtand the Law vnder which he liues: For ≈øince it is our plea again≈øt the Papi≈øts, that the language in GODS Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice ought not to be in an vnknowne tongue, according to the rule in the Law of <hi>Moy≈øes,</hi> That the Law ≈øhould be written in the fringes of the Prie≈øts garment, and ≈øhould be publikely read in the eares of all the people: ≈øo mee thinkes ought our Law to be made as plaine as can be to the people, that the excu≈øe of ignorance may be taken from them, for conforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues thereunto.</p>
            <p>Next, our Common Law hath not a ≈øetled Text in all Ca≈øes, being chiefly grounded either vpon old Cu≈øtomes, or el≈øe vpon the Reports and Ca≈øes of Iudges, which ye call <hi>Respon≈øa Prudentum.</hi> The like whereof is in all other Lawes: for they are much ruled by Pre≈øidents (≈øaue onely in <hi>Denmarke</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> where the letter of the Law re≈øolues all doubts without any trouble to the Iudge,) But though it be trew, that no Text of Law can be ≈øo certaine, wherein the circum≈øtances will not make a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation in the Ca≈øe, (for in this aage, mens wits increa≈øe ≈øo much by ciuilitie, that the circum≈øtances of euery particular ca≈øe varies ≈øo much from the generall Text of Law, as in the Ciuill Law it ≈øelfe, there are therefore ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Doctors that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ment vpon the Text, &amp; neuer a one almo≈øt agrees with another; Otherwi≈øe there needed no Iudges, but the bare letter of the
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:23110:289"/>Law.) Yet could I wi≈øh that ≈øome more certaintie were ≈øet downe in this ca≈øe by Parliament: for ≈øince the very Reports them≈øelues are not alwayes ≈øo binding, but that diuers times Iudges doe di≈øclaime them, and recede from the iudgment of their predece≈ø≈øors; it were good, that vpon a mature deliberation, the expo≈øition of the Law were ≈øet downe by Acte of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ≈øuch reports therein confirmed, as were thought fit to ≈øerue for Law in all times hereafter, and ≈øo the people ≈øhould not depend vpon the bare opinions of Iudges, and vncertaine Reports.</p>
            <p>And la≈øtly, there be in the Common Law diuers contrary Reports, and Pre≈øidents: and this corruption doeth likewi≈øe concerne the Statutes and Acts of Parliament, in re≈øpect there are diuers cro≈ø≈øe and cuffing Statutes, and ≈øome ≈øo penned, as they may be taken in diuers, yea contrary ≈øences. And therefore would I wi≈øh both tho≈øe Statutes and Reports, a≈øwell in the Parliament as Common Law, to be once maturely reuiewed, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled; And that not onely all contrarieties ≈øhould be ≈øcraped out of our Bookes, but euen that ≈øuch penall Statutes as were made, but for the v≈øe of the time (from breach whereof no man can be free) which doe not now agree with the condition of this our time, might likewi≈øe beleft out of our bookes, which vnder a tyrannous or auaritious King could not be endured. And this reformation might (me thinkes) bee made a worthy worke, and well de≈øerues a Parliament to be ≈øet of purpo≈øe for it.</p>
            <p>I know now that being vpon this point of the Common Law, you looke to heare my opinion concerning <hi>Prohibitions;</hi> and I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that I haue bene thought to be an enemie to all <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> and an vtter ≈øtayer of them: But I will ≈øhortly now informe you what hath bene my cour≈øe in proceeding therein. It is trew that in re≈øpect of diuers hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Courts, and Iuri≈ødictions planted in this Kingdome, I haue often wi≈øhed that euery Court had his owne trew limit, and iuri≈ødiction clearely ≈øet downe, and certainly knowne; which if it be exceeded by any of them, or that any of them encroch one vpon another, then I grant that a <hi>Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi> in that ca≈øe is to goe out of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> but chieflie≈øt out of the <hi>Chancery;</hi> for other Benches I am not yet ≈øo well re≈øolued of their Iuri≈ødicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that point. And for my part, I was neuer again≈øt <hi>Prohibitions</hi> of this nature, nor the trew v≈øe of them, which is indeed to keepe euery Riuer within his owne banks and channels. But when I ≈øaw the ≈øwelling and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflowing of <hi>Prohibitions</hi> in a farre greater abundance then euer before, euery Court ≈øtriuing to bring in mo≈øt moulture to their owne Mill, by multitudes of Cau≈øes, which is a di≈øea≈øe very naturall to all Courts and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈ødictions in the world; Then dealt I with this Cau≈øe, and that at two ≈øeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times, once in the midde≈øt of Winter, and againe in the midde≈øt of the next following Summer; At euery of which times I ≈øpent three whole daies in that labour. And then after a large hearing, I told them as <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> ≈øaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Mariage, <hi>Ab initio non fuit ≈øic.</hi> For as God conteins the Sea within his owne bounds and marches (as it is in the <hi>P≈øalmes,</hi>) So is it my office to make
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:23110:289"/>euery Court conteine him≈øelfe within his own limits; And therfore I gaue admonitions to both ≈øides: To the other Courts, that they ≈øhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hereafter euery of them, to conteine them≈øelues within the bounds of their owne Iuri≈ødictions; and to the Courts of Common Law, that they ≈øhould not bee ≈øo forward, and prodigall in multiplying their <hi>Prohibitions.</hi> Two cautions I willed them to ob≈øerue in graunting their <hi>Prohibitions:</hi> Fir≈øt, that they ≈øhould be graunted in a right and lawfull forme: And next, that they ≈øhould not grant them, but vpon a iu≈øt and rea≈øonable cau≈øe. As to the forme, it was, That none ≈øhould be graunted by any one particular Iudge, or in time of Vacation, or in any other place, but openly in Court. And to this the Iudges them≈øelues gaue their willing a≈ø≈øent. And as to the Cau≈øe, That they ≈øhould not be granted vpon euery ≈øleight furmi≈øe, or information of the partie, but alwayes that a due and graue examination ≈øhould fir≈øt precede. Otherwi≈øe if <hi>Prohibitions</hi> ≈øhould ra≈øhly, and headily be granted, then no man is the more ≈øecure of his owne, though hee hath gotten a Sentence with him: For as good haue no Law, or Sentence, as to haue no execution thereof. A poore Mini≈øter with much labour and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øe, hauing exhau≈øted his poore meanes, and being forced to forbeare his ≈øtudie, and to become <hi>non re≈øident</hi> from his flocke, obtaines a <hi>Sentence,</hi> and then when hee loookes to enioy the fruits thereof, he is defrauded of all by a <hi>Prohibition,</hi> according to the parable of Chri≈øt, That night when hee thinkes him≈øelfe mo≈øt happy, ≈øhall his ≈øoule be taken from him: And ≈øo is he tortured like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> who when he hath the Apple at his mouth, and that he is gaping and opening his mouth to receiue it, then mu≈øt it be pulled from him by a <hi>Prohibition,</hi> and he not ≈øuffered to ta≈øte thereof. So as to conclude this point, I put a difference betweene the trew v≈øe of <hi>Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and the ≈øuperabounding abu≈øe thereof: for as a thing which is good, ought not therefore bee abu≈øed; ≈øo ought not the lawfull v≈øe of a good thing be forborne, becau≈øe of the abu≈øe thereof.</p>

But though my Speech was before directed to the whole Body of Parliament; yet in this ca≈øe I mu≈øt addre≈ø≈øe my Speech in ≈øpeciall to you of the Lower Hou≈øe.</p>
            <p>I am now then to recommend vnto your con≈øiderations the matter and manner of your handling and pre≈øenting of <hi>Grieuances.</hi> As for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, though I will not denie, but that yee, repre≈øenting the Body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

In this, I ≈øay, you ≈øhewed your care and ielou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie of my Honour, and I ≈øent you thankes for it by the Chancellour of the Exchequer, a member of your owne Hou≈øe, who by your appointment, that ≈øame night acquainted me with your proceedings; And by him al≈øo I promi≈øed at that time, that you ≈øhould heare more of my thankes for the ≈øame at the fir≈øt occa≈øion; And now I tell you it my ≈øelfe, that you may know how kindely I take your duetifull behauiour in this ca≈øe. But ≈øince this was a good effect of an euill cau≈øe, I mu≈øt not omit al≈øo to admoni≈øh you vpon the other part, to take a cour≈øe among≈øt your ≈øelues, to preuent the like accident in all times hereafter: otherwi≈øe the Lower hou≈øe may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a place for <hi>Pa≈øquils,</hi> and at another time ≈øuch <hi>Grieuances</hi> may be ca≈øt in among≈øt you, as may conteine Trea≈øon or ≈øcandal again≈øt Me, or my Po≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

            <p>
               <pb n="537" facs="tcp:23110:290"/>Fir≈øt then, I am not to finde fault that you informe your ≈øelues of the particular iu≈øt <hi>Grieuances</hi> of the people; Nay, I mu≈øt tell you, ye can neither be iu≈øt nor faithfull to me, or to your Countreys that tru≈øt and imploy you, if you doe it not: For true Plaints proceede not from the per≈øons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, but from the Body repre≈øented, which is the people.

            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, that you doe not meddle with the maine points of Gouernment; that is my craft: <hi>tractent fabrilia ≈øabri;</hi> to meddle with that, were to le≈ø≈øon me: I am now an old King; for ≈øixe and thirtie yeeres haue I gouerned in <hi>Scotland</hi> per≈øonally, and now haue I accompli≈øhed my app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, I would not haue you meddle with ≈øuch ancient Rights of mine, as I haue receiued from my Predece≈ø≈øors, po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing them, <hi>More Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iorum:</hi> ≈øuch things I would bee ≈øorie ≈øhould bee accounted for <hi>Grieuances.</hi> All nouelties are dangerous as well in a politique as in a naturall Body: And therefore I would be loth to be quarrelled in my ancient Rights and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions: for that were to iudge mee vnworthy of that which my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dece≈ø≈øors had, and left me.</p>
            <p>And la≈øtly, I pray you beware to exhibite for <hi>Grieuance</hi> any thing that is e≈øtabli≈øhed by a ≈øetled Law, and whereunto (as you haue already had a proofe) you know I will neuer giue a plau≈øible an≈øwere: For it is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifull part in Subiects to pre≈ø≈øe their King, wherein they know before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand he will refu≈øe them. Now, if any Law or Statute be not conuenient, let it be amended by Parliament, but in the meane time terme it not a <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance:</hi> for to be grieued with the Law, is to be grieued with the King, who is ≈øworne to bee the Patron and mainteiner thereof. But as all men are fle≈øh, and may erre in the execution of Lawes; So may ye iu≈øtly make a <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance</hi> of any abu≈øe of the Law, di≈øtingui≈øhing wi≈øely betweene the faults of the per≈øon, and the thing it ≈øelfe. As for example, Complaints may be made vnto you of the high Commi≈ø≈øioners: If ≈øo be, trie the abu≈øe, and ≈øpare not to complaine vpon it, but ≈øay not there ≈øhall be no Commi≈ø≈øion, For that were to abridge the power that is in me: and I will plainely tell you.

               </gap> ≈øo high a nature, from which there is no appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to any other Court, I haue thought good to re≈øtraine it onely to the two Archbi≈øhops, where before it was common among≈øt a great part of the Bi≈øhops in England. This Law I haue ≈øet to my ≈øelfe, and therefore you
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:23110:291"/>may be a≈ø≈øured, that I will neuer finde fault with any man, nor thinke him the more Puritane, that will complaine to me out of Parliament, a≈øwell as in Parliament, of any error in execution thereof, ≈øo that hee prooue it; Otherwi≈øe it were but a calumnie. Onely I would bee loath that any man ≈øhould grieue at the Commi≈ø≈øion it ≈øelfe, as I haue already ≈øaid. Yee haue heard (I am ≈øure) of the paines I tooke both in the cau≈øes of the Admiralty, and of the Prohibitions: If any man therefore will bring me any iu≈øt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints vpon any matters of ≈øo high a nature as this is, yee may a≈ø≈øure your ≈øelues that I will not ≈øpare my labour in hearing it. In faith you neuer had a more painefull King, or that will be readier in his per≈øon to determine cau≈øes that are fit for his hearing. And when euer any of you ≈øhall make experience of me in this point, ye may be ≈øure neuer to want acce≈ø≈øe, nor ye ≈øhall neuer come wrong to me, in, or out of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude this purpo≈øe of <hi>Grieuances,</hi> I haue one generall <hi>grieuance</hi> to commend vnto you, and that in the behalfe of the Countreys from whence ye come. And this is, to pray you to beware that your <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances</hi> ≈øauour not of particular mens thoughts, but of the generall griefes ri≈øing out of the mindes of the people, and not out of the humor of the propounder. And therefore I would wi≈øh you to take heede carefully, and con≈øider of the partie that propounds the <hi>grieuance:</hi> for ye may (if ye li≈øt) ea≈øily di≈øcerne whether it bee his owne pa≈ø≈øion, or the peoples griefe, that makes him to ≈øpeake: for many a man will in your hou≈øe propound a <hi>Grieuance</hi> out of his owne humour, becau≈øe (peraduenture) he accounts highly of that matter: and yet the countrey that imployes him, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps either be of a contrary minde, or (at lea≈øt) little care for it. As for example, I a≈ø≈øure you, I can very well ≈ømell betweene a Petition that mooues from a generall <hi>Grieuance,</hi> or ≈øuch a one as comes from the ≈øpleene of ≈øome particular per≈øon, either again≈øt Eccle≈øia≈øticall gouernment in generall, or the per≈øon of any one Noble man, or Commi≈ø≈øioner in particular.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd now the third point remaines to bee ≈øpoken of; which is the cau≈øe of my calling of this Parliament. And in this I haue done but as I v≈øe to doe in all my life, which is to leaue mine owne errand hindmo≈øt.</p>
            <p>It may bee you did wonder that I did not ≈øpeake vnto you publikely at the beginning of this Se≈ø≈øion of Parliament, to tell you the cau≈øe of your calling, as I did (if I bee rightly remembred) in euery Se≈ø≈øion before. But the trewth is, that becau≈øe I call you at this time for my particular Errand, I thought it fitter to bee opened vnto you by my Trea≈øurer, who is my publike and mo≈øt principall Officer in matters of that nature, then that I ≈øhould doe it my ≈øelfe: for I confe≈ø≈øe I am le≈ø≈øe naturally eloquent, and haue greater cau≈øe to di≈øtru≈øt mine elocution in matters of this nature, then in any other thing.

Duetie I may iu≈øtly claime of you as my Subiects; and one of the branches of duetie which Subiects owe to their Soueraigne, is Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: but in what quantitie, and at what time, that mu≈øt come of your loues. I am not now therefore to di≈øpute of a Kings power, but to tell you what I may iu≈øtly craue, and expect with your good wills. I was euer again≈øt all extremes; and in this ca≈øe I will likewi≈øe wi≈øh you to auoyd them on both ≈øides. For if you faile in the one, I might haue great cau≈øe to blame you as Parliament men, being called by me for my Errands: And if you fall into the other extreme, by ≈øupply of my nece≈ø≈øities without re≈øpectiue care to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd oppre≈ø≈øion or partialitie in the Leuie, both I and the Countrey will haue cau≈øe to blame you.</p>
            <p>When I thinke vpon the compo≈øition of this body of Parliament, I doe well con≈øider that the Vpper hou≈øe is compo≈øed of the Seculer Nobilitie, who are hereditary Lords of Parliament; and of Bi≈øhops, that are liue Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Barons of the ≈øame: And therefore what is giuen by the Vpper hou≈øe, is giuen onely from the trew body of that Hou≈øe; and out of their owne purpo≈øes that doe giue it; whereas the Lower hou≈øe is but the repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue body of the Commons, and ≈øo what you giue, you giue it a≈øwell for others, as for your ≈øelues: and therefore you haue the more rea≈øon to e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew both the extreames. On the one part, ye may the more ea≈øily be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, ≈øince it comes not all from your ≈øelues; and yet vpon the other part, if yee giue more then is fit for good and louing Subiects to yeeld vpon ≈øuch nece≈ø≈øary occa≈øions, yee abu≈øe the King, and hurt the people; And ≈øuch a gift I will neuer accept: For in ≈øuch a ca≈øe you might deceiue a King, in giuing your flattering con≈øent to that which you know might moue the people generally to grudge and murmure at it, and ≈øo ≈øhould the King find him≈øelfe deceiued in his <hi>Caloule,</hi> and the people likewi≈øe grieued in their hearts; the loue and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of which (I prote≈øt) I did, and euer will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt the greate≈øt earthly ≈øecuritie (next the fauour of GOD) to any wi≈øe or iu≈øt King. For though it was vainely ≈øaide by one of your Hou≈øe, That yee had need to beware, that by giuing mee too much, your throats were not in danger of cutting at your comming home: yet may ye a≈ø≈øure your ≈øelues, that I will euer bee lothe to pre≈ø≈øe you to doe that which may wrong the people, and make you iu≈øtly to beare the blame thereof. But that yee may the better bee acquainted with my inclination, I will appeale to a number of my Priuie Councell here pre≈øent, if that before the calling of this Parliament, and when I found that the nece≈ø≈øitie of my e≈øtate required ≈øo great a ≈øupply, they found me more de≈øirous to obtaine
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:23110:292"/>that which I was forced to ≈øeeke, then carefull that the people might yeeld me a ≈øupply in ≈øo great a mea≈øure as my nece≈ø≈øities required, without their too great lo≈ø≈øe. And you all that are Parliament men, and here pre≈øent of both Hou≈øes can beare me witne≈ø≈øe, if euer I burthened or imployed any of you for any particular Sub≈øidies, or ≈øummes by name, further then my laying open the particular nece≈ø≈øities of my ≈øtate, or yet if euer I ≈øpake to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Priuie Councellour, or any of my learned Councell, to labour voyces for me to this end; I euer dete≈øted the hunting for <hi>Emendicata Suffragia.</hi> A King that will rule and gouerne iu≈øtly, mu≈øt haue regard to Con≈øcience, Honour and Iudgement, in all his great Actions, (as your ≈øelfe M. Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker remembred the other day.) And therefore ye may a≈ø≈øure your ≈øelues, That I euer limitall my great Actions within that compa≈ø≈øe. But as vpon the one ≈øide, I doe not de≈øire you ≈øhould yeeld to that extreame, in giuing me more then (as I ≈øaid formerly) vpon ≈øuch nece≈ø≈øary occa≈øions are fit for good and louing Subiects to yeeld; For that were to giue me a pur≈øe with a knife: So on the other ≈øide, I hope you will not make vaine pretences of wants, out of cau≈øele≈ø≈øe apprehen≈øions, or idle excu≈øes, neither cloake your owne humours (when your ≈øelues are vnwilling) by alledging the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie of the people. For although I will be no le≈ø≈øe iu≈øt, as a King, to ≈øuch per≈øons, then any other: (For my Iu≈øtice with Gods grace, ≈øhalbe alike o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to all) yet ye mu≈øt thinke I haue no rea≈øon to thanke them, or gratifie them with any ≈øuits or matters of grace, when their errand ≈øhall come in my way; And yet no man can ≈øay, that euer I quarrelled any man for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øing mee a Sub≈øidie, if hee did it in a moderate fa≈øhion, and with good rea≈øons. For him that denies a good Law, I will not ≈øpare to quarrell: But for graunting or denying money, it is but an effect of loue: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the point of my nece≈ø≈øities, I onely de≈øire that I be not refu≈øed in that which of duety I ought to haue: For I know if it were propounded in the generall among≈øt you, whether the Kings wants ought to be relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or not, there is not one of you, that would make que≈øtion of it. And though in a ≈øort this may ≈øeeme to be my particular; yet it can not bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided from the generall good of the Common wealth; For the King that is <hi>Parens Patriae,</hi> telles you of his wants. Nay, <hi>Patria ip≈øa</hi> by him ≈øpeakes vnto you. For if the King want, the State wants, and therefore the ≈øtrengthening of the King is the pre≈øeruation and the ≈øtanding of the State; And woe be to him that diuides the weale of the King from the weale of the Kingdome. And as that King is mi≈øerable (how rich ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he bee) that raines ouer a poore people, (for the hearts and riches of the people, are the Kings greate≈øt trea≈øure;) So is that Kingdome not able to ≈øub≈øi≈øt, how rich and potent ≈øoeuer the people be, if their King wants meanes to mainaine his State: for the meanes of your King are the ≈øinewes of the kingdome both in warre and peace: for in peace I mu≈øt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter iu≈øtice vnto you, and in warre I mu≈øt defend you by Armes: but neither of the≈øe can I do without ≈øufficient means, which mu≈øt come from
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:23110:292"/>your Aide and Supply. I confe≈ø≈øe it is farre again≈øt my nature to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then≈øome to my people: for it cannot but grieue me to craue of others, that was borne to be begged of. It is trew, I craue more then euer King of England did; but I haue farre greater and iu≈øter cau≈øe and rea≈øon to craue, then euer King of England had. And though my Trea≈øurer hath at length declared the rea≈øons vnto you of my nece≈ø≈øities, and of a large ≈øupply that he craued for the ≈øame, wherein he omitted no arguments that can be v≈øed for that purpo≈øe; yet will I my ≈øelfe now ≈øhortly remember you ≈øome of the weightie≈øt rea≈øons that come in my head, to proue the equitie of my demaund.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, ye all know, that by the acce≈ø≈øion of more Crownes, which in my Per≈øon I haue brought vnto you, my charge mu≈øt be the greater in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon: For the greater your King be, both in his dominion and number of Subiects, he cannot but be forced thereby to be at the more charge, and it is the more your honour, ≈øo to haue it.</p>
            <p>Next, that po≈øteritie and i≈ø≈øue which it hath plea≈øed God to ≈øend me for your v≈øe, cannot but bring nece≈ø≈øarily with it a greater proportion of charge. You all know that the late Queene of famous memory (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding her orbitie) had much giuen vnto her, and more then euer any of her predece≈ø≈øors had before her.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the time of creation of my Sonne doeth now draw neere, which I chu≈øe for the greater honour to bee done in this time of Parliament. As for him I ≈øay no more; the ≈øight of him≈øelfe here ≈øpeakes for him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is trew I haue ≈øpent much; but yet if I had ≈øpared any of tho≈øe things, which cau≈øed a great part of my expen≈øe, I ≈øhould haue di≈øho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored the kingdome, my ≈øelfe, and the late Queene. Should I haue ≈øpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the funerall of the late Queene? or the ≈øolemnitie of mine and my wiues entrie into this Kingdome, in ≈øome honourable ≈øort? or ≈øhould I haue ≈øpared our entrie into <hi>London,</hi> or our Coronation? And when mo≈øt of the Monarches, and great Princes in Chri≈øtendome ≈øent their Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to congratulate my comming hither, and ≈øome of them came in per≈øon, was I not bound, both for my owne honour, and the honour of the Kingdome, to giue them good entertainement? But in ca≈øe it might be obiected by ≈øome, that it is onely vpon occa≈øions of warre, that Kings obtaine great Supplies from their Subiects: notwith≈øtanding my interne Peace, I am yet in a kinde of warre, which if it bee without, the more is your ≈øafetie: For (as the Trea≈øurer tolde you at large) I am now forced both in re≈øpects of State, and my promi≈øe, and for the generall cau≈øe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to ≈øend a Supply of forces to <hi>Cleues,</hi> and how long that occa≈øion may la≈øt, or what greater ≈øupply the nece≈ø≈øitie of that Errand may draw mee vnto, no man can yet tell. Be≈øides that, although I haue put downe that forme of warlike keeping of <hi>Barwicke;</hi> yet are all tho≈øe commaunders my pen≈øioners that were the late Queenes ≈øouldiers. And I hope I ≈øu≈øtaine a prettie Seminarie of Souldiers in my Forts within this Kingdome, be≈øides
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:23110:293"/>the two cautionary Townes in the Low-countreys, <hi>Flu≈øhing</hi> and <hi>Brill.</hi> And as for <hi>Ireland,</hi> yee all know how vncertaine my charges are euer there, that people being ≈øo ea≈øily ≈øtirred, partly through their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and want of ciuilitie, and partly through their corruption in Religion to breake foorth in rebellions. Yee know, how vnlooked for a Rebellion brake foorth there the la≈øt yeere, which could not but put mee to extraordinary charges. Be≈øides I doe maintaine there continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally an Armie, which is a goodly Seminarie of expert and old Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And I dare neuer ≈øuffer the ≈øame to be dimini≈øhed, till this Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion take effect, which (no doubt) is the greate≈øt moate that euer came in the Rebels eyes: and it is to be looked for, that if euer they will bee able to make any ≈øtirre, they will pre≈ø≈øe at it by all meanes, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting and di≈øcouraging this Plantation. Now it is trew, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides all the≈øe honourable and nece≈ø≈øary occa≈øions of my charge, I haue ≈øpent much in liberalitie: but yet I hope you will con≈øider, that what I haue giuen, hath bene giuen among≈øt you; and ≈øo what comes in from you, goes out againe among≈øt you. But it may be thought that I haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen much among≈øt Scotti≈øhmen. Indeed if I had not beene liberall in rewarding ≈øome of my old ≈øeruants of that Nation, ye could neuer haue had rea≈øon to expect my thankefulne≈ø≈øe towards any of you that are more lately become my Subiects, if I had beene ingrate to the old: And yet yee will find, that I haue dealt twice as much among≈øt Engli≈øh men as I haue done to Scotti≈øhmen. And therefore he that in your Hou≈øe was not a≈øhamed to affirme, that the ≈øiluer and gold did ≈øo abound in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> was very farre mi≈øtaken; but I wi≈øh him no wor≈øe puni≈øhment, then that hee ≈øhould onely liue vpon ≈øuch profit of the money there. But I hope you will neuer mi≈ølike me for my liberalitie, ≈øince I can looke very few of you this day in the face, that haue not made ≈øuits to mee, at lea≈øt for ≈øome thing, either of honour or profit. It is trew, a Kings liberalitie mu≈øt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be dried vp altogether: for then he can neuer maintaine nor oblige his ≈øeruants and well de≈øeruing Subiects: But that va≈øtne≈ø≈øe of my expence is pa≈øt, which I v≈øed the fir≈øt two or three yeeres after my comming hither: And, as I oft v≈øed to ≈øay, that Chri≈øtmas and open tide is ended: For at my fir≈øt comming here, partly ignorance of this State (which no man can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire but by time and experience) and partly the forme of my comming being ≈øo honourable and miraculous, enforced me to extend my liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ≈øo much the more at the beginning. Ye ≈øaw I made Knights then by hundreths, and Barons in great numbers: but I hope you find I doe not ≈øo now, nor minde not to doe ≈øo hereafter. For to conclude this point a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent expences, I hold that a Kings expence mu≈øt alwayes bee honourable, though not wa≈øtefull, and the charges of your King in maintaining tho≈øe ancient honourable formes of liuing that the former Kings of <hi>England</hi> my Predece≈ø≈øours haue done, and his liuing to bee ruled according to the proportion of his greatne≈ø≈øe, is a≈øwell for the honour of your Kingdome,
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:23110:293"/>as of your King. Now this cannot be ≈øupplied out of the ayre or liquid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, but mu≈øt come from the people. And for remouing of that diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which men may haue, that I minde not to liue in any wa≈øtefull ≈øort hereafter, will you but looke vpon my ≈øelfe and my po≈øteritie; and if there were no more but that, it will teach you that if I were but a naturall man, I mu≈øt needs bee carefull of my expences: For as for my owne per≈øon, I hope none that knowes me well, can thinke me but as little inclined to any prodigall humours of vnnece≈ø≈øary things, as any other rea≈øonable man of a farre meaner e≈øtate. Therefore ≈øince (as I haue ≈øaid) I cannot be helped but from the people; I a≈ø≈øure my ≈øelfe that you will well allow mee ≈øuch mea≈øure of Supplie, as the people may beare, and ≈øupport him with more Honourable meanes then others haue had, that (as I may ≈øay without vaunting) hath brought you more Honour then euer you had: For I hope there are no good Subiects either within, or out of the Parliament Hou≈øe, that would not be content for ≈øetting ≈øtreight once and ≈øetling the Honourable State of their King, to ≈øpare ≈øo much euery one of them out of their pur≈øes, which peraduenture they would in one night throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at Dice or Cards, or be≈øtow vpon a hor≈øe for their fancies, that might breake his necke or his legge the next morning: Nay I am ≈øure euery good Subiect would rather chu≈øe to liue more ≈øparingly vpon his owne, then that his Kings State ≈øhould be in want.</p>
            <p>For conclu≈øion then of this purpo≈øe, I wi≈øh you now to put a ≈øpeedie end to your bu≈øine≈ø≈øe. Freene≈ø≈øe in giuing graceth the gift, <hi>Bis dat, qui cit√≤ dat;</hi> The longer I want helpe, the greater will my debt ≈øtill ri≈øe: and ≈øo mu≈øt I looke for the greater helpes. And now I would pray you to turne your eyes with mee from home, and looke vpon forreine States. Con≈øider that the eyes of all forreine States are vpon this affaire, and in expectation what the ≈øucce≈ø≈øe thereof will be; And what can they thinke, if ye depart without relieuing mee in that proportion that may make me able to maintaine my State, but that either ye are vnwilling to helpe mee, thinking me vnworthy thereof, or at lea≈øt that my State is ≈øo de≈øperate, as it cannot be repaired, and ≈øo that the Parliament parts in di≈øgrace with the King, and the King in di≈øta≈øte with the Parliament, which cannot but weaken my reputation both at home and abroad? For of this you may be a≈ø≈øured, that forreine Princes care the more one for an other, if they may haue rea≈øon to expect that they may bee able to doe them good or harme in Retribution. And ye know, that if a King fall to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with his neighbours, that cannot but bring an oppre≈ø≈øion and warre by them vpon him, and then will it be too late to ≈øupport the King, when the cure is almo≈øt de≈øperate. Things fore≈øeene and preuented, are euer ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølie≈øt remedied: And therefore I would adui≈øe you now ≈øo to ≈øettle your bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, as ye may not take in hand ≈øo many things at once, as may both cro≈ø≈øe my errand, and euery one of them cro≈ø≈øe another. Yee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the French Prouerbe, <hi>Qui trop embra≈ø≈øe, rien e≈øtreint;</hi> We are not in this
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:23110:294"/>Parliament to make our Te≈øtament, as if wee ≈øhould neuer meete againe, and that all things that were to be done in any Parliament, were to be done at this time: and yet for filling vp of your vacant houres, I will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to your con≈øideration ≈øuch nature of things, as are to bee ≈øpecially thought vpon in the≈øe times. Fir≈øt I will beginne at GOD: for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with him makes all other actions to bee ble≈ø≈øed: And this I meane by the cau≈øe of Religion. Next I will ≈øpeake of ≈øome things that concerne the Common-wealth. And thirdly, matters of Plea≈øure and ornament to the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>As for Religion, we haue all great cau≈øe to take heed vnto it; Papi≈øts are waxed as proud at this time as euer they were, which makes many to think they haue ≈øome new plotin hand. And although the poore≈øt ≈øort of them bee (God be thanked) much decrea≈øed, yet doeth the greater ≈øort of them dayly increa≈øe, e≈øpecially among the foeminine Sexe; nay they are waxed ≈øo proud, that ≈øome ≈øay, no man dare pre≈øent them, nor Iudges meddle with them, they are ≈øo backed and vpholden by diuers great Courtiers. It is a ≈øurer and better way to remooue the materials of fire before they bee kindled, then to quench the fire when once it is kindled.</p>
            <q>Nam leuius laedit quicquid praeuidimus ant√®.</q>
            <p>I doe not meane by this to mooue you to make ≈øtronger Lawes then are already made, but ≈øee tho≈øe Lawes may bee well executed that are in force; otherwi≈øe they cannot but fall into contempt and become ru≈øtie. I neuer found, that blood and too much ≈øeueritie did good in matters of Religion: for, be≈øides that it is a ≈øure rule in Diuinitie, that God neuer loues to plant his Church by violence and blood≈øhed, naturall rea≈øon may euen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade vs, and dayly experience prooues it trew, That when men are ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely per≈øecuted for Religion, the gallantne≈ø≈øe of many mens ≈øpirits, and the wilfulnes of their humors, rather then the iu≈øtne≈ø≈øe of the cau≈øe, makes them to take a pride boldy to endure any torments, or death it ≈øelfe, to gaine thereby the reputatiom of Martyrdome, though but in a fal≈øe ≈øhadow.</p>
            <p>Some doubts haue beene conceiued anent the v≈øing of the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, and that part of the Acte which ordaines the taking thereof, is thought ≈øo ob≈øcure, that no man can tell who ought to bee pre≈ø≈øed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. For I my ≈øelfe, when vpon a time I called the Iudges before mee at their going to their Circuits, I mooued this que≈øtion vnto them; wherein, as I thought they could not re≈øolutely an≈øwere me: And therefore if there bee any ≈øcruple touching the mini≈øtring of it, I would wi≈øh it now to bee cleared. And ≈øince I haue with my owne pen brought the Popes quarell vpon mee, and proclaimed publique defiance to <hi>Babylon</hi> in maintaining it; ≈øhould it now ≈øleepe, and ≈øhould I ≈øeeme (as it were) to ≈øteale from it againe?</p>
            <p>As for Recu≈øants, let them bee all duely pre≈øented without exception: for in times pa≈øt there hath beene too great a conniuence, and forbearing
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:23110:294"/>of them, e≈øpecially of great mens wiues, and their kinne and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. None ought to be ≈øpared from being brought vnder the danger of Law, and then it is my part to v≈øe mercie, as I thinke conuenient. To winke at faults, and not to ≈øuffer them to bee di≈øcouered, is no Honour, nor Mercy in a King, neither is he euer thanked for it; It onely argues his dulne≈ø≈øe: But to forgiue faults after they are confe≈ø≈øed, or tried, is Mercie. And now I mu≈øt turne me in this ca≈øe to you, my Lords the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops, and euen exhort you earne≈øtly, to be more carefull, then you haue bene, that your Officers may more duely pre≈øent Recu≈øants, then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore they haue done, without exception of per≈øons; That althought it mu≈øt be the worke of GOD that mu≈øt make their mindes to bee altered, yet at lea≈øt by this cour≈øe they may be ≈øtayed from increa≈øing, or in≈øulting vpon vs.</p>
            <p>And that yee all may know the trewth of my heart in this ca≈øe, I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide all my Subiects that are Papi≈øts, into two rankes: either olde Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øts, that were ≈øo brought vp in times of Poperie, like old Queene <hi>Mary</hi> Prie≈øts, and tho≈øe, that though they bee younger in yeeres, yet haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer drunke in other milke, but beene ≈øtill nu≈øled in that blindne≈ø≈øe: Or el≈øe ≈øuch as doe become Apo≈øtats; hauing once beene of our Profe≈ø≈øion, and haue for≈øaken the trewth, either vpon di≈øcontent, or practi≈øe, or el≈øe vpon a light vaine humour of Noueltie, making no more ≈øcruple to ≈øeeke out new formes of Religion, then if it were but a new forme of Garment, or a new cut or court≈øey after the French fa≈øhion.</p>
            <p>For the former ≈øort, I pitie them; but if they bee good and quiet Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, I hate not their per≈øons; and if I were a priuate man, I could well keepe a ciuill friend≈øhip and conuer≈øation with ≈øome of them: But as for tho≈øe Apo≈øtates, who, I know, mu≈øt be greate≈øt haters of their owne Sect, I confe≈ø≈øe I can neuer ≈øhew any fauourable countenance toward them, and they may all of them be ≈øure without exception, that they ≈øhall neuer finde any more fauour of mee, further then I mu≈øt needs in Iu≈øtice afford them. And the≈øe would I haue the Law to ≈øtrike ≈øeuerelie≈øt vpon, and you care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulle≈øt to di≈øcouer. Yee know there hath beene great ≈øtirre kept for beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Concealements the≈øe yeeres pa≈øt; and I pray you, let mee begge this concealement both of the Bi≈øhops, and Iudges, That Papi≈øts be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger concealed.</p>
            <p>Next, as concerning the Common wealth, I doe ≈øpecially recommend vnto you the framing of ≈øome new Statute for pre≈øeruation of woods. In the end of the la≈øt Se≈ø≈øion of Parliament, ye had a Bill among≈øt you of that ≈øubiect; but becau≈øe you found ≈øome faults therein, you ca≈øt out the whole Bil: But I could haue rather wi≈øhed that yee had either mended it, or made a new one; For to ca≈øt out the whole Bill becau≈øe of ≈øome faults, was euen as if a man, that had a new garment brought him, would chu≈øe rather to go na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, then haue his garment made fit for him: But on my co≈øcience, I cannot
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:23110:295"/>imagine why you ≈øhould ≈øo lightly haue e≈øteemed a thing, ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary for the Common wealth, if it were not out of a litle frowardne≈ø≈øe among≈øt you at that time, that what I then recommended earne≈øtly vnto you, it was the wor≈øe liked of. The maintenance of woods is a thing ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary for this Kingdome, as it cannot ≈øtand, nor be a Kingdome without it: For it concernes you both in your <hi>E≈ø≈øe, Bene e≈ø≈øe,</hi> and in plea≈øures. Your <hi>E≈ø≈øe:</hi> for without it you want the v≈øe of one of the mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øarie Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (which is Fire and fewell to dre≈ø≈øe your meate with; for neither can the people liue in the≈øe colde Countries, if they want fire altogether, nor yet can you dre≈ø≈øe your meate without it; and I thinke you will ill liue like the Cannibals vpon raw fle≈øh: for the education of this people is farre from that. As to your <hi>bene e≈ø≈øe;</hi> The decay of woods will nece≈ø≈øarily bring the decay of Shipping, which both is the ≈øecurity of this Kingdome, ≈øince God hath by nature made the Sea to bee the wall of this Iland; and the rather now, ≈øince God hath vnited it all in my Per≈øon and Crowne; As al≈øo by the decay of Shipping will you loo≈øe both all your forraine commodities that are fit for this countrey, and the venting of our owne, which is the lo≈ø≈øe of Trade, that is a maine pillar of this kingdome. And as for Plea≈øure, yee know my delight in Hunting and Hawking, and many of your ≈øelues are of the ≈øame minde; and all this mu≈øt needes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, by the decay of Woods: Ye haue rea≈øon therefore to prouide a good Law vpon this Subiect.</p>
            <p>Now as to the la≈øt point concerning matters of Plea≈øure, it con≈øi≈øts in the pre≈øeruing of Game, which is now almo≈øt vtterly de≈øtroyed through all the Kingdome. And if you offer not now a better Law for this, then was made in the la≈øt Se≈ø≈øion of Parliament, I will neuer thanke you for it: For as for your Law anent Partridge and Phe≈øant, you haue giuen leaue to euery man how poore a Farmour that euer hee bee, to take and de≈øtroy them in his owne ground how he li≈øt. But I pray you, how can the Game bee maintained, if Gentlemen that haue great Lord≈øhips ≈øhall breed and pre≈øerue them there, and ≈øo ≈øoone as euer they ≈øhall but flie ouer the hedge and light in a poore fellowes Clo≈øe, they ≈øhall all be de≈øtroyed? Surely I know no remedie for pre≈øeruing the Game that breedes in my grounds, except I ca≈øt a roofe ouer all the ground, or el≈øe put veruels to the Partrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges feet with my Armes vpon them, as my Hawkes haue: otherwi≈øe I know not how they ≈øhall bee knowen to be the Kings Partridges, when they light in a Farmours Clo≈øe.</p>
            <p>And by your Lawe again≈øt ≈øtealing of Deere or Conies, after a long di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe and prohibition of ≈øtealing them, you conclude in the end with a re≈øtriction, that all this puni≈øhment ≈øhall bee vnder≈øtood to bee v≈øed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt them that ≈øteale the Game in the night: Which hath much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged all the loo≈øer ≈øort of people, that it is no fault to ≈øteale Deere, ≈øo they doe it not like theeues in the night. As was that Law of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
               <pb n="547" facs="tcp:23110:295"/>again≈øt theft, that did not forbid theft, but onely taught them to doe it cunningly, and without di≈øcouerie: Whereupon a fooli≈øh boy ≈øuffered a Foxe to gnaw his heart through his brea≈øt. And this doctrine is like that Le≈ø≈øon of the Cannon Law, <hi>Si non ca≈øt√®, tamen caut√®.</hi> I knowe you thinke that I ≈øpeake partially in this ca≈øe like a Hunter; But there is neuer a one of you that heares mee, that cares the lea≈øt for the ≈øport, for pre≈øeruation of the Game, but he would be as glad to haue a pa≈øtie of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øon if you might get it, as the be≈øt Hunter would: And if the Game be not pre≈øerued, you can eate no Veni≈øon. As for Partridge and Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant, I doe not denie that Gentlemen ≈øhould haue their ≈øport, and ≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vpon their owne ground. But fir≈øt I doe not thinke ≈øuch Game and plea≈øures ≈øhould be free to ba≈øe people. And next I would euen wi≈øh that Gentlemen ≈øhould v≈øe it in a Gentlemanlike fa≈øhion, and not with Nets, or Gunnes, or ≈øuch other vngentlemanlike fa≈øhions that ≈øerue but for vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter de≈øtruction of all Game, nor yet to kill them at vn≈øea≈øonable times, as to kill the Phe≈øant and Partridges when they are no bigger then Mice, when as for euery one their Hawkes kill, ten will be de≈øtroyed with their Dogs and Hor≈øe feet; be≈øides the great and intolerable harme they doe to Corne in that ≈øea≈øon.</p>
            <p>And now in the end of all this fa≈øchious Speach, I mu≈øt conclude like a Grey Frier, in ≈øpeaking for my ≈øelfe at la≈øt. At the beginning of this Se≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of Parliament, when the Trea≈øourer opened my nece≈ø≈øities vnto you, then my Pur≈øe onely laboured; But now that word is ≈øpread both at home and abroad of the demaunds I haue made vnto you; my Reputation la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth a≈øwellas my Pur≈øe: For if you part without the repairing of my State in ≈øome rea≈øonable ≈øort, what can the world thinke, but that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill will my Subiects beare vnto mee, hath bred a refu≈øe? And yee can neuer part ≈øo, without apprehending that I am di≈øta≈øted with your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, and yet to be in feare of my di≈øplea≈øure. But I a≈ø≈øure and promi≈øe my ≈øelfe farre otherwi≈øe.</p>
            <p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>IVE THY IVDGEMENTS TO THE KING, O GOD, AND THY RIGHTEOVSNES TO THE KINGS SONNE.</p>
            <p>The≈øe be the fir≈øt words of one of the P≈øalmes of the Kingly Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> whereof the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ≈øen≈øe runnes vpon him, and his ≈øonne <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and the my≈øticall ≈øen≈øe vpon GOD and CHRIST his eternall Sonne: but they are both ≈øo wouen together, as ≈øome parts are, and can onely bee properly applied vnto GOD and CHRIST, and other parts vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> as this Ver≈øe, <hi>Giue thy Iudgements to the King, O God, and thy Righteou≈øne≈øse to the Kings Sonne,</hi> cannot be properly ≈øpoken of any, but of <hi>Dauid</hi> and his ≈øonne; becau≈øe it is ≈øaid, <hi>Giue thy Iudgements, &amp;c.</hi> Now God cannot giue to him≈øelfe. In another part of the ≈øame P≈øalme, where it is ≈øaid, that <hi>Righteou≈ønes ≈øhall flouri≈øh, and abundance of Peace, as long as the Moone endureth,</hi> it ≈øignifieth eternitie, and cannot be properly applied but to GOD and CHRIST: But both ≈øen≈øes, a≈øwell literall as my≈øticall, ≈øerue to Kings for imitation, and e≈øpecially to Chri≈øtian Kings: for Kings ≈øit in the Throne of GOD, and they them≈øelues are called Gods.</p>
            <p>And therefore all good Kings in their gouernment, mu≈øt imitate GOD
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:23110:297"/>and his Chri≈øt, in being iu≈øt and righteous; <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> in being godly and wi≈øe: To be wi≈øe, is vnder≈øtood, able to di≈øcerne, able to iudge others: To be godly is, that the fountaine be pure whence the ≈øtreames proceed: for what auailes it though all his workes be godly, if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not from godline≈ø≈øe: To bee righteous, is to a mans ≈øelfe: To bee iu≈øt, is towards others. But Iu≈øtice in a King auailes not, vnle≈ø≈øe it be with a cleane heart: for except he bee Righteous a≈øwell as Iu≈øt, he is no good King; and what≈øoeuer iu≈øtice he doeth; except he doeth it for Iu≈øtice ≈øake, and out of the purene≈ø≈øe of his owne heart, neither from priuate ends, vaine-glory, or any other by-re≈øpects of his owne, all ≈øuch Iu≈øtice is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and no trew Iu≈øtice. From this imitation of GOD and CHRIST, in who≈øe Throne wee ≈øit, the gouernment of all Common-wealths, and e≈øpecially Monarchies, hath bene from the beginning ≈øetled and e≈øtabli≈øhed. Kings are properly Iudges, and Iudgement properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them from GOD: for Kings ≈øit in the Throne of GOD, and thence all Iudgement is deriued.</p>
            <p>In all well ≈øetled Monarchies, where Law is e≈øtabli≈øhed formerly and orderly, there Iudgement is deferred from the King to his ≈øubordinate Magi≈øtrates; not that the King takes it from him≈øelfe, but giues it vnto them: So it comes not to them <hi>Priuatiu√®,</hi> but <hi>cumulatiu√®,</hi> as the Shoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ≈øpeake. The ground is ancient, euer ≈øithence that Coun≈øell which <hi>Iethro</hi> gaue to <hi>Mo≈øes:</hi> for after that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> had gouerned a long time, in his owne per≈øon, the burthen grew ≈øo great, hauing none to helpe him, as his father in law comming to vi≈øite him, found him ≈øo cumbred with mini≈øtring of Iu≈øtice, that neither the people were ≈øatisfied, nor he well able to performe it; Therefore by his aduice, Iudges were deputed for ea≈øier que≈øtions, and the greater and more profound were left to <hi>Mo≈øes:</hi> And according to this e≈øtabli≈øhment; all Kings that haue had a formall gouernement, e≈øpecially Chri≈øtian Kings in all aages haue gouerned their people, though after a diuers maner.</p>
            <p>This Deputation is after one manner in <hi>France,</hi> after another here, and euen my owne Kingdomes differ in this point of gouernment: for <hi>Scotland</hi> differs both from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> herein; but all agree in this, (I ≈øpeake of ≈øuch Kingdomes or States where the formalitie of Law hath place) that the King that ≈øits in Gods Throne, onely deputes ≈øubal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne Iudges, and he deputes not one but a number (for no one ≈øubalterne Iudges mouth makes Law) and their office is to interprete Law, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øter Iu≈øtice. But as to the number of them, the forme of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the maner of interpretation, the di≈øtinction of Benches, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer≈øitie of Courts; the≈øe varie according to the varietie of gouernment, and in≈øtitution of diuers Kings: So this ground I lay, that the ≈øeate of Iudgement is properly Gods, and Kings are Gods Vicegerents; and by Kings Iudges are deputed vnder them, to beare the burden of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the fir≈øt example of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> by the aduice of <hi>Iethro,</hi> and
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:23110:297"/>≈øithence practi≈øed by <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> the wi≈øe≈øt Kings that euer were; which is in this P≈øalme ≈øo interlaced, that as the fir≈øt ver≈øe cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied properly but to <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> in the words, <hi>Giue thy Iudgements to the King,</hi> &amp;c. So the other place in the ≈øame P≈øalme, <hi>Righteou≈øne≈øse ≈øhall flouri≈øh, and abundance of peace ≈øhall remaine as long as the Moone endureth,</hi> properly ≈øignifieth the eternitie of CHRIST. This I ≈øpeake, to ≈øhew what a neere coniunction there is betweene God and the King vpward, and the King and his Iudges downewards: for the ≈øame coniunction that is betweene God and the King vpward; the ≈øame coniunction is betweene the King and his Iudges downewards.</p>
            <p>As Kings borrow their power from God, ≈øo Iudges from Kings: And as Kings are to accompt to God, ≈øo Iudges vnto God and Kings; and both Kings and Iudges by imitation, haue two qualities from God and his Chri≈øt, and two qualities from <hi>Dauid</hi> and his <hi>Salomon:</hi> Iudgement and Righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, from God and Chri≈øt: Godline≈ø≈øe and Wi≈øedome from <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon.</hi> And as no King can di≈øcharge his accompt to God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe he make con≈øcience not to alter, but to declare and e≈øtabli≈øh the will of God: So Iudges cannot di≈øcharge their accompts to Kings, vnle≈ø≈øe they take the like care, not to take vpon them to make Law, but ioyned together after a deliberate con≈øultation, to declare what the Law is; For as Kings are ≈øubiect vnto Gods Law, ≈øo they to mans Law. It is the Kings Office to protect and ≈øettle the trew interpretation of the Law of God within his Dominions: And it is the Iudges Office to interprete the Law of the King, whereto them≈øelues are al≈øo ≈øubiect.</p>
            <p>Hauing now perfourmed this ancient Prouerbe, <hi>A Ioue principium;</hi> which though it was ≈øpoken by a Pagan, yet it is good and holy: I am now to come to my particular Errand, for which I am heere this day; wherein I mu≈øt handle two parts: Fir≈øt, the rea≈øon why I haue not the≈øe fourteene yeeres, ≈øithence my Coronation vntill now, ≈øatisfied a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my louing ≈øubiects, who I know haue had a great expectation, and as it were a longing, like them that are with child, to heare mee ≈øpeake in this place, where my Predece≈ø≈øors haue often ≈øitten, and e≈øpecially King <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øeuenth, from whom, as diuers wayes before, I am lineally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcended, and that doubly to this Crowne; and as I am neere≈øt de≈øcended of him, ≈øo doe I de≈øire to follow him in his be≈øt actions.</p>
            <p>The next part is the rea≈øon, Why I am now come: The cau≈øe that made mee ab≈øtaine, was this: When I came into <hi>England,</hi> although I was an old King, pa≈øt middle aage, and practi≈øed in gouernment euer ≈øithence I was twelue yeeres olde; yet being heere a ≈øtranger in gouernement, though not in blood, becau≈øe my breeding was in another Kingdome; I re≈øolued therefore with <hi>Pythagoras</hi> to keepe ≈øilence ≈øeuen yeeres, and learne my ≈øelfe the Lawes of this Kingdome, before I would take vpon mee to teach them vnto others: When this Apprenti≈øhip was ended, then another impediment came, which was in the choice of that cau≈øe, that ≈øhould fir≈øt
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:23110:298"/>bring me hither. I expected ≈øome great cau≈øe to make my fir≈øt entry vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For I thought that hauing ab≈øtained ≈øo long, it ≈øhould be a worthy matter that ≈øhould bring mee hither. Now euery cau≈øe mu≈øt be great or ≈ømall: In ≈ømall cau≈øes I thought it di≈øgracefull to come, hauing beene ≈øo long ab≈øent: In great cau≈øes, they mu≈øt be either betwixt the King and ≈øome of his Subiects, or betwixt Subiect and Subiect.</p>
            <p>In a cau≈øe where my ≈øelfe was concerned, I was loath to come, becau≈øe men ≈øhould not thinke I did come for my owne priuate, either Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue or profit; or for any other by-re≈øpect: And in that ca≈øe I will alwayes abide the triall of men and Angels, neuer to haue had any particular end, in that which is the Maine of all things, <hi>Iu≈øtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a great cau≈øe al≈øo betweene partie and partie, great in re≈øpect either of the que≈øtion, or value of the thing, my comming might ≈øeeme, as it were obliquely, to be in fauour of one partie, and for that cau≈øe this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øellour, or that Courtier might be thought to mooue me to come hither; And a meane cau≈øe was not worthy of mee, e≈øpecially for my fir≈øt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance: So lacke of choice in both re≈øpects kept mee off till now: And now hauing pa≈ø≈øed a double apprenti≈øhip of twice ≈øeuen yeeres, I am come hither to ≈øpeake vnto you. And next as to the rea≈øons of my comming at this time, they are the≈øe.</p>
            <p>I haue ob≈øerued in the time of my whole Reigne here, and my double Apprenti≈øhip, diuers things fallen out in the Iudicatures here at <hi>We≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min≈øter</hi> Hall, that I thought required and vrged a reformation at my hands; whereupon I re≈øolued with my ≈øelfe, that I could not more fitly begin a reformation, then here to make an open declaration of my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. I remember Chri≈øts ≈øaying, <hi>My ≈øheepe heare my voyce,</hi> and ≈øo I a≈ø≈øure my ≈øelfe, my people will mo≈øt willingly heare the voyce of me, their owne Shepheard and King; whereupon I tooke this occa≈øion in mine owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon here in this Seate of Iudgement, not iudicially, but declaratorily and openly to giue tho≈øe directions, which, at other times, by piece-meale, I haue deliuered to ≈øome of you in diuers le≈ø≈øe publike places; but now will put it vp in all your audience, where I hope it ≈øhall bee trewly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and cannot be mi≈øtaken, as it might haue bene when it was ≈øpoken more priuately: I will for order ≈øake take mee to the methode of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Three, the number of perfection, and vpon that number di≈øtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute all I haue to declare to you.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Ir≈øt, I am to giue a charge to my ≈øelfe: for a King, or Iudge vnder a King, that fir≈øt giues not a good charge to him≈øelfe, will neuer be able to giue a good charge to his inferiours; for as I haue ≈øaid, Good riuers cannot flow but from good ≈øprings; if the fountaine be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, ≈øo mu≈øt the riuers be.</p>

               <pb n="553" facs="tcp:23110:298"/>Fir≈øt, I prote≈øt to you all, in all your audience, heere ≈øitting in the ≈øeate of Iu≈øtice, belonging vnto GOD, and now by right fallen vnto mee, that I haue re≈øolued, as Confirmation in Maioritie followeth Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øme in minoritie; ≈øo now after many yeeres, to renew my promi≈øe and Oath made at my Coronation concerning Iu≈øtice, and the promi≈øe therein for maintenance of the Law of the Land. And I prote≈øt in GODS pre≈øence, my care hath euer beene to keepe my con≈øcience cleare in all the points of my Oath, taken at my Coronation, ≈øo farre as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailtie may permit mee, or my knowledge enforme mee, I ≈øpeake in point of Iu≈øtice and Law; For Religion, I hope I am rea≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably well knowen already: I meane therefore of Lawe and Iu≈øtice; and for Law, I meane the Common Law of the Land, according to which the King gouernes, and by which the people are gouerned. For the Common Law, you can all beare mee witne≈ø≈øe, I neuer pre≈ø≈øed altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in Parliament; but on the contrary, when I endeauoured mo≈øt an Vnion reall, as was already in my per≈øon, my de≈øire was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Lawes of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and not the Law of <hi>England</hi> to the Law of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and ≈øo the prophecie to be trew of my wi≈øe Grandfather <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øeuenth, who foretold that the le≈ø≈øer Kingdome by marriage, would follow the greater, and not the greater the le≈ø≈øer; And therefore married his elde≈øt daughter <hi>Margaret</hi> to <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth, my great Grandfather.</p>
            <p>It was a fooli≈øh Querke of ≈øome Iudges, who held that the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> could not vnite <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> by the name of <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> but that it would make an alteration of the Lawes, though I am ≈øince come to that knowledge, that an Acte of Parliament can doe greater wonders: And that old wi≈øe man the Trea≈øourer <hi>Burghley</hi> was wont to ≈øay, Hee knew not what an Acte of Parliament could not doe in <hi>England;</hi> For my intention was alwayes to effect vnion by vniting <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> and not <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Scotland:</hi> For I euer meant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euer re≈øolued, that this Law ≈øhould continue in this Kingdome, and two things mooued mee thereunto; One is, that in matter of Policie and State, you ≈øhall neuer ≈øee any thing anciently and maturely e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhed, but by Innouation or alteration it is wor≈øe then it was, I meane not by purging of it from corruptions, and re≈øtoring it to the ancient integritie; Another rea≈øon was, I was ≈øworne to maintaine the Law of the Land, and therefore I had beene periured if I had altered it; And this I ≈øpeake to root out the conceit and mi≈øapprehen≈øion, if it be in any heart, that I would change, damnifie, vilifie or ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe the Law of this Land: GOD is my Iudge I neuer meant it; And this confirmation I make before you all.</p>
            <p>To this I ioyne the point of Iu≈øtice, which I call <hi>Vnicuique ≈øuum tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buere.</hi> All my Councell, and Iudges dead and aliue, can, and could beare mee witne≈ø≈øe, how vnpartiall I haue beene in declaring of Law.
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:23110:299"/>And where it hath concerned mee in my owne inheritance, I haue as willingly ≈øubmitted my intere≈øt to the Lawe, as any my Subiects could doe; and it becomes mee ≈øo to doe, to giue example to others: much le≈ø≈øe then will I be partiall to others, where I am not to my ≈øelfe. And ≈øo re≈øolue your ≈øelues, Iu≈øtice with mee may bee moderated in point of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie: for no Iu≈øtice can be without mercie. But in matters of Iu≈øtice to giue euery man his owne, to be blinde without eyes of partialitie; This is my full re≈øolution.</p>
            <p>I v≈øed to ≈øay when I was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> if any man mooued mee to delay Iu≈øtice, that it was again≈øt the Office of a King ≈øo to doe; But when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny made ≈øuite to ha≈øten Iu≈øtice, I told them I had rather grant fourtie of the≈øe ≈øuits, then one of the other: This was alwayes my cu≈øtome and ≈øhall be euer, with Gods leaue.</p>
            <p>Now what I haue ≈øpoken of Law and Iu≈øtice, I meane by the Lawe kept in her owne bounds: For I vnder≈øtand the inheritance of the King, and Subiects in this land, mu≈øt bee determined by the Common Law,  and that is, by the Law ≈øet downe in our forefathers time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by learned men diuers times after in the declaratory Comments, called <hi>Respon≈øa Prudentum;</hi> Or el≈øe by Statute Law ≈øet downe by Acte of Parliament, as occa≈øion ≈øerues: By this I doe not ≈øeclude all other Lawes of <hi>England;</hi> but this is the Law of inheritance in this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>There is another Law, of all Lawes free and ≈øupreame, which is GODS LAVV: And by this all Common and municipall Lawes mu≈øt be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: And except they haue dependance vpon this Law, they are vniu≈øt and vnlawfull.</p>
            <p>When I ≈øpeake of that Law, I onely giue this touch, That that Law in this Kingdome hath beene too much neglected, and Churchmen too much had in contempt; I mu≈øt ≈øpeake trewth, Great men, Lords, Iudges, and people of all degrees from the highe≈øt to the lowe≈øt, haue too much contemned them: And God will not ble≈ø≈øe vs in our owne Lawes, if wee doe not reuerence and obey GODS LAVV; which cannot bee, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the interpreters of it be re≈øpected and reuerenced.</p>
            <p>And it is a ≈øigne of the latter dayes drawing on; euen the contempt of the Church, and of the Gouernours and Teachers thereof now in the Church of ENGLAND, which I ≈øay in my Con≈øcience, of any Church that euer I read or knew of, pre≈øent or pa≈øt, is mo≈øt pure, and neere≈øt the Primitiue and Apo≈øtolicall Church in Doctrine and Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and is ≈øurelie≈øt founded vpon the word of God, of any Church in Chri≈øtendome.</p>
            <p>Next vnto this Law is the Law of Nations, which God forbid ≈øhould bee barred, and that for two cau≈øes: One, becau≈øe it is a Law to ≈øatisfie Strangers, which will not ≈øo well hold them≈øelues ≈øatisfied with other municipall Lawes: Another, to ≈øatisfie our owne Subiects in matters of Piracie, Marriage, Wills, and things of like nature: That Law I
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:23110:299"/>diuide into Ciuil and Canon; And this Law hath bene ≈øo much encroched vpon, ≈øithence my comming to the Crowne, and ≈øo had in contempt, that young men are di≈øcouraged from ≈øtudying, and the re≈øt wearie of their liues that doe profe≈ø≈øe it, and would be glad to ≈øeeke any other craft.</p>
            <p>So, ≈øpeaking of the Common Law, I meane the Common Law kept within her owne limits, and not derogating from the≈øe other Lawes, which by longer cu≈øtome haue beene rooted here; fir≈øt, the Law of GOD and his Church; and next, the Law Ciuill and Canon, which in many ca≈øes cannot be wanting.</p>
            <p>To conclude this charge which I giue my ≈øelfe, I profe≈ø≈øe to maintaine all the points of mine Oath, e≈øpecially in Lawes, and of Lawes, e≈øpecially the Common Law.</p>
            <p>And as to maintaine it, ≈øo to purge it; for el≈øe it cannot bee maintained: and e≈øpecially to purge it from two corruptions, Incertaintie and Nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Incertaintie is found in the Law it ≈øelfe, wherein I will bee painefull to cleare it to the people; and this is properly to bee done in Parliament by aduice of the Iudges.</p>
            <p>The other corruption is introduced by the Iudges them≈øelues, by Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities that are v≈øed, where it may be ≈øaid, <hi>Ab initio non fuit ≈øic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing in the world is more likely to be permanent to our eyes then yron or ≈øteele, yet the ru≈øt corrupts it, if it bee not kept cleane: which ≈øheweth, nothing is permanent here in this world, if it be not purged; So I cannot di≈øcharge my con≈øcience in maintaining the Lawes, if I keepe them not cleane from corruption.</p>
            <p>And now that I may bee like the Pa≈øtor, that fir≈øt takes the Sacrament him≈øelfe, and then giues it to the people: So I haue fir≈øt taken my owne charge vpon me, before I giue you your Charge, le≈øt it might be ≈øaid,

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow my Lords the Iudges for your parts, the Charge I haue to giue you, con≈øi≈øts likewi≈øe in three parts.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt in generall, that you doe Iu≈øtice vprightly, as you ≈øhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwere to GOD and mee: For as I haue onely GOD to an≈øwere to, and to expect puni≈øhment at his hands, if I offend; So you are to an≈øwere both to GOD and to mee, and expect puni≈øhment at GODS hands and mine, if you be found in fault.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to doe Iu≈øtice indifferently betweene Subiect and Subiect, betweene King and Subiect, without delay, partialitie, feare or bribery, with ≈øtout and vpright hearts, with cleane and vncorrupt hands.</p>
            <p>When I bid you doe Iu≈øtice boldly, yet I bid you doe it fearefully; fearefully in this, to vtter your owne conceites, and not the trew mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Law: And remember you are no makers of Law, but Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretours of Law, according to the trew ≈øence thereof; for your Office is <hi>Ius dicere,</hi> and not <hi>Ius dare:</hi> And that you are ≈øo farre from making Law, that euen in the higher hou≈øe of Parliament, you haue no voyce in
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:23110:300"/>making of a Law, but only to giue your aduice when you are required.</p>
            <p>And though the Laws be in many places ob≈øcure, and not ≈øo wel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the multitude as to you; and that there are many parts that come not into ordinary practi≈øe, which are knowen to you, becau≈øe you can finde out the rea≈øon thereof by bookes and pre≈øidents; yet know this, that your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations mu≈øt be alwayes ≈øubiect to common ≈øen≈øe and rea≈øon.</p>
            <p>For I will neuer tru≈øt any Interpretation, that agreeth not with my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ≈øen≈øe and rea≈øon, and trew Logicke: for <hi>Ratio e≈øt anima Legis</hi> in all humane Lawes, without exception; it mu≈øt not be Sophi≈øtrie or ≈øtraines of wit that mu≈øt interprete, but either cleare Law, or ≈øolide rea≈øon.</p>
            <p>But in Countreys where the formalitie of Law hath no place, as in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> which I may trewly report, as hauing my ≈øelfe beene an eye-witne≈ø≈øe thereof; all their State is gouerned onely by a written Law; there is no Aduocate or Proctour admitted to plead, onely the parties them≈øelues plead their owne cau≈øe, and then a man ≈øtands vp and reads the Law, and there is an end, for the very Law-booke it ≈øelfe is their onely Iudge. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py were all Kingdomes if they could be ≈øo: But heere, curious wits, various conceits, different actions, and varietie of examples breed que≈øtions in Law: And therefore when you heare the que≈øtions if they be plaine, there is a plaine way in it ≈øelfe; if they be ≈øuch as are not plaine (for mens inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions dayly abound) then are you to interprete according to common ≈øen≈øe, and draw a good and certaine <hi>Minor</hi> of naturall rea≈øon, out of the <hi>Maior</hi> of direct Lawe, and thereupon to make a right and trew <hi>Conclu≈øion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For though the Common Law be a my≈øtery and skill be≈øt knowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ≈øelues, yet if your interpretation be ≈øuch, as other men which haue Logicke and common ≈øen≈øe vnder≈øtand not the rea≈øon, I will neuer tru≈øt ≈øuch an Interpretation.</p>
            <p>Remember al≈øo you are Iudges, and not a Iudge; and diuided into Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which ≈øheweth that what you doe, that you ≈øhould doe with aduice and deliberation, not ha≈øtily and ra≈øhly, before you well ≈øtudy the ca≈øe, and conferre together; debating it duely, not giuing ≈øingle opinions, <hi>per emendicata ≈øuffragia;</hi> and ≈øo to giue your Iudgement, as you will an≈øwer to God and me.</p>
            <p>Now hauing ≈øpoken of your Office in generall, I am next to come to the limits wherein you are to bound your≈øelues, which likewi≈øe are three. Fir≈øt, Incroach not vpon the Prerogatiue of the Crowne: If there fall out a que≈øtion that concernes my Prerogatiue or my≈øtery of State, deale not with it, till you con≈øult with the King or his Councell, or both: for they are tran≈øcendent matters, and mu≈øt not be ≈øliberely ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with ouer-ra≈øh wilfulne≈ø≈øe; for ≈øo may you wound the King through the ≈øides of a priuate per≈øon: and this I commend vnto your ≈øpeciall care, as ≈øome of you of late haue done very well, to blunt the ≈øharpe edge and vaine popular humour of ≈øome Lawyers at the Barre,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:23110:300"/>that thinke they are not eloquent and bold ≈øpirited enough, except they meddle with the Kings Prerogatiue: But doe not you ≈øuffer this; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely if this liberty be ≈øuffered, the Kings Prerogatiue, the Crowne, and I, ≈øhall bee as much wounded by their pleading, as if you re≈øolued what they di≈øputed: That which concernes the my≈øterie of the Kings power, is not lawfull to be di≈øputed; for that is to wade into the weakene≈ø≈øe of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to take away the my≈øticall reuerence, that belongs vnto them that ≈øit in the Throne of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That you keepe your≈øelues within your owne Benches, not to inuade other Iuri≈ødictions, which is vnfit, and an vnlawful thing; In this I mu≈øt inlarge my ≈øelfe. Be≈øides the Courts of Common Law, there is the Court of Reque≈øts; the Admiraltie Court; the Court of the Pre≈øident and Councell of Walles, the Pre≈øident and Councell of the North; High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion Courts, euery Bi≈øhop in his owne Court.</p>
            <p>The≈øe Courts ought to keepe their owne limits and boundes of their Commi≈ø≈øion and In≈øtructions, according to the ancient Pre≈øidents: And like as I declare that my plea≈øure is, that euery of the≈øe ≈øhall keepe their owne limits and boundes; So the Courts of Common Lawe are not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach vpon them, no more then it is my plea≈øure that they ≈øhould encroach vpon the Common Law. And this is a thing Regall and proper to a King, to keepe euery Court within his owne bounds.</p>
            <p>In <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter</hi> Hall there are foure Courts: Two that handle cau≈øes Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, which are the Common-pleas, and the Exchequer: Two that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine cau≈øes Criminall, which are the Kings-Bench, and the Starre-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where now I ≈øit. The Common-Pleas is a part and branch of the Kings-Bench; for it was fir≈øt all one Court; and then the Common-Pleas being extracted, it was called Common-Pleas; becau≈øe it medled with the Pleas of Priuate per≈øons, and that which remained, the Kings-Bench. The other of the Courts for ciuill Cau≈øes, is the Exchequer, which was ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the Kings Reuenew: That is the principall In≈øtitution of that Court, and ought to be their chiefe ≈øtudie; and as other things come order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thither by occa≈øion of the former, they may be handled, and Iu≈øtice there admini≈øtred.</p>
            <p>Keepe you therefore all in your owne bounds, and for my part, I de≈øire you to giue me no more right in my priuate Prerogatiue, then you giue to any Subiect; and therein I will be acquie≈øcent: As for the ab≈øolute Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of the Crowne, that is no Subiect for the tongue of a Lawyer, nor is lawfull to be di≈øputed.</p>
            <p>It is Athie≈øme and bla≈øphemie to di≈øpute what God can doe: good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians content them≈øelues with his will reuealed in his word. ≈øo, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumption and high contempt in a Subiect, to di≈øpute what a King can doe, or ≈øay that a King cannot doe this, or that; but re≈øt in that which is the Kings reuealed will in his Law.</p>
            <p>The Kings-Bench is the principall Court for criminall cau≈øes, and in
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:23110:301"/>≈øome re≈øpects it deales with Ciuill cau≈øes.</p>
            <p>Then is there a Chancerie Court; this is a Court of Equitie, and hath power to deale likewi≈øe in Ciuill cau≈øes: It is called the di≈øpen≈øer of the Kings Con≈øcience, following alwayes the intention of Law and Iu≈øtice; not altering the Law, not making that blacke which other Courts made white, nor <hi>√® conuer≈øo;</hi> But in this it exceeds other Courts, mixing Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie with Iu≈øtice, where other Courts proceed onely according to the ≈øtrict rules of Law: And where the rigour of the Law in many ca≈øes will vndoe a Subiect, there the Chancerie tempers the Law with equitie, and ≈øo mixeth Mercy with Iu≈øtice, as it pre≈øerues men from de≈øtruction.</p>
            <p>And thus (as before I told you) is the Kings Throne e≈øtabli≈øhed by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Iu≈øtice.</p>
            <p>The Chancerie is vndependant of any other Court, and is onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King: There it is written <hi>Te≈øte meip≈øo;</hi> from that Court there is no Appeale. And as I am bound in my Con≈øcience to maintaine eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Courts Iuri≈ødiction, ≈øo e≈øpecially this, and not ≈øuffer it to ≈øu≈øtaine wrong; yet ≈øo to maintaine it, as to keepe it within the owne limits, and free from corruption. My Chancellour that now is, I found him Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Seale, the ≈øame place in ≈øub≈øtance, although I gaue him the Stile of Chancellour, and God hath kept him in it till now; and I pray God he may hold it long; and ≈øo I hope he will. He will beare mee witne≈ø≈øe, I neuer gaue him other warrant, then to goe on in his Court according to Pre≈øidents, warranted by Law in the time of the be≈øt gouerning Kings, and mo≈øt learned Chancellours: The≈øe were the limits I gaue vnto him; beyond the ≈øame limits he hath promi≈øed me he will neuer goe.</p>
            <p>And as he hath promi≈øed me to take no other Iuri≈ødiction to him≈øelfe, ≈øo is it my promi≈øe euer to maintaine this Iuri≈ødiction in that Court: Therefore I ≈øpeake this to vindicate that Court from mi≈øconceipt and contempt.</p>
            <p>It is the duetie of Iudges to puni≈øh tho≈øe that ≈øeeke to depraue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of any the Kings Courts, and not to encourage them any way: And I mu≈øt confe≈ø≈øe I thought it an odious and inept ≈øpeach, and it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me very much, that it ≈øhould be ≈øaid in <hi>Westmin≈øter</hi> Hall, that a <hi>Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire</hi> lay again≈øt the Court of the Chancery and Officers there: How can the King grant a <hi>Premunire</hi> again≈øt him≈øelfe?</p>
            <p>It was a fooli≈øh, inept, and pre≈øumptuous attempt, and fitter for the time of ≈øome vnworthy King: vnder≈øtand mee aright; I meane not, the Chancerie ≈øhould exceed his limite; but on the other part; the King onely is to correct it, and none el≈øe: And therefore I was greatly abu≈øed in that attempt: For if any was wronged there, the complaint ≈øhould haue come to mee. None of you but will confe≈ø≈øe you haue a King of rea≈øonable vnder≈øtanding, and willing to reforme; why then ≈øhould you ≈øpare to complaine to me, that being the high way, and not goe the other way, and backe-way, in contempt of our Authoritie?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="559" facs="tcp:23110:301"/>And therefore ≈øitting heere in a ≈øeat of Iudgement, I declare and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that no man hereafter pre≈øume to ≈øue a <hi>Premunire</hi> again≈øt the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery; which I may the more ea≈øily doe, becau≈øe no <hi>Premunire</hi> can bee ≈øued but at my Suit: And I may iu≈øtly barre my ≈øelfe at mine owne plea≈øure.</p>
            <p>As all inundations come with ouerflowing the bankes, and neuer come without great inconuenience, and are thought prodigious by A≈øtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in things to come: So is this ouerflowing the bankes of your Iuri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in it ≈øelfe inconuenient, and may proue prodigious to the State.</p>
            <p>Remember therefore, that hereafter you keepe within your limits and Iuri≈ødictions. It is a ≈øpeciall point of my Office to procure and command, that among≈øt Courts there bee a concordance, and mu≈øicall accord; and it is your parts to obey, and ≈øee this kept: And, as you are to ob≈øerue the ancient Lawes and cu≈øtomes of <hi>England;</hi> ≈øo are you to keepe your ≈øelues within the bound of direct Law, or Pre≈øidents; and of tho≈øe, not euery ≈ønatched Pre≈øident, carped now here, now there, as it were running by the way; but ≈øuch as haue neuer beene controuerted, but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, approued by common v≈øage, in times of be≈øt Kings, and by mo≈øt learned Iudges.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Starre-Chamber</hi> Court hath bene likewi≈øe ≈øhaken of late, and the la≈øt yeere it had receiued a ≈øore blow, if it had not bene a≈ø≈øi≈øted and caried by a few voyces; The very name of <hi>Starre-Chamber,</hi> ≈øeemeth to procure a reuerence to the Court.</p>
            <p>I will not play the Criticke to de≈øcant on the name; It hath a name from heauen, a Starre placed in it; and a Starre is a glorious creature, and ≈øeated in a glorious place, next vnto the Angels. The <hi>Starre-Chamber</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo glorious in ≈øub≈øtance: for in the compo≈øition, it is of foure ≈øorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons: The fir≈øt two are Priuie Coun≈øellours and Iudges, the one by wi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in matters of State; the other, by learning in matters of Law, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and order all things both according to Law and State: The other two ≈øorts are Peeres of the Realme, and Bi≈øhops: The Peeres are there by rea≈øon of their greatne≈ø≈øe, to giue authority to that Court: The Bi≈øhops becau≈øe of their learning in Diuinitie, and the intere≈øt they haue in the good gouernment of the Church: And ≈øo, both the learning of both Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and humane Law, and experience and practi≈øe in Gouernment, are conioyned together in the proceedings of this Court.</p>
            <p>There is no Kingdome but hath a Court of Equitie, either by it ≈øelfe, as is heere in <hi>England,</hi> or el≈øe mixed, and incorporate in their Office that are Iudges in the Law, as it is in <hi>Scotland:</hi> But the order of <hi>England</hi> is much more perfect, where they are diuided. And as in ca≈øe of Equitie, where the Law determines not clearely, there the Chancerie doeth determine, hauing Equitie belonging to it, which doeth belong to no other Court: So the <hi>Starre-Chamber</hi> hath that belonging to it, which belongs to no other Court: For in this Court Attempts are puni≈øhable, where other Courts puni≈øh onely facts; And al≈øo where the Law puni≈øheth facts
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:23110:302"/>ea≈øily, as in ca≈øe of Riots or Combates, there the Starre-Chamber puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a higher degree; And al≈øo all combinations of practi≈øes and con≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies; And if the King be di≈øhonoured or contemned in his Prerogatiue, it belongeth mo≈øt properly to the Peeres and Iudges of this Court to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh it: So then this Court being in≈øtituted for ≈øo great cau≈øes, it is great rea≈øon it ≈øhould haue great honour.</p>
            <p>Remember now how I haue taught you brotherly loue one toward another: For you know well, that as you are Iudges, you are all brethren, and your Courts are ≈øi≈øters. I pray you therefore, labour to keepe that ≈øweete harmonie, which is among≈øt tho≈øe ≈øi≈øters the <hi>Mu≈øes.</hi> What greater mi≈øerie can there bee to the Law, then contempt of the Law? and what readier way to contempt, then when que≈øtions come, what ≈øhall bee determined in this Court, and what in that? Whereupon two euils doe ari≈øe; The one, that men come not now to Courts of iu≈øtice, to heare matters of right pleaded, and Decrees giuen accordingly, but onely out of a curio≈øitie, to heare que≈øtions of the Iuri≈ødictions of Courts di≈øpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to ≈øee the euent, what Court is like to preuaile aboue the other; And the other is, that the Pleas are turned from Court to Court in an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe circular motion, as vpon <hi>Ixions</hi> wheele: And this was the rea≈øon why I found iu≈øt fault with that multitude of Prohibitions: For when a poore Mini≈øter had with long labour, and great expence of charge and time, gotten a ≈øentence for his Tithes, then comes a Prohibition, and turnes him round from Court to Court, and ≈øo makes his cau≈øe immortall and endle≈ø≈øe: for by this vncertaintie of Iuri≈ødiction among≈øt Courts, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes are ≈øcourged from Court to Court, and this makes the fruit of Suits like <hi>Tantalus</hi> fruite, ≈øtill neere the Suiters lips, but can neuer come to ta≈øte it. And this in deed is a great delay of Iu≈øtice, and makes cau≈øes end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe: Therefore the onely way to auoyd this, is for you to keepe your owne bounds, and nouri≈øh not the people in contempt of other Courts, but teach them reuerence to Courts in your publique ≈øpeaches, both in your Benches, and in your Circuits; ≈øo ≈øhall you bring them to a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, both of GOD, and of the King.</p>
            <p>Keepe therefore your owne limits towards the King, towards other Courts, and towards other Lawes, bounding your ≈øelues within your owne Law, and make not new Law. Remember, as I ≈øaid before, that you are Iudges, to declare, and not to make Law: For when you make a Decree neuer heard of before, you are Law-giuers, and not Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers.</p>
            <p>I haue laboured to gather ≈øome Articles, like an <hi>Index expurgatorius,</hi> of nouelties new crept into the Law, and I haue it ready to bee con≈øidered of: Looke to <hi>Plowdens</hi> Ca≈øes, and your old <hi>Respon≈øa prudentum;</hi> if you finde it not there, then <hi>(ab initio non fuit ≈øic)</hi> I mu≈øt ≈øay with CHRIST, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the new polygamie, and maintaine the ancient Law pure and vndefiled, as it was before.</p>

            <p>Fir≈øt in generall, that you giue due reuerence to the Law; and this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diuides it ≈øelfe into three.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, not to ≈øue, but vpon iu≈øt cau≈øe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, beeing ≈øued, and Iudgement pa≈ø≈øed again≈øt you, Acquie≈øce in the Iudgement, and doe not tumultuate again≈øt it; and take example from mee, whom you haue heard here prote≈øt, that when euer any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ≈øhall be giuen again≈øt me in my priuate right, betweene me and a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, I will as humbly acquie≈øce as the meane≈øt man in the Land. Imitate me in this, for in euery Plea there are two parties, and Iudgement can be but for one, and again≈øt the other; ≈øo one mu≈øt alwayes be di≈øplea≈øed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, doe not complaine and importune mee again≈øt Iudgements; for I hold this Paradoxe to bee a good rule in Gouernment, that it is better for a King to maintaine an vniu≈øt Decree, then to que≈øtion euery Decree and Iudgement, after the giuing of a ≈øentence, for then Suites ≈øhall neuer haue end: Therefore as you come gaping to the Law for Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice, ≈øo bee ≈øatisfied and contented when Iudgement is pa≈øt again≈øt you, and trouble not mee; but if you finde briberie or corruption, then come boldly: but when I ≈øay boldly, beware of comming to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, except you bee very ≈øure to prooue the iu≈øtice of your cau≈øe: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe looke for <hi>Lex Talionis</hi> to bee executed vpon you; for your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing of an vpright Iudge, de≈øerues double puni≈øhment, in that you ≈øeeke to lay infamie vpon a worthy per≈øon of that reuerent calling.</p>
            <p>And be not tild on with your own Lawyers tales, that ≈øay the cau≈øe is iu≈øt for their owne gaine; but beleeue the Iudges that haue no hire but of me.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in your Pleas, pre≈øume not to meddle with things again≈øt the Kings Prerogatiue, or Honour: Some Gentlemen of late haue beene too bold this wayes; If you v≈øe it, the Iudges will puni≈øh you; and if they ≈øuffer it, I mu≈øt puni≈øh both them and you. Plead not vpon new Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanicall ≈øtraines, that make all things popular; but keepe you within the ancient Limits of Pleas.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, make not many changes from Court to Court: for hee that changeth Courts, ≈øhewes to mi≈øtru≈øt the iu≈øtne≈ø≈øe of the cau≈øe. Goe to the right place, and the Court that is proper for your cau≈øe; change not thence, and ≈øubmit your ≈øelues to the Iudgement giuen there.</p>
            <p>Thus hauing fini≈øhed the Charge to my ≈øelfe, the Iudges and the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:23110:303"/>I am to craue your pardon if I haue forgotten any thing, or beene inforced to breake my Methode; for you mu≈øt remember, I come not hither with a written Sermon: I haue no Bookes to reade it out of, and a long ≈øpeach, manifold bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and a little lea≈øure may well pleade par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for any fault of memorie; and trewly I know not if I haue forgotten any thing or not.</p>
            <p>And now haue I deliuered, Fir≈øt my excu≈øe, why I came not till now: Next, the rea≈øons why I came now: Thirdly, my charge, and that to my ≈øelfe, to you my Lords the Iudges, and to the Auditory.</p>
            <p>I haue al≈øo an ordinary charge that I v≈øe to deliuer to the Iudges before my Councell, when they goe their Circuits; and ≈øeeing I am come to this place, you ≈øhall haue that al≈øo, and ≈øo I will make the old ≈øaying trew, <hi>Combe ≈øeldome, combe≈øore,</hi> I meane by my long deteining you at this time, which will bee ≈øo much the more profitable in this Auditorie; becau≈øe a number of the Auditorie will be informed here, who may relate it to their fellow Iu≈øtices in the countrey.</p>
            <p>My Lords the Iudges, you know very well, that as you are Iudges with mee when you ≈øit here; ≈øo are you Iudges vnder mee, and my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitutes in the Circuits, where you are Iudges Itinerant to doe Iu≈øtice to my people.</p>
            <p>It is an ancient and laudable cu≈øtome in this Kingdome, that the Iudges goe thorow the Kingdome in Circuits, ea≈øing the people thereby of great charges, who mu≈øt otherwi≈øe come from all the remote parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter Hall,</hi> for the finding out and puni≈øhing of offences pa≈øt, and preuenting the occa≈øion or offences that may ari≈øe.</p>
            <p>I can giue you no other charge in effect, but onely to remember you againe of the ≈øame in ≈øub≈øtance which I deliuered to you this time Twelue-moneth.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Remember that when you goe your Circuits, you goe not onely to puni≈øh-and preuent offences, but you are to take care for the good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in generall of the parts where you trauell, as well as to doe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice in particular betwixt party and party, in cau≈øes criminall and ciuill.</p>
            <p>You haue charges to giue to Iu≈øtices of peace, that they doe their dueties when you are ab≈øent, a≈øwell as pre≈øent: Take an accompt of them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their ≈øeruice to me at your returne.</p>
            <p>As none of you will hold it ≈øufficient to giue a charge, except in taking the accompt, you finde the fruit of it: So I ≈øay to you, it will not bee ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for you, to heare my charge, if at your returne you bring not an accompt to the harue≈øt of my ≈øowing, which cannot be done in generall, but in making to me a particular report what you haue done.</p>
            <p>For, a King hath two Offices.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, to direct things to be done:</p>
            <p>Secondly, to take an accompt how they are fulfilled; for what is it the better for me to direct as an Angel, if I take not accompt of your doings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="563" facs="tcp:23110:303"/>I know not whether mi≈øunder≈øtanding, or ≈ølackne≈ø≈øe bred this, that I had no accompt but in generall, of that I gaue you in particular in charge the la≈øt yeere: Therefore I now charge you againe, that at your next returne, you repaire to my Chancellour, and bring your accompts to him in writing, of tho≈øe things which in particular I haue giuen you in charge: And then when I haue ≈øeene your accompts, as occa≈øion ≈øhall ≈øerue, it may bee I will call for ≈øome of you, to be informed of the ≈øtate of that part of the countrey where your Circuit lay.</p>
            <p>Of the≈øe two parts of your ≈øeruice, I know the ordinary Legall part of <hi>Ni≈øi prius</hi> is the more profitable to you: But the other part of Iu≈øtice is more nece≈ø≈øary for my ≈øeruice. Therefore as CHRIST ≈øaid to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øes, <hi>Hoc agite,</hi> as the mo≈øt principall: yet I will ≈øay, <hi>Et illud non omittite:</hi> which, that you may the better doe, I haue allowed you a day more in your Circuits, then my Predece≈ø≈øours haue done.</p>
            <p>And this you ≈øhall finde, that euen as a King, (let him be neuer ≈øo godly, wi≈øe, righteous, and iu≈øt) yet if the ≈øubalterne Magi≈øtrates doe not their parts vnder him, the Kingdome mu≈øt needes ≈øuffer: So let the Iudges bee neuer ≈øo carefull and indu≈øtrious, if the Iu≈øtices of Peace vnder them, put not to their helping hands, in vaine is all your labour: For they are the Kings eyes and eares in the countrey. It was an ancient cu≈øtome, that all the Iudges both immediatly before their going to their Circuits, and immediatly vpon their returne, repaired to the Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> both to receiue what directions it ≈øhould plea≈øe the King by his mouth to giue vnto them; as al≈øo to giue him an accompt of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who was to acquaint the King therewith: And this good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cu≈øtome hath likewi≈øe beene too much ≈ølacked of late; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fir≈øt of all, I am to exhort and command you, that you be carefull to giue a good accompt to me and my Chancellour, of the dueties performed by all Iu≈øtices of Peace in your Circuits: Which gouernment by Iu≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is ≈øo laudable and ≈øo highly e≈øteemed by mee, that I haue made <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to bee gouerned by Iu≈øtices and Con≈øtables, as <hi>England</hi> is. And let not Gentlemen be a≈øhamed of this Place; for it is a place of high Honour, and great reputation, to be made a Mini≈øter of the Kings Iu≈øtice, in ≈øeruice of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Of the≈øe there are two ≈øorts, as there is of all Companies, e≈øpecially where there is a great number; that is, good and bad Iu≈øtices: For the good, you are to enforme me of them, that I may know them, thanke them, and reward them, as occa≈øion ≈øerues: For I hold a good Iu≈øtice of Peace in his Countrey, to doe mee as good ≈øeruice, as hee that waites vpon mee in my Priuie Chamber, and as ready will I be to reward him; For I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt him as capable of any Honour, Office, or preferment about my Per≈øon, or for any place of Councell or State, as well as any Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teour that is neere about mee, or any that haue de≈øerued well of me in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine employments: Yea, I e≈øteeme the ≈øeruice done me by a good Iu≈øtice
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:23110:304"/>of Peace, three hundred miles, yea ≈øixe hundred miles out of my ≈øight, as well as the ≈øeruice done me in my pre≈øence: For as God hath giuen me large limits, ≈øo mu≈øt I be carefull that my prouidence may reach to the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the≈øt parts of them: And as Law cannot be honoured, except Honour be giuen to Iudges: ≈øo without due re≈øpect to Iu≈øtices of Peace, what regard will be had of the ≈øeruice?</p>
            <p>Therefore let none be a≈øhamed of this Office, or be di≈øcouraged in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Iu≈øtice of Peace, if he ≈øerue worthily in it.</p>
            <p>The Chancellour vnder me, makes Iu≈øtices, and puts them out; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I, nor he can tell what they are: Therefore wee mu≈øt bee informed by you Iudges, who can onely tell, who doe well, and who doe ill; without which, how can the good be cheri≈øhed and maintained, and the re≈øt put out? The good Iu≈øtices are carefull to attend the ≈øeruice of the King and countrey, for thanks onely of the King, and loue to their countrey, and for no other re≈øpect.</p>
            <p>The bad are either idle Slowbellies, that abide alwayes at home, giuen to a life of ea≈øe and delight, liker Ladies then men; and thinke it is enough to contemplate Iu≈øtice, when as <hi>Virtus in actione con≈øi≈øtit:</hi> contemplatiue Iu≈øtice is no iu≈øtice, and contemplatiue Iu≈øtices are fit to be put out.</p>
            <p>Another ≈øort of Iu≈øtices are bu≈øie-bodies, and will haue all men dance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their pipe, and follow their greatne≈ø≈øe, or el≈øe will not be content; A ≈øort of men, <hi>Qui ≈øeprimos omnium e≈ø≈øe putant, nec ≈øunt tamen:</hi> the≈øe proud ≈øpirits mu≈øt know, that the countrey is ordained to obey and follow GOD and the King, and not them.</p>
            <p>Another ≈øort are they, that goe ≈øeldome to the Kings ≈øeruice, but when it is to helpe ≈øome of their kindred or alliance; So as when they come, it is to helpe their friends, or hurt their enemies, making Iu≈øtice to ≈øerue for a ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to Faction, and tumultuating the countrey.</p>
            <p>Another ≈øort are Gentlemen of great worth in their owne conceit, and cannot be content with the pre≈øent forme of Gouernement, but mu≈øt haue a kind of libertie in the people, and mu≈øt be gracious Lords, and Redeemers of their libertie; and in euery cau≈øe that concernes Prerogatiue, giue a ≈ønatch again≈øt a Monarchie, through their Puritanicall itching after Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie: Some of them haue ≈øhewed them≈øelues too bold of late in the lower hou≈øe of Parliament: And when all is done, if there were not a King, they would be le≈ø≈øe cared for then other men.</p>
            <p>And now hauing ≈øpoken of the qualities of the Iu≈øtices of Peace; I am next to ≈øpeake of their number. As I euer held the midway in all things to be the way of Vertue, in e≈øchewing both extremities: So doe I in this: for vpon the one part, a multitude of Iu≈øtices of Peace in the countrey more then is nece≈ø≈øary, breeds but confu≈øion: for although it be an old Prouerbe, that <hi>Many handes make light worke;</hi> yet too many make ≈ølight worke; and too great a number of Iu≈øtices of Peace, will make the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to be the more neglected, euery one tru≈øting to another, ≈øo as nothing
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:23110:304"/>≈øhall bee well done; be≈øides the breeding of great corruption: for where there is a great number, it can hardly bee, but ≈øome will bee corrupted. And vpon the other part, too few Iu≈øtices of Peace, will not be able to vndergoe the burthen of the ≈øeruice; And therefore I would neither haue too few, nor too many, but as many in euery countrey, as may, according to the proportion of that countrey, bee nece≈ø≈øary for the performing of the ≈øeruice there, and no more.</p>
            <p>As to the Charge you are to giue to the Iu≈øtices, I can but repeat what formerly I haue told you; yet in ≈øo good a bu≈øine≈ø≈øe,
<q>
                  <hi>Lectio lecta placet, decies repetita placebit.</hi>
               </q> And as I began with fulfilling the Prouerbe, <hi>A Ioue principium;</hi> ≈øo will I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin this Charge you are to giue to the Iu≈øtices with Church-matters: for GOD will ble≈ø≈øe euery good bu≈øine≈ø≈øe the better, that he and his Church haue the precedence. That which I am now to ≈øpeake, is anent Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øants and Papi≈øts. You neuer returned from any Circuit, but by your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt made vnto me, I both conceiued great comfort and great griefe: Comfort, when I heard a number of Recu≈øants in ≈øome Circuits to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øhed: Griefe to my heart and ≈øoule, when I heard a number of Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øants to be in other Circuits increa≈øed.</p>
            <p>I prote≈øt vnto you, nothing in the earth can grieue mee ≈øo much, as mens falling away from Religion in my dayes; And nothing ≈øo much ioyes mee, as when that Religion increa≈øeth vnder mee. GOD is my witne≈ø≈øe, I ≈øpeake nothing for vaine-glory; but ≈øpeake it againe; My heart is grieued when I heare Recu≈øants increa≈øe: Therefore I wi≈øh you Iudges, to take it to heart, as I doe, and preuent it as you can; and make me knowen to my people, as I am.</p>
            <p>There are three ≈øorts of Recu≈øants: The fir≈øt are they that for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues will bee no Recu≈øants, but their wiues and their families are; and they them≈øelues doe come to Church, but once or twice in a yeere, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Law, or for fa≈øhion ≈øake; The≈øe may be formall to the Law, but more fal≈øe to GOD then the other ≈øort.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond ≈øort are they that are Recu≈øants and haue their con≈øcience mi≈ø≈øe-led, and therefore refu≈øe to come to Church, but otherwi≈øe liue as peaceable Subiects.</p>
            <p>The third ≈øort are practi≈øing Recu≈øants: The≈øe force all their ≈øeruants to bee Recu≈øants with them; they will ≈øuffer none of their Tenants, but they mu≈øt bee Recu≈øants; and their neighbours if they liue by them in peace, mu≈øt be Recu≈øants al≈øo.</p>
            <p>The≈øe you may finde out as a foxe by the foule ≈ømell, a great way round about his hole; This is a high pride and pre≈øumption, that they for who≈øe ≈øoules I mu≈øt an≈øwere to GOD, and who enioy their liues and liberties vnder mee, will not onely be Recu≈øants them≈øelues, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and draw others after them.</p>
            <p>As I haue ≈øaid in Parliament hou≈øe, I can loue the per≈øon of a Papi≈øt,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:23110:305"/>being otherwi≈øe a good man and hone≈øtly bred, neuer hauing knowen any other Religion: but the per≈øon of an Apo≈øtate Papi≈øt, I hate. And ≈øurely for tho≈øe Polypragmaticke Papi≈øts, I would you would ≈øtudie out ≈øome ≈øeuere puni≈øhment for them: for they keepe not infection in their owne hearts onely, but al≈øo infect others our good Subiects. And that which I ≈øay for Recu≈øants, the ≈øame I ≈øay for Prie≈øts: I confe≈ø≈øe I am loath to hang a Prie≈øt onely for Religion ≈øake, and ≈øaying Ma≈ø≈øe; but if he refu≈øe the Oath of Alleagiance (which, let the Pope and all the deuils in Hell ≈øay what they will) yet (as you finde by my booke and by diuers others, is meerely Ciuill) tho≈øe that ≈øo refu≈øe the Oath, and are Polyprag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke Recu≈øants; I leaue them to the Law; it is no per≈øecution, but good Iu≈øtice.</p>
            <p>And tho≈øe Prie≈øts al≈øo, that out of my Grace and Mercy haue beene let goe out of pri≈øons, and bani≈øhed, vpon condition not to returne; aske mee no que≈øtions touching the≈øe, quit me of them, and let mee not heare of them: And to them I ioyne tho≈øe that breake pri≈øon; for ≈øuch Prie≈øts as the pri≈øon will not hold, it is a plaine ≈øigne nothing will hold them but a halter: Such are no Martyrs that refu≈øe to ≈øuffer for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience. <hi>Paul,</hi> notwith≈øtanding the doores were open, would not come foorth: And <hi>Peter</hi> came not out of the pri≈øon till led by the Angel of God: But the≈øe will goe forth though with the angel of the Diuell.</p>
            <p>I haue giuen order to my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>London</hi> for the di≈øtinction, &amp;c. of the degrees of Prie≈øts; and when I haue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt from them, then will I giue you another charge concerning them.</p>
            <p>Another thing that offendeth the Realme, is abundance of Ale-hou≈øes; and therefore to auoyd the giuing occa≈øion of euill, and to take away the root, and puni≈øh the example of vice, I would haue the infamous Ale hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes pulled downe, and a command to all Iu≈øtices of Peace that this be done.</p>
            <p>I may complaine of Ale-hou≈øes, for receipt of Stealers of my Deere; but the countrey may complaine for ≈øtealing their hor≈øes, oxen, and ≈øheepe; for murder, cutting of pur≈øes, and ≈øuch like offences; for the≈øe are their haunts. Deuouring bea≈øts, as Lyons and Beares, will not bee where they haue no dennes nor couert; So there would be no theeues, if they had not their receipts, and the≈øe Ale-hou≈øes as their dennes.</p>
            <p>Another ≈øort, are a kinde of Alehou≈øes, which are hou≈øes of haunt and receipt for debau≈øhed rogues and vagabonds, and idle ≈øturdie fellowes; and the≈øe are not properly Ale-hou≈øes, but ba≈øe victuallers, ≈øuch as haue nothing el≈øe to liue by, but keeping hou≈øes of receipt for ≈øuch kinde of cu≈øtomers. I haue di≈øcouered a ≈øtrange packe of late, That within tenne or twelue miles of <hi>London,</hi> there are ten or twelue per≈øons that liue in ≈øpight of mee, going with Pi≈øtols, and walking vp and downe from har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to harbour killing my Deere, and ≈øo ≈øhift from hold to hold, that they cannot be apprehended.</p>
            <p>For Rogues, you haue many good Acts of Parliament: <hi>Edward</hi> the ≈øixt,
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:23110:305"/>though hee were a child, yet for this, he in his time gaue better order then many Kings did in their aage: You mu≈øt take order for the≈øe Beggars and Rogues; for they ≈øo ≈øwarme in euery place, that a man cannot goe in the ≈øtreetes, nor in the high wayes, norany where for them.</p>
            <p>Looke to your hou≈øes of Correction, and remember that in the chiefe Iu≈øtice <hi>Pophams</hi> time, there was not a wandering begger to bee found in all <hi>Somer≈øet≈øhire,</hi> being his natiue countrey.</p>
            <p>Haue a care al≈øo to ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe the building of Cottages vpon Commons, which are as bad as Alehou≈øes, and the dwellers in them doe commonly ≈øteale Deere, Conies, ≈øheepe, oxen, hor≈øes; breake hou≈øes, and doe all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of villanies. It is trew, ≈øome ill Iu≈øtices make gaine of the≈øe ba≈øe things: take an accompt of the Iu≈øtices of Peace, that they may know they doe the≈øe things again≈øt the will of the King.</p>
            <p>I am likewi≈øe to commend vnto you a thing very nece≈ø≈øarie, High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and Bridges; becau≈øe no Common-weale can bee without pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage: I prote≈øt, that as my heart doeth ioy in the erection of Schooles and Ho≈øpitals, which haue beene more in my time, then in many aages of my predece≈ø≈øours; ≈øo it grieues mee, and it is wonderfull to ≈øee the decay of charitie in this; how ≈øcant men are in contributing towards the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of High-wayes and Bridges: Therefore take a care of this, for that is done to day with a penie, that will not bee done hereafter with an hundred pounds, and that will be mended now in a day, which hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will not be mended in a yeere; and that in a yeere, which will not bee done in our time, as we may ≈øee by <hi>Pauls</hi> Steeple.</p>
            <p>Another thing to be cared for, is, the new Buildings here about the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>London;</hi> concerning which my Proclamations haue gone foorth, and by the chiefe Iu≈øtice here, and his Predece≈ø≈øor <hi>Popham,</hi> it hath bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolued to be a generall nu≈øans to the whole Kingdome: And this is that, which is like the Spleene in the body, which in mea≈øure as it ouergrowes, the body wa≈øtes. For is it po≈ø≈øible but the Countrey mu≈øt dimini≈øh, if <hi>London</hi> doe ≈øo increa≈øe, and all ≈øorts of people doe come to <hi>London?</hi> and where doeth this increa≈øe appeare? not in the heart of the Citie, but in the ≈øuburbes; not giuing wealth or profit to the Citie, but bringing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerie and ≈øurcharge both to Citie and Court; cau≈øing dearth and ≈øcar≈øitie through the great proui≈øion of victuals and fewel, that mu≈øt be for ≈øuch a multitude of people: And the≈øe buildings ≈øerue likewi≈øe to harbour the wor≈øt ≈øort of people, as Alehou≈øes and Cottages doe. I remember, that before Chri≈øtmas was Twelue-moneth I made a Proclamation for this cau≈øe, That all Gentlemen of qualitie ≈øhould depart to their owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys and hou≈øes, to maintaine Ho≈øpitalitie among≈øt their neighbours; which was equiuocally taken by ≈øome, as that it was meant onely for that Chri≈øtmas: But my will and meaning was, and here I declare that my meaning was, that it ≈øhould alwayes continue.</p>
            <p>One of the greate≈øt cau≈øes of all Gentlemens de≈øire, that haue no calling
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:23110:306"/>or errand, to dwell in <hi>London,</hi> is apparently the pride of the women: For if they bee wiues, then their husbands; and if they be maydes, then their fathers mu≈øt bring them vp to <hi>London;</hi> becau≈øe the new fa≈øhion is to bee had no where but in <hi>London:</hi> and here, if they be vnmarried, they marre their marriages, and if they be married, they loo≈øe their reputations, and rob their husbands pur≈øes. It is the fa≈øhion of <hi>Italy,</hi> e≈øpecially of <hi>Naples,</hi> (which is one of the riche≈øt parts of it) that all the Gentry dwell in the principall Townes, and ≈øo the whole countrey is emptie: Euen ≈øo now in <hi>England,</hi> all the countrey is gotten into <hi>London;</hi> ≈øo as with time, <hi>England</hi> will onely be <hi>London,</hi> and the whole countrey be left wa≈øte: For as wee now doe imitate the French fa≈øhion, in fa≈øhion of Clothes, and Lackeys to follow euery man; So haue wee got vp the Italian fa≈øhion, in liuing mi≈øerably in our hou≈øes, and dwelling all in the Citie: but let vs in Gods Name leaue the≈øe idle forreine toyes, and keepe the old fa≈øhion of <hi>England:</hi> For it was wont to be the honour and reputation of the Engli≈øh Nobilitie and Gentry, to liue in the countrey, and keepe ho≈øpitalitie; for which we were famous aboue all the countreys in the world; which wee may the better doe, hauing a ≈øoile abundantly fertile to liue in.</p>
            <p>And now out of my owne mouth I declare vnto you, (which being in this place, is equall to a Proclamation, which I intend likewi≈øe ≈øhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hereafter to haue publikely proclaimed,) that the Courtiers, Citizens, and Lawyers, and tho≈øe that belong vnto them, and others as haue Pleas in Terme time, are onely nece≈ø≈øary per≈øons to remaine about this Citie; others mu≈øt get them into the Countrey; For be≈øide the hauing of the countrey de≈øolate, when the Gentrie dwell thus in <hi>London,</hi> diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mi≈øchiefes ari≈øe vpon it: Fir≈øt, if in≈øurrections ≈øhould fall out (as was lately ≈øeene by the Leuellers gathering together) what order can bee taken with it, when the countrey is vnfurni≈øhed of Gentlemen to take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with it? Next, the poore want reliefe for fault of the Gentlemens ho≈øpitalitie at home: Thirdly, my ≈øeruice is neglected, and the good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the countrey for lacke of the principall Gentlemens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, that ≈øhould performe it: And la≈øtly, the Gentlemen lo≈øe their owne thrift, for lacke of their owne pre≈øence, in ≈øeeing to their owne bu≈øine≈ø≈øe at home. Therefore as euery fi≈øh liues in his owne place, ≈øome in the fre≈øh, ≈øome in the ≈øalt, ≈øome in the mud: ≈øo let euery one liue in his owne place, ≈øome at Court, ≈øome in the Citie, ≈øome in the Countrey; ≈øpecially at Fe≈øtiuall times, as Chri≈øtmas and Ea≈øter, and the re≈øt.</p>
            <p>And for the decrea≈øe of new Buildings heere, I would haue the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders re≈øtrained, and committed to pri≈øon; and if the builders cannot be found, then the workemen to be impri≈øoned; and not this onely, but likewi≈øe the buildings to bee ca≈øt downe; I meane ≈øuch buildings as may be ouerthrowen without inconuenience, and therefore that to be done by order and direction.</p>
            <p>There may be many other abu≈øes that I know not of; take you care my
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:23110:306"/>Lords the Iudges of the≈øe, and of all other; for it is your part to looke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. I heare ≈øay, robbery begins to abound more then heretofore, and that ≈øome of you are too mercifull; I pray you remember, that mercy is the Kings, not yours, and you are to doe Iu≈øtice where trew cau≈øe is: And take this for a rule of Policie, That what vice mo≈øt abounds in a Common-wealth, that mu≈øt be mo≈øt ≈øeuerely puni≈øhed, for that is trew gouernment.</p>
            <p>And now I will conclude my Speach with GOD, as I began. Fir≈øt, that in all your behauiours, a≈øwell in your Circuits as in your Benches, you giue due reuerence to GOD, I meane, let not the Church nor Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men bee di≈øgraced in your Charges, nor Papi≈øts nor Puritanes counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced: Countenance and encourage the good Church-men, and teach the people by your example to reuerence them: for, if they be good, they are worthy of double honour for their Office ≈øake; if they be faultie, it is not your place to admoni≈øh them; they haue another <hi>Forum</hi> to an≈øwere to for their misbehauiour.</p>
            <p>Next, procure reuerence to the King and the Law, enforme my people trewly of mee, how zealous I am for Religion, how I de≈øire Law may bee maintained and flouri≈øh; that euery Court ≈øhould haue his owne Iuri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; that euery Subiect ≈øhould ≈øubmit him≈øelfe to Law; So may you liue a happie people vnder a iu≈øt KING, freely enioying the fruite of PEACE and IVSTICE, as ≈øuch a people ≈øhould doe.</p>
            <p>Now I confe≈ø≈øe, it is but a <hi>Tandem aliquando,</hi> as they ≈øay in the Schooles, that I am come hither: Yet though this bee the fir≈øt, it ≈øhall not, with the grace of GOD, bee the la≈øt time of my comming, now my choice is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; for hauing once bene here, a meaner occa≈øion may bring mee againe: And I hope I haue euer caried my ≈øelfe ≈øo, and by GODS grace euer will, as none will euer ≈øu≈øpect, that my comming here will be to any partiall end; for I will euer bee carefull in point of Iu≈øtice, to keepe my ≈øelfe vn≈øpotted all the dayes of my life. And vpon this my generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtation, I hope the world will know, that I came hither this day to maintaine the Law, and doe Iu≈øtice according to my Oath.</p>
