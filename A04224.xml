            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:23110:4"/>of your Inheritance, which conſiſts as much in the WORKES of his Royall <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertues,</hi> as in the wealth of his mighty <hi>Kingdomes. Baſilius</hi> wrote <hi>de Jnſtitutione Principis</hi> to his Sonne <hi>Leo; Constantinus</hi> to his Sonne <hi>Romanus; Manuell</hi> to his Sonne <hi>Iohannes;</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, to his Sonne <hi>Philip:</hi> The workes of the three former are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant both in <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine.</hi> His <hi>Maiestie,</hi> after the Example of thoſe <hi>Emperours,</hi> and ſundry other <hi>Kings,</hi> wrote his ΒΑΣΙΛΙΚΟΝ-ΔΩΡΟΝ to <hi>Prince Henry,</hi> your <hi>Highneſſe</hi> moſt worthy <hi>Brother:</hi> His part, by GOD his Prouidence, is falne to your Lot; and who may iuſtly detaine from you the reſt? The rule in Scripture is; that if the firſt fruits be holy, ſo is the whole lumpe; and to whom the firſt was giuen, to him all the reſt was due: To your <hi>Highnes</hi> therefore are theſe offered, as to the trew Heire and Inheritor of them. And that I may make you the better accompt of them; May it pleaſe your <hi>Highneſſe</hi> to vnderſtand, that of theſe <hi>Workes,</hi> ſome were out before; ſome other of them neuer ſaw light before; and others were almoſt loſt and gone, or at leaſt abuſed by falſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, to their owne diſgrace and his <hi>Maieſties</hi> great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour. Now it being the duetie of all <hi>Deanes</hi> in their Churches, <hi>Diſperſa colligere;</hi> I thought it might ſort well with the nature of my place in the <hi>Chappel,</hi> wherein I haue had the Honour ſo many yeeres to ſerue his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> to gather theſe things that were ſcattered, and to bring to light thoſe that too long had lien in darkenes, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue in one body, what might eaſily haue bin loſt in parts. In this <hi>Preſentment,</hi> I muſt humbly craue of your <hi>Highnes,</hi> not to be miſtaken in the trew meaning and maner of it: For theſe <hi>Workes</hi> come not to you, as vſually Bookes doe to men of great <hi>Dignitie,</hi> for <hi>Patronage</hi> and <hi>Protection;</hi> for Protection is properly from iniurie; and that the Royall <hi>Author</hi> of them is beſt able to right: But to you they come partly for preſeruation, and for that the Diſpoſition
<pb facs="tcp:23110:4"/>of Nature hath made you more apt, and more principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a Patterne, and that not vnfitly; ſince the <hi>Samplar</hi> is euer more ancient then the <hi>Exemplification:</hi> And as in the preſeruation, the Sonne hath his aduantage by ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; ſo in the Patterne, the Father by preceding hath his <hi>Prerogatiue.</hi> Let theſe <hi>Workes</hi> therefore, moſt Gracious <hi>Prince,</hi> lie before you as a Patterne; you cannot haue a better: Neither doeth the Honour of a good Sonne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in any thing more, then in immitating the good <hi>Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> of a good <hi>Father;</hi> as we may very well perceiue by the Scripture phraſe, where the vſuall <hi>Encomium</hi> of good <hi>Kings</hi> is, that they walked in the wayes of their Fathers.

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst the infinite number of great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>olumes wherewith the world ſeemes, as it were, to bee wayed downe, there bee few of them that were written at once, or were at first publiſhed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Writings as they conſist of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry natures; ſo they will beare a diuers maner of Edition. To ſet foorth an Art by pieces, is to ſhew you a body diſmembred; the one is no more vncomely, then the other is vnproper. To publiſh a <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> before it be at an end, is to turne the Hower-glaſse before it bee runne out; neither of both will giue you a trew taſte of the time. But writings of other Natures, Common places and Controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Meditations and Commentaries, as they are for the most part, accidentally taken vp, ſo they are as occaſionally ſet out: They craue no other birth into the world, then they had conceptions in our braines, ſingly by vs conceiued, and ſingly by themſelues ſet out.</p>
            <p>The different maner of <hi>GOD</hi> his ſetting foorth of his owne Workes, may inſtruct vs in this point. His diuine Wiſedome held one courſe in his Naturall Workes, an other in his Ceremonialls, Politicalls and Moralls. Jn his Naturalls he made a maſſe at once, which ſpeedily he diuerſified into diuers formes. Hee gaue a kinde of potentiall delineation of all things in that vniuerſall matter, which preſently hee diſtinguiſhed into diuers <hi>Species</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:23110:6"/>perfection: But in his Ceremonialls, hee takes another courſe, he brings not them out of a Maſſe, but into a Maſſe: He doeth not out of a <hi>Totum</hi> produce the parts, but out of the parts make vp the whole. For example; Jn the Ceremonialls, firſt he beginnes with Sacrifice, long after he followes with Circumciſion, then hee filleth a Tabernacle with them; at laſt makes them full vp in a Temple. Jn his Politicalls, hee beginnes with a paternall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in a family, proceeds to an Election of a Captaine in an Armie, as in <hi>Ioſuah</hi> and the Judges, perfects it by way of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion in a ſetled Kingdome, as in <hi>Solomon</hi> and his Succeſſors. Jn his Moralls, hee beginnes with the word out of his owne mouth, proceeds with the <hi>Tables</hi> written by his owne fingers, followes on with the fiue Bookes penned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> till hee make vp the <hi>Canon</hi> perfect by a number of ſucceeding <hi>Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What we haue from <hi>GOD</hi> in a preſident, it may wel beſeeme vs to practiſe; and ſince his Bookes came out ſo farre aſunder, it is no reproach to any man, though his Workes come not foorth together: for there is a reaſon for it in vs anſwerable in ſome proportion to that of the Workes of <hi>GOD,</hi> for workes of Nature haue their roote from within vs, and bring with them a radicall kinde of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that neuer ſuffers them to rest, till they haue produced their fruite to perfect forme and perfection: Workes of deliberation and Art, haue their foundation from without vs, and giue vs occaſion to worke vpon them, as our phantaſies thinke fittest for the preſent time: Hence proceeds it, that the workes of Nature haue ſo few errors in them, thoſe of Art ſo many; They of Nature ſo conſtant, they of Arte ſo variable; they of Nature ſo perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, they of Art ſo ſoone periſh; they of Nature ſo well accepted and approued of all, they of Art accepted or reiected, as it pleaſeth the ſeuerall apprehenſions of men to conceiue of them.</p>
            <p>Now, albeit the workes of men be of Errors ſo full, of nature ſo different, ſubiect to ſo many Jnterpretations, publiſhed at ſo diuers times; Yet hath it bene euer esteemed a matter commendable to collect them together, and incorporate them into one Body, that we may behold at once, what diuers Off-ſprings haue proceeded
<pb facs="tcp:23110:6"/>from one braine, and how various Conceptions the wit of man is able to afford the world. To instance in a few of them beginning a little higher then the writings of ordinarie Men. The ſeruants of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> are commended in Scripture for collecting together the Sentences of <hi>Solomon. Ieſus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Sirach</hi> is praiſed for ſearching out the Copies of his Grandfathers workes: But prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally <hi>Ezra</hi> is had in great honour for ſetting in order the whole Bookes of the Old Teſtament, and deuiding them into Chapters and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſes, which before were caried along in a ſcroule, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall <hi>Series,</hi> without any distinction at all. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> is reported to haue ſearched out the Copies of the three former Euangelists, and to haue added his owne for the fourth in that order, as now they are extant. And the Primitiue Church was curious to gather together the Epistles of the Holy Apostles; which, they being not able by reaſon of perſecution perfectly to performe in euery place, gaue occaſion to after-times, to call the authority of ſo many of them into question.</p>
            <p>But to deſcend; How are we bound to thoſe, who haue laboured in ſetting out the <hi>Counſells,</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> together? Jnſomuch, that we thinke our ſelues as much bound to <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Hierom,</hi> and of later times to <hi>Peter Crab</hi> and <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and diuers others, who haue laboured in that kinde, as wee doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the Authors themſelues. <hi>Traian</hi> commended <hi>Plutark</hi> for gathering the <hi>Apothegmes</hi> of wiſe men together. <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Leo,</hi> collected out of all Histories, both in the Eaſt and West, one <hi>Corpus Hiſtoricum,</hi> which they counted an inestimable Treaſure. <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> by the helpe of <hi>Tribonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> did the like in the Lawes. <hi>Gratian</hi> compiled the Decrees out of the Epistles of <hi>Popes, Councells</hi> and <hi>Fathers. Damaſcen</hi> collected into one body of Diuinitie, the Sentences of the Greeke <hi>Fathers;</hi> And <hi>Peter Lumbard 400.</hi> yeeres after him by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample did the like in the Latine <hi>Fathers.</hi> And how doe wee labour to recouer Bookes that are lost? The Bookes of <hi>Origen</hi> that amounted to ſixe thouſand, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> witneſseth, were much laboured for by <hi>Euſebius</hi> and others. The Bookes of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero
<pb facs="tcp:23110:7"/>de Repub.</hi> were much ſought for by Cardinall <hi>Poole;</hi> and great ſummes of money haue bene ſpent to recouer the loſt <hi>Decades</hi> of <hi>Liuie.</hi> Wherefore ſince it hath beene heretofore the practiſe of all aages, to collect the workes of Men of worth, and preſerue them from periſhing; to labour much in recouering thoſe that haue bene loſt; to giue to euery childe the owne Father; to euery Booke the trew Author: (for there neuer had bene halfe ſo many birds to haue flowen about the world with falſe feathers, if euery Author had ſet out his owne workes together in his owne time,) J hope then it ſhall not be now a matter of reproofe in a Seruant, to trauaile in the ſetting foorth of the <hi>Works</hi> of his Maſter; and for giuing you that together, which before yee could hardly get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder; and for preſeruing that in a Maſſe from periſhing, that might eaſily be loſt in a Mite.</p>
            <p>But while I am collecting workes one way, I heare others ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering wordes as faſt an other way, affirming, it had beene better his Maieſtie had neuer written any Bookes at all; and being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, better they had periſhed with the preſent, like <hi>Proclamations,</hi> then haue remayned to <hi>Poſterity:</hi> For ſay theſe Men, Little it befitts the Maieſty of a <hi>King</hi> to turne Clerke, and to make a warre with the penne, that were fitter to be fought with the Pike; to ſpend the powers of his ſo exquiſite an vnderſtanding vpon pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which had they beene ſpent on powder, could not but haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled ere this, for the Conqueſt of a <hi>Kingdome.</hi> For a <hi>King,</hi> ſay they, to enter a Controuerſie with a Scholler, is, as if he ſhould fight a Combate with a Kerne; he doth no more deſcend from his Honour in the one, then he bringes vpon himſelfe Diſgrace by the other. And ſince that Booke-writing is growen into a Trade; It is as diſhonorable for a <hi>King</hi> to write bookes; as it is for him to be a Practitioner in a <hi>Profeſſion.</hi> Jf a <hi>King</hi> will needs write; Let him write like a <hi>King,</hi> euery Lyne a <hi>Law,</hi> euery Word a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,</hi> euery Letter a <hi>Mandate.</hi> Jn good trewth, I haue had my eares ſo oft dung through with theſe Obiections and the like, as I know not whether I conceiued amiſse of my ſelfe or no, thinking I had more ability to anſwere theſe Calumnyes, then I had patience
<pb facs="tcp:23110:7"/>to heare them: And therefore hauing ſo fit opportunity, J ſhall not let to deliuer my opinion; <hi>Whether it may ſorte with the Maieſtie of a King, to be a writer of Bookes, or no.</hi> First I could neuer reade, that there was any Law against it; and where we haue no Law, the best is to follow good Examples: And many Diuines are of opinion, that examples that are not contrary to any Precept, doe binde vs in practiſe, at least ſo farre; that though they doe not inforce vs to the doing, yet they warrant the deede when it is done; And if Examples will ſerue the turne, wee haue Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples enough.</p>
            <p>First to beginne with the <hi>King of Kings</hi> God himſelfe, who as he doth all things for our good; So doeth he many things for our Jmitation. Jt pleaſed his Diuine wiſedome to bee the firſt in this Rancke, that we read of, that did euer write. Hee wrote, and the writing was the writing, ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> of God; the maner was after the maner of engrauing; the matter was in Stone cut into two Tables, and the Tables were the worke of God written on both ſides. <hi>Diuines</hi> hold, that the Heart is the principall Seate of the Soule; which Soule of ours is the immediate worke of God, as theſe Tables were the immediate worke of his owne fingers. The Stone, the expreſſe repreſent of the hardneſse of our heart; the engrauing the worke of God ſo deepely impreſsed, that it can neuer be blotted out; the writing, the writing of the Law in our hearts; In two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, for our double duty to God and Man; on both ſides to take vp our heart ſo wholly, that nothing contrary to thoſe Precepts ſhould euer haue any place in our Soules. And certainely from this little <hi>Library,</hi> that God hath erected within vs, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all our Learning layd; So that people Ciuillized doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themſelues depriued of one of the beſt abilities of nature, if they be not ſomewhat inabled by writing, to expreſſe their mindes: And there is no Nation ſo brutiſh or Barbarous, that haue not inuented one kinde of Character or other, whereby to conuey to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers their inward Conceptions. From theſe Tables of God, wee may come to the writing of our Bleſſed <hi>Sauiour,</hi> which we may put in the next place, though not for order yet for Honour. His Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
<pb facs="tcp:23110:8"/>Maiestie left behinde him no Monument of writing, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by his owne hand in any externall Booke; for he was to induce and bring in an other maner of the writing of the Law of Loue; not in Tables of ſtone; written not with incke and paper, but in the Tables of our fleſhly hearts written by the Spirit of the Liuing God: Yet did he once with his owne finger, write on the Pauement of the Temple of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> What he writ, J will not now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe. <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> ſaith he wrote this Sentence: <hi>Feſtucam in oculo fratris cernis, trabem in tuo non vides. Beda</hi> thinkes, he wrote that Sentence that he ſpake: <hi>He that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne, let him caſt the firſt ſtone at her. Haymo</hi> hath a pretty Conceit: He thinketh, he wrote certaine Characters in the Pauement, which the Accuſers beholding might ſee, as in a glaſſe, their owne wickedneſſe; and ſo bluſhing at it went their wayes. What euer it was, ſure we are, our <hi>Sauiour</hi> would haue falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations written in dust, to bee troden vnder foote of them that paſse by. But howſoeuer, I ſay, our Bleſsed <hi>Sauiour</hi> did leaue behind him no writing of his owne hand; Yet we may not deny, but that God in the old <hi>Teſtament</hi> and our <hi>Sauiour</hi> in the New, haue left vs many bookes of their owne inditements: For all the Bookes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture were written by inſpiration; and the Prophets and Apoſtles were but their <hi>Amanuenſes,</hi> and writ onely as they were led and actuated by the Spirit of God: So that we may not make the Author of any of thoſe Bookes any other then God Himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The old world before the flood wil afford vs no writings, neither did that aage require them; for the liues of Men of that aage were liuing <hi>Libraries,</hi> and laſted longer then the labors of Men doe in this aage: Yet <hi>S. Iude</hi> doeth inſinuate ſomewhat of the writings of <hi>Enoch,</hi> who though he were not in Stile a <hi>King,</hi> Yet there is no reaſon to contend with him for that Title; for his Dominion would beare it, ſtanding Heire-Apparent to the greater part of the world. <hi>Origen, Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> report many things out of the ſuppoſititous writings that went vnder his name: And <hi>Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> and that <hi>Beroſus,</hi> that wee haue, tell vs, that hee erected
<pb facs="tcp:23110:8"/>two pillars, the one of Stone, the other of Bricke, wherein he wrote of the two-fold destructions of the world, the one by Water, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Fire: But howſoeuer that be trew, it is very probable, he wrote ſomething of that matter, which though it periſhed with that world; yet doubtleſſe the memory thereof was preſerued by Tradition vnto the dayes of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>J will not here inſist vpon the writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was not onely a Prieſt, and a Prophet, but was, as himſelfe records, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the people a <hi>King,</hi> and was the firſt that euer receiued au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie from <hi>GOD</hi> to write in <hi>Diuinitie:</hi> Neither will J inſiſt vpon the Example of <hi>King Dauid,</hi> in whoſe <hi>Pſalmes</hi> and <hi>Himnes,</hi> are reſounded out the praiſes of <hi>GOD</hi> in all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; for that J finde nothing that theſe men writ, but what they writ as the <hi>Scribes</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> acted, as I ſaid euen now, by <hi>GOD</hi> his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and not guided by their owne. Yet I ſuppoſe wee may ſafely collect thus much from them, that if <hi>GOD</hi> had thought it a matter derogatory to the Maieſtie of a <hi>King</hi> to bee a Writer, he would not haue made choice of thoſe, as his chiefe <hi>Inſtruments</hi> in this kinde, who were principalls in that other Order. J would eaſily beleeue, that ſuch men as haue had the honour to be <hi>GOD</hi> his <hi>Pen-men,</hi> ſhould neuer vouchſafe to write any thing of their owne: for as we hold in a pious opinion, that the bleſſed <hi>Virgine,</hi> hauing once conceiued by the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> would neuer after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by man; So ſurely men, that had deliuered nothing but the conceptions of that Spirit, ſhould hardly be drawne euer to ſet out any of their owne labours. But we ſee the flat contrary both in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> the one the greateſt Iudge, the other the moſt glorious <hi>King,</hi> that euer that Kingdome had. <hi>Samuel,</hi> who writ by <hi>GODS</hi> appointment, the greateſt part of thoſe two Bookes, that beare his name, writ alſo by his owne accord, a Booke contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Law of a <hi>King,</hi> or Inſtitution of a <hi>Prince,</hi> whereby hee laboured to keepe the <hi>King</hi> as well from declining to Tyrannie, as the people from running into Libertie. <hi>Solomon,</hi> beſides the Bookes of Scripture, which remaine, writ many likewiſe of his owne accord, which are loſt: For to ſay nothing of his <hi>3000. Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:23110:9"/>his <hi>5000.</hi> Songes, that <hi>ingens opus,</hi> as the <hi>Hebrues</hi> call it, of the nature of all things, Birds and Beaſts, Fowles and fiſhes, Trees and plants, from the Hyſop to the Cedar: All theſe were rather workes to manifest humane wiſedome, then Diuine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; written rather for the recreation of his owne ſpirit, then for the edification of the Church: For I cannot conceiue, but thoſe Bookes would rather haue taught vs the learning of Nature; (for which <hi>GOD</hi> hath left vs to the writings of men) then edified vs in the gifts of Grace; for which hee hath giuen vs his owne Booke. Neither let any man ſuggest, that theſe writings, that are lost, and, as they ſay, were destroyed in the destruction of the Temple by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> were of the ſame authoritie, as thoſe that doe remaine: for J can hardly be induced to beleeue, that the writings, that were indited by the Spirit of <hi>GOD,</hi> layed vp in the <hi>Arke,</hi> receiued into the <hi>Canon,</hi> read publikely in the Church, are vtterly periſhed. Jt is a deſperate thing to call, either the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of <hi>GOD,</hi> or the fidelity of the Church in queſtion in this point: For if thoſe, that haue bene, are periſhed; then, why may not theſe that remaine as well be loſt? which is contrary to our <hi>Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours</hi> aſſertion, that one <hi>Iota</hi> ſhall not periſh till all bee fulfilled: Therefore J rather incline to thinke; that what euer was Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſtill is, then that any is loſt: Neither is this opinion ſo curious to hold, as the other is dangerous to beleeue; Better it is euer, to argue our ſelues of ignorance, then to accuſe <hi>GOD</hi> of improuidence: But if ſo much Scripture be loſt, as is alleadged, farewell <hi>GOD</hi> his prouidence, farewell the fidelitie of the Church, to whoſe care was concredited the <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>GOD.</hi> Let vs come to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Kings,</hi> where we ſhall not incurre any danger of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie; that were ſo farre from being acted by <hi>GOD</hi> his <hi>Spirit;</hi> that they were more like thoſe Diſciples of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that had not heard whether there were an <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> or no; that knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>GOD,</hi> though they felt neuer ſo much of his Goodneſſe; that neuer beleeued his Omnipotencie, though they had neuer ſo much experience of his Power.</p>
            <p>To beginne with the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> whoſe firſt Monarch was
<pb facs="tcp:23110:9"/>
               <hi>Nimrod,</hi> and his chiefe Citie <hi>Babel:</hi> from his time to <hi>Sardana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palus</hi> the last of that Monarchie, there was no <hi>King</hi> amongst them, that gaue himſelfe to Letters: for as their Kingdome was founded in Tyrannie, ſo they laboured to keepe it in Barbaritie; neither must we euer looke to ſee Learning flouriſh, where Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie beareth the Standerd; for Learning hath no more a facultie to bring the minde to vnderstanding, then it hath with it a power, that workes the will to libertie; neither of which, can euer conſist with Tyrannie: And therefore it is no wonder, that this aage affoorded no learned <hi>Kings:</hi> for in that State, which continued thirteene or foureteene hundred yeeres, yee can ſcarce reade of a learned man: Therefore let either <hi>Hiſtories</hi> or <hi>Poets</hi> paint that out for a Golden aage, as they pleaſe, there was neuer any aage, that hath left ſo little memory of the Golden tincture of their Witts.</p>
            <p>After the time of <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Phull, Tig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lath-Philaſar</hi> and <hi>Salmanaſar,</hi> of whom mention is made in Scripture, and to whom, as it is thought, <hi>Ionas</hi> preached, and with whom ſome of the <hi>Prophets</hi> were conuerſant, when as theſe <hi>Kings</hi> came into the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as they did in the dayes of <hi>Menahem,</hi> who gaue to <hi>Phul-Belochus</hi> a thouſand Talents of Siluer for a Tribute; And in the dayes of <hi>Hezechiah</hi> came <hi>Salmanaſar</hi> and beſieged <hi>Samaria</hi> three yeeres, and caried away a great part of the people of the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> From that time forward, their <hi>Kings</hi> gaue themſelues to Letters; inſomuch as in the dayes of <hi>Nabucodonolor,</hi> who ſet vp the Monarchy of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> within one hundred yeeres of <hi>Salmanaſar King</hi> of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> learning was in great estimation, and the <hi>Kings</hi> Court was a Schoole for the best witts of the Kingdome to be bred in, that they might bee able to ſtand before the <hi>King</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all learning and vnderstanding. And if <hi>Stories</hi> do not intollerably deceiue vs; <hi>Daniel</hi> and his companions inſtructed fiue great Monarches, as in the trew knowledge of <hi>GOD,</hi> ſo in the vnderstanding of all excellent Arts and Sciences; Namely <hi>Nabuchodonoſor, Euilmerodack, Baltazar, Darius</hi> of the
<pb facs="tcp:23110:10"/>
               <hi>Medes,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> of the <hi>Perſians:</hi> And it were no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to proue the trewth of this out of <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Come to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who conuerſed more with the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as with <hi>Ezra, Nehemiah, Zachary, Malachy</hi> and the people that were in captiuitie; we ſhall finde them giuen much to Letters. <hi>Cyrus</hi> the firſt Monarch is recorded to haue written large <hi>Commentaries</hi> of all his diurnall Actions: amongst thoſe Books are found, ſaith <hi>Eſdras,</hi> the <hi>Edicts</hi> of reducing of the <hi>Iewes</hi> to their Countrey: He wrote diuers Letters for the ſame purpoſe to all the chiefe Cities of <hi>Aſia;</hi> ſome whereof, we haue in the <hi>11.</hi> of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi> Chap. the first. Many things likewiſe are reported to haue bene written of <hi>Artaxerxes, Darius,</hi> and ſome others of thoſe Monarches, as wee may partly conceiue by the <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Bookes of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and more by the Apocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal-<hi>Eſdras,</hi> who reports it to haue bene a cuſtome of thoſe <hi>Kings,</hi> ſo much to delight in learning, and in the ſayings of wiſe men, that they vſed for an exerciſe in their greateſt Solemnities, to haue ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne <hi>Orations</hi> made in the preſence of the <hi>King</hi> and State, of ſundry purpoſes, which, whoſo performed to the liking of the <hi>King,</hi> was rewarded with the higheſt Preferments, that ſo mighty a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch could aduance them vnto.</p>
            <p>Come we to the <hi>Graecians;</hi> and there we ſhall finde Learning in the Tropicke of <hi>Cancer</hi> at ſuch a height, as it neuer was before, nor euer, that we read of, ſince. And ſurely it is worth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing, that when that extarordinary Diuine Light went out, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Learning came in; and the ende of the <hi>Prophets</hi> was the beginning of the <hi>Poets:</hi> The last of the diuinity of the one, the firſt of the Philoſophy of the other: for from the end of the Captiuity till the Comming of our <hi>Sauiour Chriſt,</hi> the ſpace of foure hundreth yeares and more, in which there was no Prophet, that euer J reade of, there were ſo many <hi>Orators, Poets</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of ſuch ſingular giftes in all kindes; as wee are onely their Schollers ſince, and can neuer attaine to the Excellency of our Master. Jn this time <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great was as famous for his Learning and writings, as he was for his Victories: He wrote to <hi>Antipater</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:23110:10"/>of all his owne Actions in <hi>Aſia</hi> and in <hi>India,</hi> as <hi>Plutark</hi> reports in his Life. <hi>S. Ciprian</hi> in his Tractate of the vanitie of Jdoles, ſaith, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great wrote <hi>Inſigne Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> to his Mother; wherein he ſignifies vnto her, how it was tolde him by a certaine <hi>Egyptian-Prieſt,</hi> that all the Gods of the Gentiles had bene but men. And <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> alſo in his twelft Booke <hi>De ciuitate Dei</hi> makes mention of other of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Alexander</hi> to <hi>Olimpias</hi> his Mother about the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Monarchies.</p>
            <p>Amongst the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Syria, Antiochus</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> writ many Bookes, and ſent them into <hi>Iudea,</hi> about changing the Rites and Ceremonies of the <hi>Iewes</hi> into the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Grecians;</hi> The principall heades of his Bookes may be found in the Bookes of <hi>Machabes</hi> and in <hi>Ioſephus.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> which of their <hi>Emperours</hi> did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance his fame by Letters? <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> beſides many other things, writ his <hi>Commentaries</hi> after the example of <hi>Cyrus. Octauius,</hi> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> reportes, writ many <hi>Volumes, The hiſtorie of his owne life, Exhortations to Philoſophie, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Verſes, Epigrams, Tragedies</hi> and diuers other things; of whom I will only relate two <hi>Stories</hi> not impertinent to my purpoſe. He is reported to haue bene a very diligent ſearcher out of all ſuch Bookes, as appertayned to the <hi>Roman-Ethnick-Religion.</hi> All the Bookes <hi>Fatidicorum,</hi> of <hi>Fortune-tellers,</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not from approued Authors both of <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> he caſt in the fire, to the number of two thouſand: Onely he reſerued the writings of the <hi>Sibills,</hi> but with that choiſe, as hee burnt all ſuch of them as he thought to bee counterfeit. J relate this <hi>Story</hi> the rather, for that J thinke it were a good Preſident for our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> to follow, to make a diligent ſearch of all good and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Authors; As for all Hereticall <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> ſlaunderous Libells and impertinent writings, to commit them to <hi>Vulcane:</hi> for one of the maine meanes of corrupting this people in point of <hi>Religion,</hi> proceeds from the free vſe of reading of all kinde of writings without any reſtraint.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:23110:11"/>The other <hi>Storie</hi> of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> is that famous <hi>Inſcription</hi> of his, which he made to be ſet vp in the <hi>Altar</hi> of the <hi>Capitoll</hi> to our <hi>Sauiour Chriſt;</hi> of which <hi>Nicephorus</hi> makes mention; as alſo <hi>Suidas</hi> in the word <hi>Auguſtus.

            </p>
            <p>Therefore ſince wee are compaſsed about with ſuch a Clowd of <hi>Witneſſes</hi> (albeit theſe are but a little handfull in compariſon of the infinite multitude, that might be produced,) Since we haue the examples of all the Mightie-men of the <hi>World,</hi> euen from the beginning thereof vnto this day; who haue ſtriuen as much to get a Name for their writings, as fame for their doings; haue affected as much to be counted Learned as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictorious; and to be reputed of, as much for their wiſe Sayings, as for their worthy Deeds; Why ſhould it bee thought a thing ſtrange in this time, that his <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,</hi> whom <hi>GOD</hi> hath adorned with as many rare perfections of Nature and Arte, as euer he did any that wee read of, (I except ſuch as were Diuinely inſpired) ſhould lend the world a few leaues out of the large <hi>Volumes</hi> of his <hi>Learning?</hi> J commend the wiſedome of our Aduerſaries, who hauing aſsayed all meanes, the wit of man is able to inuent, to incline his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> to like of their partie; and finding by all their Tricks, they haue got no ground, would at last put his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> to ſilence, and gaine thus much of him, at least; that ſince he will doe nothing for them; yet that he would ſay nothing against them. Therefore they cry out against his <hi>Maieſties</hi> writing, and vpbrayd him more for that hee doeth write, then they doe for any thing that hee hath written: Jt is ynough to wonder at, that <hi>Rex ſcribit.</hi> Theſe people are wiſe in
<pb facs="tcp:23110:13"/>their generation, and haue learned by long experience; that as the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>CHRIST</hi> is the Goſpel of peace, ſo it hath bene from the beginning ſpread more by the Pennes of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> then by the power of <hi>Princes;</hi> more propagated by the ſweet writings of the ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> then it could bee ſuppreſſed by the ſeuere Edicts of <hi>Emperours;</hi> and of late, their Kingdome hath bene more ſhaken by a poore Monke, then it hath bene able to recouer by the helpe of Mighty <hi>Monarches.</hi> Therefore ſince the writings of poore Schollers haue ſo raiſed the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and ſo diſcouered the <hi>Myſterie</hi> of Jniquitie; they do well to feare what may follow vpon the Writings of ſo great a <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They liue ſecurely from bleeding by his <hi>Maieſties</hi> Sword; but they are not ſafe from being blaſted by the breath of his <hi>Maieſties</hi> Bookes. Jf they could bring it about therefore, to calme and quiet his <hi>Maieſties</hi> Spirit from working vpon them that way; as they ſee his <hi>Maieſties</hi> ſweetneſſe to bee farre from drawing of their bloods the other way, they would deeme it a greater Conquest, then all the conuerſions of the <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> they tell vs ſo many tales of: For they looke vpon his <hi>Maieſties</hi> Bookes, as men looke vpon <hi>Blaſing-Starres,</hi> with amazement, fearing they portend ſome ſtrange thing, and bring with them a certaine Influence to worke great change and alteration in the world: Neither is their expectation herein deceiued; for we haue ſeene with our eyes, the Operation of his <hi>Maieſties Workes</hi> in the Conſciences of their men ſo farre, as from their highest <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claue</hi> to their lowest <hi>Cells,</hi> there haue bene, that haue bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted by them; and that in ſuch number, as wee want rather meanes to maintaine them, then they minds to come to vs. But to conclude this point, that <hi>Kings</hi> may write; Giue mee leaue to offer you this Meditation.</p>
            <p>How many are the wayes that men doe inuent to perpetuate their Memorie! Inſomuch, that mortall-men haue made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues Gods, when they were dead, that they might be adored, as if they were aliue. Wherein, is the <hi>Impetus</hi> of Nature ſo ſtrong,
<pb facs="tcp:23110:13"/>as in the affection that propogates to <hi>Poſteritie?</hi> Wherefore ſerue Pictures, but to continue our features? Why doe men bestow ſo much cost in ſumptuous Buildings, but to leaue a <hi>Monument</hi> of their Magnificence? To what end doe we erect Holy-houſes and Hoſpitalls, but to poſſeſſe mens mindes with the Deuotion of our Soules? And ſhall wee bleſse a <hi>King,</hi> when wee behold him in his <hi>Poſteritie!</hi> Shall wee admire his features, when wee contemplate them in his <hi>Pictures!</hi> Shall we wonder at his <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence,</hi> when we gaze vpon it in his ſtately <hi>Edifices!</hi> and may wee not as well bee rauiſhed, when wee ſee his ſharpe Wit, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Judgement, his infinite Memorie, his Excellent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in his admirable <hi>Writings?</hi> Certainely it is a peruerſnes to esteeme a man least, for that whereby hee liues the longest; to value him more for the outward worke of his hand, then for the inward operation of his minde; to esteeme him more for that which instructs but little, then for that which ſhall edifie for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. What now remaines of <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſo famous as his <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries?</hi> What of <hi>Cicero,</hi> as his <hi>Orations?</hi> How comes <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> to be of more authoritie then <hi>Alexander? Seneca,</hi> then <hi>Nero?</hi> The Triumphes and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictories of the one are vaniſhed; the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertues of the other remaine in their perfect vigour: And though all other <hi>Monuments</hi> by time conſume and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; yet theſe by time, gaine ſtrength and get authoritie; and euer the more ancient, the more Excellent.</p>
            <p>Hauing now deliuered my opinion, that J thinke it neither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull nor inconuenient for a <hi>King</hi> to write, but that he hath the Liberty that other men haue, if hee can get the leyſure; to ſhew his abilities for the preſent, to perpetuate his Memory to <hi>Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> to aduance his praiſe before his owne People, and gaine Glory from others; but eſpecially to giue <hi>Glory</hi> vnto <hi>GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>J will craue leaue to deſcend to an other Conſideration: for it may be, there will not be ſo much fault found with a <hi>King</hi> for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as for the matter or Subiect whereof he treates: For <hi>Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> of their eminent Degree and <hi>State,</hi> muſt not ſpend their paines on poore purpoſes; nor write ſo much to try their witts
<pb facs="tcp:23110:14"/>on triuiall thinges, as to winne themſelues Honor by the Excellency of their ſubiect. Jndeed, if I were worthy to aduiſe a <hi>King,</hi> hee ſhould meddle very ſparingly, and but vpon important Cauſes, with <hi>Polemicalls:</hi> Hee ſhould not often fight but in the field; for put the caſe a <hi>King</hi> writ neuer ſo modeſtly, that there be not in a whole Booke one word <hi>ad hominem,</hi> nor any touch of his Aduerſary in any perſonall infirmity; yet J know not how it comes to paſſe, that in all Controuerſies, a ſolide anſwere to an argument, is a very ſufficient occaſion to make an Aduerſary wonderfull angrie. And ſo long as there are diuerſity of Opinions, there will neuer want matter for Confutations. And in theſe Replications the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a <hi>King</hi> is more expoſed and lyes more open, then the perſon of a poore Scholler can doe; for as he is a farre greater marke, ſo he may farre more eaſily be hit: And though they miſſe him and can hit vpon nothing iuſtly to bee reprehended in him; yet they doe thinke it <hi>Operaepretium,</hi> to make a Scarre in the face of a <hi>King;</hi> Whereas on the contrary, if a <hi>King</hi> doe write of <hi>Piety</hi> or <hi>Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> compile a <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> giue <hi>Precepts</hi> of <hi>Policy,</hi> handle Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, or treate of ſome rare Experiences of Nature; wee doe in theſe things commend his Iudgement, admire his parts without any euill cogitation against his Perſon. There can hardly be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a more viue Example in this caſe, then is to be found in the <hi>Writings</hi> of his <hi>Maieſtie.</hi> When the <hi>King</hi> had publiſhed his <hi>Baſilicon-Doron,</hi> a Booke ſo ſingularly penned; that a Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granat is not ſo full of kernells, as that is of Excellent <hi>Counſells:</hi> What applauſe had it in the world? How did it inflame mens minds to a loue and admiration of his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> beyond meaſure; Inſomuch that comming out iust at the time his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> came in, it made the hearts of all his people as one Man, as much to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him for Religion and Learning, as to obey him for Title and Authoritie; and gaue vs then a taſte, or rather the first fruits, of that we haue ſince reaped a plentifull Harueſt of, by his <hi>Maieſties</hi> moſt prudent and Gracious Gouernment ouer vs. The like I may ſay of his <hi>Maieſties Demonologie;</hi> a rare peece for many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Experiments, both in <hi>Diuinitie</hi> and Naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie.
<pb facs="tcp:23110:14"/>Jn theſe, there was nothing heard of, but Sunne-ſhine and faire-weather; euery countenance ſweet and ſmiling vpon them: But as ſoone as his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> dealt against the <hi>Pope,</hi> tooke the <hi>Cardinall</hi> in hand, made the world ſee the vſurped power of the one, and Sophiſtry of the other; Good Lord, what a ſtirre we had; what roaring of the wilde Bulls of <hi>Baſan,</hi> what a commotion in euery Countrey; Jnſomuch, that I thinke, there is ſcarce a People, Language or Nation in <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> out of which his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> hath not receiued ſome anſwere or other; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by way of reſuting, or at leaſt by rayling: So that, had not the <hi>King</hi> contemned and made himſelfe ſport and recreation by ſuch kinde of Reuelling, rather then bene mooued to paſsion; It could not haue bene but a marueilous perturbation to a <hi>Prince</hi> of ſo exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſenſe and vnderſtanding. But what of all this? Shall wee wiſh his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> had not fought with beaſts at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſtopped the roaring of the <hi>Bull,</hi> nor encountered the <hi>Cardinall?</hi> Trewly when J thinke vpon the wonderfull abuſes, and Hyperbolicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> hath receiued from theſe men; I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of that minde: But when on the other ſide, J conſider his <hi>Maieſties</hi> zeale for to maintaine the cauſe of <hi>GOD</hi> and Right of <hi>Kings;</hi> his ſingular dexteritie to doe it; the bleſsing of <hi>GOD</hi> that hath followed vpon his ſo doing of it; I cannot but change my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and bee of another minde. And the better to induce you to bee of my minde; I will make vnto you a trew Relation of his <hi>Maieſties</hi> entering into this buſineſſe, and then leaue it to your conſideration; whether there were not a <hi>Diuine hand,</hi> that led his into it, or no. Jt is the Speach of our Bleſſed <hi>Sauiour,</hi> that there is nothing hid, that ſhall not be knowne; and what is ſpoken in darkeneſſe, ſhall be heard in the Light: This his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> as himſelfe confeſſeth, found trew in the comming foorth of one of his Bookes; and I thinke it may bee found as trew in the comming foorth of ſome other of them. For after the <hi>Pope</hi> had put forth his <hi>Breues,</hi> and the <hi>Cardinall</hi> had ſent his Letters to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt; the one to enioyne the People not to take the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,</hi> affirming they could not take it with ſafety of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation;
<pb facs="tcp:23110:15"/>the other to reproue the Arch-priest for that hee had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, and to draw him to a penitencie for ſo foule a Lapſe: His <hi>Maieſtie</hi> like as became a Prudent and a Religious <hi>Prince,</hi> thought it not meete, that theſe things ſhould paſse for current, but that it was expedient his People ſhould know, that the taking of this <hi>Oath</hi> was ſo farre from endangering their Soules, as that it intended nothing but ciuill Obedience, and without touching any point of their conſcience, made the <hi>State</hi> ſecure of their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. To performe this worke, his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> thought the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> that then was, a very fit man, both for his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Learning, as for that he had long laboured in an Argument not much of a diuers nature from this: Whereupon his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> calling for penne and incke, to giue my L. of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, how and in what maner to proceed in this Argument, I know not how it came to paſſe; but it fell out trew, that the <hi>Poet</hi> ſaith,
<q>
                  <l>— Amphora coepit</l>
                  <l>Inſtitui, currente rota, poſt vrceus exit.</l>
               </q> For the <hi>Kings</hi> Penne ranne ſo faſt, that in the compaſse of ſixe dayes, his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> had accompliſhed that, which hee now calleth his <hi>Apologie;</hi> which when my Lord of <hi>Canterburie</hi> that then was, and my Lord of <hi>Elie</hi> had peruſed, being indeed deliuered by his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> but as briefe Notes, and in the nature of a Minute to bee explicated by the <hi>Biſhop</hi> in a larger <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>olume; yet they thought it ſo ſufficient an Anſwere both to the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> as there needed no other: Whereupon his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, to giue way to the comming of it foorth, but was pleaſed to conceale his Name: And ſo haue wee the <hi>Apologie</hi> beyond his <hi>Maieſties</hi> owne purpoſe or determination.</p>
            <p>After that the <hi>Apologie</hi> was out, his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> diuerſe times would bee pleaſed to vtter a Reſolution of his; that if the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardinall</hi> would not rest in his anſwere, and ſit downe by it; take the <hi>Oath</hi> as it was intended for a point of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and Ciuill Obedience; Hee would publiſh the <hi>Apologie</hi> in his owne name with a <hi>Preface</hi> to all the <hi>Princes</hi> in <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:23110:15"/>wherein hee would publiſh ſuch a Confeſsion of his Faith, perſwade the <hi>Princes</hi> ſo to vindicate their owne Power, diſcouer ſo much of the <hi>Myſterie</hi> of Jniquitie vnto them; as the <hi>Popes Bulles</hi> ſhould pull in their hornes, and himſelfe wiſh he had neuer medled with this matter. The <hi>Cardinall</hi> contending against the <hi>Apologie,</hi> his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> confirmed his Reſolution, and with the like Celerity, in the compaſſe of one weeke, wrote his <hi>Monitory-Preface:</hi> for as <hi>Hirtius</hi> ſaid of <hi>Caeſars Comentaries, Qua foelicitate</hi> they were done, let others iudge; but <hi>Qua celeritate,</hi> J can tell: And being ſo written, publiſhed it and the <hi>Apologie</hi> in his owne Name; and made good his word, ſent it to the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> and all the <hi>Kings</hi> and free <hi>Princes</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now hauing made this Relation, wherein J haue deliuered nothing but trewth; Let me offer vnto you ſome few things worthy Conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that vpon the comming foorth of that Booke, there were no <hi>States,</hi> that diſauowed the Doctrine of it in that point of the <hi>Kings</hi> power; And the <hi>Venetians</hi> mainetained it in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and put it in Execution; The <hi>Sorbons</hi> maintained it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, their owne writers, that oppoſed it, ſo ouerlaſhed, as they were corrected and castigated of men of their owne Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Becanus</hi> his Booke corrected by the <hi>Cardinalles</hi> of <hi>Rome; Bellarmines</hi> Booke burnt in <hi>Paris; Suarez</hi> his Anſwere burnt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in <hi>France.</hi> As for the Raylers, I leaue them to God his Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whoſe hand hath bene vpon the moſt of them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, his <hi>Maieſties</hi> Confeſsion of faith, hath bene ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally approued, as it hath conuerted many of their partie: And had it not bene (as J haue bene informed by diuerſe) for the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> many more would eaſily haue bene induced, to ſubſcribe to all in that <hi>Preface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> haue by his <hi>Maieſties Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,</hi> had a more cleare inſight, and a more perfect diſcouery into the Iniury offered them by the <hi>Pope</hi> in the point of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Power, then euer they had; Jnſomuch, as that point was
<pb facs="tcp:23110:16"/>neuer ſo throughly diſputed in <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> as it hath bene by the occaſion of his <hi>Maieſties</hi> Booke.</p>
            <p>Fiftly and lastly, for the point of <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> I haue heard many confeſſe, that they neuer ſaw ſo much light giuen to that <hi>Myſterie,</hi> neuer deſcerned ſo much trewth by the vniforme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Text, and ſtrength of Interpretation of places, as they haue done by his <hi>Maieſties</hi> Booke. So that, though Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies be fitter ſubiects for Schollers ordinarily, then for <hi>Kings;</hi> Yet when there was ſuch a neceſsitie in vndertaking, and ſuch a ſucceſſe being performed; I leaue it to the world to iudge, whether there were not a ſpeciall hand of <hi>GOD</hi> in it, or no. Now ſince I haue begunne with this point of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> J will make bolde to proceed a little with his <hi>Maieſties Paraphraſe</hi> vpon the <hi>Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> wherein that Treatiſe of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is principally grounded.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Maieſties</hi> ſingular vnderstanding in all points of good Learning is not vnknowne: But yet aboue all other things, <hi>GOD</hi> hath giuen him an vnderstanding Heart in the Interpretation of that <hi>Booke,</hi> beyond the meaſure of other men: For this <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe,</hi> that leades the way to all the rest of his <hi>Maieſties Workes,</hi> was written by his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> before hee was twenty yeeres of aage; and therefore iustly in this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>olume hath the first place, the rest following in order according to the time of their first penning. Anciently <hi>Kings</hi> drempt dreames, and ſaw viſions; and <hi>Prophets</hi> expounded them: So with <hi>King Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt;</hi> So with <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> in <hi>Babylon.</hi> Jn this aage, <hi>Prophets</hi> haue written <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſions, and <hi>Kings</hi> haue expounded them. <hi>GOD</hi> raiſed vp <hi>Prophets</hi> to deliuer his People from a temporall captiuitie in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> by the Jnterpretation of the one; And <hi>GOD</hi> hath in this aage ſtirred vp <hi>Kings</hi> to deliuer his People from a Spirituall <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the Interpretation of the other. It is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruable thing, that <hi>GOD</hi> neuer made his People any great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but he added vnto his promiſe a famous <hi>Prophecie.</hi> Three great promiſes we reade of, that runne through all the Scriptures.
<pb facs="tcp:23110:16"/>The first of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> the ſecond of the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> the third of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of Heauen: To theſe three promiſes, are reduced all the <hi>Prophecies.</hi> Of the promiſe of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> prophecied all the <hi>Prophets</hi> from the fall of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> to the comming of the ſecond: Of the promiſe of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> prophecied <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and the rest, from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to the poſſeſsing of it by <hi>Ioſuah</hi> and the children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Of the promiſe of the Kingdome of Heauen, made by our <hi>Sauiour CHRIST',</hi> prophecied the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> principally <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in the Reuelation. Now though all were to lay hold on the promiſes; yet few were able to vnderſtand the <hi>Prophecies.</hi> And ſurely, though all the people of <hi>GOD</hi> are to lay hold on the promiſes of that Glorious <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> deſcribed in that Booke; yet few are able to vnderſtand the <hi>Prophecies</hi> therein contained, comprehending in them a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> euen from the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> till the conſummation of the whole world. Yet this I thinke, I may ſafely ſay; That <hi>Kings</hi> haue a kinde of interest in that Booke beyond any other: for as the execution of the moſt part of the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of that Booke is committed vnto them; So it may be, that the Interpretation of it, may more happily be made by them: And ſince they are the principall Instruments, that <hi>GOD</hi> hath deſcribed in that Booke to destroy the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> to conſume his State and Citie; I ſee not, but it may ſtand with the Wiſedome of <hi>GOD,</hi> to inſpire their heart to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it; into whoſe handes hee hath put it to excute, vntill the <hi>LORD</hi> ſhall conſume both him and it with the Spirit of his mouth, and ſhall aboliſh it with the brightneſſe of his comming: For from the day that <hi>S. Iohn</hi> writ the Booke to this preſent houre; I doe not thinke that euer any <hi>King</hi> tooke ſuch paines, or was ſo perfect in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> as his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> is; which will eaſily appeare by this <hi>Paraphraſe,</hi> by his <hi>Maieſties Meditation</hi> on the <hi>20.</hi> Chap. and his <hi>Monitorie Preface.</hi> Jt was my purpoſe to haue past through all his <hi>Maieſties</hi> Books; to haue expreſſed the Argument and the occaſion of their writing; But I find by that J haue already
<pb facs="tcp:23110:17"/>ſaid, I ſhould be ouer tedious vnto you. This therefore in generall; They are all worthy of a <hi>King,</hi> and to be kept to Poſterity: For if <hi>Ouid</hi> could imagine, that no time ſhould eate out the memory of his <hi>Metamorphoſeis,</hi> which were but fictions; J hope no time ſhall ſee an end of theſe Books, that carry in them ſo much diuine trewth and light. And as in this first worke of the <hi>Paraphraſe,</hi> his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> hath ſhewed his <hi>Piety;</hi> So in this laſt <hi>Pearle</hi> (I meane <hi>his Maieſties Speach in the Starr-Chamber</hi>) his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> hath ſhewed his <hi>Policy:</hi> The firſt ſheweth, hee vnderſtands the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>GOD;</hi> this laſt, that hee as well apprehends the State of his <hi>Kingdomes</hi> in this <hi>World:</hi> The first ſheweth him to haue a large Portion in that of Heauen; and this laſt ſheweth him to haue a great Power and experience in theſe <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes</hi> hee hath on earth. Therefore, let theſe men, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light ſo much in Detraction and to vilify him, whom <hi>GOD</hi> hath exalted; and to ſhed his blood, whoſe Soule <hi>GOD</hi> hath bound vp in the Bundle of life; Let them, J ſay, write what euer the Subtilty of the olde <hi>Serpent</hi> can put into their heads, or the Malice of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> infuſe into their hearts; Let them ſpeake, what the poyſon of <hi>Aſpes</hi> is able to put into their lippes; they are not all able to make his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> to appeare leſſe then he is, nor to ſhew, that euer they had of theirs a <hi>King</hi> ſo accompliſhed. It is trew, that wee haue not had many <hi>Kings</hi> in this <hi>Kingdome</hi> of our Profeſsion: But for thoſe we haue had, this <hi>Iland</hi> of ours neuer ſaw the like, either for partes of Nature, giftes of Learning or Graces of <hi>Piety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The little time of life, that God lent to <hi>King Edward,</hi> must needs leſſen his prayſes; But neuer did there appeare beginnings of more rare perfection, then in him.</p>
            <p>The length of <hi>Queene Elizabeths</hi> dayes, together with the felicity of her time, was not only a Glory to her owne People, but a wonderment to the World, euen our Aduerſaries, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, being <hi>Iudges.</hi> And prayſed be <hi>GOD,</hi> the preſent time paſſeth a long with the like felicity and much more Securitie: for let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a little, for the Glory of <hi>GOD</hi> and encouragement of his
<pb facs="tcp:23110:17"/>
               <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> to goe on in his happie Courſe begunne, the Bleſsings of <hi>GOD</hi> we receiue by him; And then let our Aduerſaries tell vs, whether we be a miſerable People or no, as ſome of late haue gone about to perſwade vs. Neither doe J ſtand in feare of any mans reprehenſion; for J will ſpeake nothing but trewth, and I haue my <hi>Preſident</hi> from <hi>GOD</hi> his owne Booke; wherein the good Actes of euery good <hi>King</hi> are to their eternall praiſes trewly recounted.</p>
            <p>First to beginne with <hi>Religion,</hi> as the Generall to the Armie: Of all Gods Bleſsings wee haue it without any alteration or change contynued vnto vs. His <hi>Maieſties</hi> firſt Care was for the Confirmation of the Goſpell: for at his <hi>Maieſties</hi> firſt comming in; who knowes not the endeauours of men, to haue made a change, either to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or to the <hi>Puritanes?</hi> His <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie</hi> therefore, to quiet the <hi>State</hi> and Peace of the Church, called a Conference at <hi>Hampton-Court;</hi> where paſsing ouer the one, as being neuer in his heart to giue the leaſt way vnto; He ſo tempered the other, as the Harmony hath bene the better euer ſince.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Religion</hi> thus ratified; His <hi>Maieſties</hi> next Care was for the Tranſlation of the <hi>Bible,</hi> it being the ground of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: His <hi>Maieſtie</hi> was deſirous his People ſhould haue it in as much perfection, as the Jnduſtrie and Labors of the best Learned were able to afford it them.</p>
            <p>Hauing done what was neceſſary for the Spirituall part of the Church, his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> tooke into conſideration the Temporal State thereof: No ſooner came the <hi>Parliament,</hi> but finding what ſpoile had bene made of the Lands thereof in the tyme of his <hi>Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,</hi> by a libertie they had to take the Landes of the Church for a longer Terme then others could doe; Cut himſelfe off from that libertie, and equalled himſelfe to a common perſon in the taking of any State in the Churches Landes.</p>
            <p>When his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> had done this in <hi>England,</hi> he looked backe into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and reforming the State of the Church there, as farre as in his <hi>Princely-Wiſedome</hi> he thought conuenient for the time; reſtored the <hi>Biſhops</hi> there, as to their Spirituall <hi>Keies;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:23110:18"/>ſo to their temporall <hi>Eſtates,</hi> though it were to the great loſſe and dammage of his owne Reuennue and <hi>Crowne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Scotland</hi> his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> came to <hi>Ireland,</hi> that forlorne <hi>Kingdome</hi> both for Temporall and Spiritual eſtate, till be looked into it: There his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> hath reduced the <hi>Biſhoppricks,</hi> not only to their old Rents; but added vnto them many new <hi>Reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues;</hi> ſo that many places there are anſwerable to the beſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings here: Neither hath his Care bene onely on theſe high places of the Church, but hath deſcended to the lowest in the ſame, hauing both protected the <hi>Benefices</hi> from being rayſed to any higher Taxe, and hindred all courſes, that might giue his Cleargie mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation or trouble.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Maieſties Bountie</hi> hath not bene wanting to Colledges and Hoſpitalls, hauing parted with his owne Tenures, to giue them power of larger Indowments; whereby there hath bene works of more ſumptuouſnes and coſt done in his <hi>Maieſties</hi> time, then there hath bene in any one aage before.</p>
            <p>J may not forget one thing, that ſince his <hi>Maieſties</hi> comming to this <hi>Crowne,</hi> he hath neuer put into his Coffers the meane prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitts of any Eccleſiaſticall liuing, but hath bene a <hi>Fidus-Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius,</hi> and euer giuen them to the next Jncumbent.</p>
            <p>Let me deſcend a little from theſe workes of <hi>Piety</hi> to <hi>Peace.</hi> Neuer hath there bene ſo vniuerſall a Peace in <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> ſince the time of our <hi>Sauiour Chriſt,</hi> as in theſe his Dayes: And I dare ſay, as much, if not more, by the procurement of his <hi>Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,</hi> then by any other earthly meanes in this world. A <hi>Peace</hi> (to let forraigne partes paſſe) ſo entertayned at home; that in his <hi>Maieſties</hi> three <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> apt enough by conſtitution, and not vnaccuſtomed by practiſe to be at variance, there hath bene no Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill diſſenſion at all. With <hi>Peace GOD</hi> hath giuen vs Plentie: So that, if Peace and Plenty haue not made vs too too wanton, I know not what wee want. Neither is there any crying out for lacke of <hi>Iuſtice</hi> in our <hi>Courtes;</hi> for neuer was there Iustice ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred with more liberty from the <hi>King,</hi> nor more vprightnes from the Judges; And yet in the free diſpenſation of <hi>Iuſtice,
<pb facs="tcp:23110:18"/>Mercie</hi> did neuer more triumph. If this bee to bee miſerable, J know not what on earth they call Happineſſe: <hi>GOD</hi> continue theſe ſtill vnto vs; and then, let them call Happineſſe, what they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>But I know wherefore all is miſerable; becauſe there is no more Mercy ſhewed to their <hi>Catholiks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>J will put it as a <hi>Crowne</hi> vpon all his <hi>Maieſties Mercies:</hi> There was neuer <hi>King,</hi> that had ſo great a cauſe giuen him, that euer tooke ſo little bloode, extending his Mercy to all, that were not perſonall workers in that <hi>Powder-Plot:</hi> And before that you had hatched that Monſter, neither was the perſon or purſe of any your reputed Catholicks touched. And ſince that time, you may doe well to complaine of your Miſeries; but the Church and Comonwealth both, doe trauaile and groane vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of your diſobedience: But the worst J wiſh you, is, that at length by his <hi>Maieſties</hi> long <hi>Patience,</hi> you may bee drawne to Repentance; for as we are come out from you, lest we ſhould bee partakers of your plagues; ſo we pray for you, that you may come in to vs, that you may be participants of our felicities.</p>
            <p>To Conclude this <hi>Preface: GOD</hi> hath giuen vs a <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>GOD</hi> aboue all things gaue <hi>Solomon</hi> Wiſedome; Wiſedome brought him peace; Peace brought him Riches; Riches gaue him Glory. His wiſedome appeared in his wordes and <hi>Workes:</hi> his Peace, he preſerued by the power of his Army: His riches he ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as by his Reuennue, ſo by the Trade of his Nauie: His Glory did accrue from them all. Now, as in theſe, <hi>GOD</hi> exalted him beyond all the <hi>Kings</hi> that euer were, or ſhould be after him; So had he in other things Humiliations not farre behind the proportion of his Exaltations; the fearefullest fall, that the Scripture affords an Example of; the most vnchast life and immoderate exceſſe of <hi>Women,</hi> that we read of; the weakest Posterity for Wiſedome and Gouernment, that we finde in all the Line of his Succeſsion. <hi>GOD</hi> would haue it ſo, that he ſhould no more be ſet out, as a Type of the <hi>Glory</hi> of his owne <hi>Sonne</hi> in the felicity of his State one way, then he would haue him propoſed as a patterne of Humane
<pb facs="tcp:23110:19"/>frailty an other way. Therefore, though we may not approach him in his Typicall State; yet <hi>GODS</hi> Name be bleſsed, that hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs to goe farre beyond him in his perſonall Condition: For we haue already, bleſſed be <hi>GOD,</hi> ſeene the Conſtancie and perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his <hi>Maieſty</hi> in his Holy Profeſsion, without any <hi>Eclipſe</hi> or Shaddow of change, longer then we are well able to deduce the whole life and reigne of <hi>Solomon.</hi> We haue not the Daughter of <hi>Pharao</hi> an Idolatrous <hi>King;</hi> nor feare we ſtrange women to ſteale away his heart from the Seruice of <hi>GOD:</hi> But a <hi>Queene,</hi> as of a <hi>Royall,</hi> ſo of a Religious Stocke, profeſsing the Goſpell of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with him; A <hi>Mirrour</hi> of trew Modestie, a <hi>Queene</hi> of Bounty, both beloued and admired of all his People: A <hi>Poſterity</hi> that we need not feare for folly in the one Sexe, nor for leuitie in the other; Both which made <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeake ſo much, (as the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſay) in his <hi>Prouerbes,</hi> of a fooliſh ſonne, becauſe his owne was not wiſe, and of wanton Women, becauſe he feared the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his owne Daughters. But <hi>GOD</hi> hath left his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> a <hi>Sonne;</hi> a <hi>Prince,</hi> as in outward <hi>Liniaments,</hi> ſo in inward <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments,</hi> (I need ſay no more) an <hi>Alter-Idem,</hi> a ſecond-Selfe; A <hi>Daughter,</hi> a <hi>Princeſſe</hi> of that Piety, ſingular vertue and Modestie; as makes her both beloued at home and admired abroad. J haue done: Only I deſire the <hi>Readers</hi> of theſe <hi>Workes,</hi> to pray to <hi>GOD,</hi> that as he hath ſo farre aduanced vs, as to bestowe vpon vs, with the Heauenly Treaſures of his trewth, the riches of his earthly <hi>Iewels</hi> in ſo <hi>Sacred</hi> a <hi>King,</hi> ſo admired a <hi>Queene,</hi> ſo hopefull a <hi>Prince,</hi> ſo vertuous a <hi>Princes;</hi> He would for his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſake, for his Sonnes ſake, continue this the Light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance vpon vs in them and their <hi>Poſterity,</hi> till the comming of that <hi>Kingdome,</hi> which neuer ſhall haue end. <hi>AMEN.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O whom could I haue ſo fitly</hi> directed (Christian Readers) this <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> of mine vpon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,</hi> as vnto you, who are the very and true poſteritie of thoſe Churches, to whom the Booke it ſelfe was dedicated, and for whoſe instruction and comfort the ſaid E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle was endited by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and written by that great Theologue <hi>IOHN the Apoſtle,</hi> whom our Master beloued deerely? J doubt not but it will ſeeme ſtrange to many, that any of my aage, calling, and litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhould haue medled with ſo obſcure, Theologicall, and high a ſubiect: But let my earnest deſire (by manifesting the Trueth,) as well to teach my ſelfe as others, ſerue for excuſe; conſidering alſo that where diuers others in our aage, haue medled with the interpretation of this Booke, preſsing with preoccupied opinions, onely to wrest and conforme the meaning thereof to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and priuate paſsions; J by the contrary proteſt, that all my trauailes tend to ſquare and conforme my opinions to the trew and ſincere meaning thereof: Which cauſes mooued me to vndertake this worke; not thereby to deſpiſe infinite others, who to the glory
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23110:21"/>of God, and great comfort of his Church, hath giuen it a great light already, but rather that by oft peruſing and dew conſidering therof, whereto this worke hath led mee, J might be the better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the meaning of this Booke, which J eſteeme a ſpeciall cannon against the Hereticall wall of our common aduerſaries the Papists: whom I would wiſh to know, that in this my <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> vpon it, J haue vſed nothing of my owne coniecture, or of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of others, but onely haue interpreted it, in that ſenſe which may best agree with the methode of the Epistle, and not bee contradictorie to it ſelfe: The meaning whereof I expound, partly by it ſelfe, and partly by other parts of the Scriptures, as the worke it ſelfe will beare witneſſe: And therefore this one thing J must craue of our Aduerſaries, that they will not refute any part of my Interpretation, till they finde out a more probable them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, agreeing with the whole context, <hi>&amp; cum ſerie tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi> and where their conſciences beare them witneſſe that J ſpeake the Trueth, that they will yeeld vnto it, and glorifie God therein, and this is all the reward I craue for my paines. But of one thing I must forewarne you (Chriſtian Readers) <hi>to wit,</hi> that yee may vnderſtand, that it is for the making of the Diſcourſe more ſhort and facile, that I haue made <hi>IOHN</hi> to be the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in all this <hi>Paraphraſe;</hi> and not that I am ſo preſumptuouſly fooliſh, as to haue meant thereby, that my <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> is the onely trew and certaine expoſition of this Epiſtle, reiecting all others: For although through ſpeaking in his perſon, I am onely bounded and limitted to vſe one, and not diuers interpretations, of euery ſeuerall place; yet I condemne not others, but rather allow them to interpret it diuerſly, ſo being, it agree with the analogie of faith, with the methode of the Text, <hi>&amp; cum ſerie temporum,</hi> as I ſaid before: for thoſe three being obſerued, it may fall out that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, diuerſly expound one place, and yet all be according to the trueth, and very meaning of the Spirit of God, as may eaſily be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Text it ſelfe: For in the 17. Chapter the Angel expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Iohn,</hi> the ſeuen heads of the beaſtes that came out of the Sea, hee ſaith the ſeuen heads which thou ſawest vpon the beast
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23110:21"/>are the <hi>ſeuen Hills,</hi> and they are alſo <hi>ſeuen Kings:</hi> Here ye ſee one thing is expounded in two very farre different faſhions, and yet both true; And therefore let wiſe men take their choice in theſe things, obſeruing alwayes theſe rules I haue ſpoken of; as ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for example; This Hebrew word <hi>Arma geddon</hi> in the <hi>16.</hi> Chapter and ſixt Phiale, although I expound it to ſignifie <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction by deceipt,</hi> as compoſed of <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Gnarma &amp; Geddon</hi> which may very well agree with the Hiſtory, becauſe it is the name of the place, ſaith <hi>Iohn,</hi> where the wicked being aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together by the alluring and deceipt of Satan, and his three ſpirits of Diuels to make warre with the faithfull, were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by God, and ſo their deſtruction came, and was procured by deceipt; Yet others interpret it to ſignifie <hi>deſtruction by waters,</hi> as compoſed of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Harma &amp; Geddon,</hi> which alſo may very well agree with the Historie. For waters indeed in this Booke ſignifie oft many people and Nations, as appeareth by the very Text in the <hi>17.</hi> Chapter; And others take it to be an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the destruction that <hi>Ioſhua</hi> made of Gods enemies vpon the hill of <hi>Mageddon,</hi> and therefore to bee compoſed of <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Booke or Epiſtle of <hi>Reuelation,</hi> was called in doubt, aſwell for the incertaintie of the Author, as alſo for the canonicalneſse of the Booke it ſelfe, by ſundry of the ancients, and ſpecially by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebe;</hi> For ſoluing whereof I need not to inſist, ſince it is both receiued now of all Christians, and alſo diuers of the Neoteriques, in ſpeciall <hi>Beza</hi> in his Preface vpon it, hath handled that matter ſufficiently alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; So that this doubt onely rests now in men, that this Booke is ſo obſcure and allegorique, that it is in a maner vnprofitable to be taught or interpreted; Whereunto I will ſhortly make anſwere, and then goe forward to ſet downe the methode of the ſame: And therefore to make a deduction from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, let vs vnderstand in what ſeuerall or principall parts the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may be diuided in; and then which of them this Booke is. How ſoone <hi>Adam</hi> being made perfect in his Creation, and hauing the choiſe of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death, Good</hi> and <hi>Euill,</hi> did by his horrible defection make choiſe of <hi>Death,</hi> and cast off <hi>Life,</hi> and by that meanes infected his whole posteritie with double ſinne, <hi>to wit, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall</hi> and <hi>Actuall,</hi> God notwithstanding had ſuch a Loue to mankinde, as being his most Noble workemanſhip, and Creature, made to his owne Likeneſſe and Image, that he ſelected a Church amongst them, whom firſt becauſe of their weakeneſſe and incredulitie, he with his owne mouth taught, and next inſtructed and raiſed vp notable men amongst them to be their Rulers, whom he endued with ſuch excellent gifts, as not onely their example in life preached, but alſo by Miracles they ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and confirmed their Faith: But leſt this miniſtrie of men ſhould make them to depend onely vpon their mouthes, forgetting Him, and making Gods of them, he at length out of his owne mouth gaue them his Law, which he cauſed them to put in Writ, and retaine ſtill amongst them; And then leſt they ſhould forget and neglect the ſame, he raiſed vp godly Rulers, aſ well Temporall, as Spirituall, who by their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liues and working of Miracles, reuiued and ſtrengthened the Law in their hearts.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23110:22"/>But ſeeing, that notwithſtanding all this, they caſt themſelues headlong in the gulfe of vices (ſuch is the vnthankefull and repining Nature of Man,) hee raiſed vp Prophets, as especially <hi>Ieremie</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> to accuſe them of their ſinnes, and by Viſions to forewarne them of the times to come, whereby the godly might turne and arme themſelues, and the wicked might be made inexcuſable. And thus much for the Old Teſtament. But then God ſeeing that notwithſtanding this, there crept in ſuch a generall corruption amongst them, that ſcarce one might be found that bowed not his knee to Baal; Hee then by his vnſearchable Wiſedome incarnated his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Sonne and Word <hi>THE LORD IESVS,</hi> who by his death and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion accompliſhed the faith of the Fathers; whoſe Saluation was by the beleeuing in him to come, as alſo made an open and patent way of Grace to all the world there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: And then as vpon a new world, and a new Church, Gods Fatherly care to Mankind was renued, but in a more fauourable forme, becauſe hee looked vpon the Merits of his deare Sonne: Then, firſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> with his owne mouth did inſtruct men, and confirmed his Doctrine by Miracles, and ſecondly raiſed vp the Apoſtles to giue the Law of Faith, confirming it by their liues and Miracles: And laſt, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this Defection was beginning to creepe in againe, hee inspired one of them, <hi>to wit, IOHN</hi> to write this Booke, that hee might thereby, euen as <hi>Ieremie</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> did in the old Law, aſwell rebuke them of their ſinnes, as by forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, to arme them againſt the great tentations that were to come after. Then of it ſelfe it prooues, how profitable this Booke is for this aage, ſeeing it is the laſt <hi>Reuelation</hi> of Gods will and Propheſie, that euer was, or ſhall bee in the World: For wee ſhall haue no more Propheſies nor Miracles hereafter, but muſt content our ſelues with the Law and Prophecies already giuen, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Parable of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> and the rich man teacheth. Now as to the Methode, this holy Epiſtle is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the ſeuen Churches of <hi>Aſia Minor,</hi> whom hee names and writes to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the firſt three Chapters of the ſame, and vnder their Names to all their trew Succeſſors, the whole Church Militant in the World. The whole matter may bee diuided in ſixe parts, <hi>to wit, The praiſe or diſpraiſe of euery one of theſe Churches,</hi> according to their merits wherein they merit good or euill, what way they ought to reforme themſelues, and this is contained in the three firſt Chapters: And to make them inexcuſable, in caſe they ſlide againe, hee ſhewes the eſtate of the whole Church Militant in their time; he tells them what it ſhall be vntill the end of the World, and what it ſhalbe when it is Triumphant and immortall after the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: <hi>Theſe three laſt parts are declared by Viſions in the reſt of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle,</hi> firſt the preſent eſtate of the Church then, and what it ſhould be thereafter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the later day, is ſummarily declared by the firſt ſixe of the ſeuen Seales: in the ſixt and ſeuenth Chapters, and afterwards more at large by the ſeuen Trumpets that came out of the ſeuenth Seale in the <hi>8. 9. 10. 11.</hi> Chapters: And becauſe through Tirannie and abuſe of the Popedome, Poperie is the greateſt temptation ſince <hi>Chriſtes</hi> firſt comming, or that ſhalbe vnto his last; therefore he ſpecially inſiſts more at large and cleerly, in the declaration and painting forth of the ſame, by Viſion of the woman in the wilderneſſe, and of the Beaſts that roſe out of the ſea and the earth in the <hi>12. 13.</hi> and <hi>14.</hi> Chapters: And then to comfort men that might otherwiſe deſpaire,
<note place="margin">Chap. 15.16.</note> becauſe of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23110:23"/>greatneſſe of that temptation, he declares by the next following Viſion of the Phials, what plagues ſhall light vpon the Pope and his followers: Next, he deſcribes him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<note place="margin">Chap. 17.18.19. Chap. 20.</note> farre clearer then any time before, and likewiſe his ruine, together with the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of the Earth, and ioy of Heauen therefore: And then to inculcate and ingraue the better the foreſaid Viſions in the hearts and memories of Men, hee in a Viſion makes a ſhort ſumme and recapitulation of them, <hi>to wit,</hi> of the preſent estate of the Church then, and what it ſhould bee thereafter, vnto the Day of <hi>Iudgement,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a ſhort deſcription of the ſaid Day: And laſt he deſcribes by a Viſion, the glorious reward of them, who conſtantly perſiſt in the Trueth, reſisting all the temptations which he hath forespoken, <hi>To wit,</hi> he deſcribes the bleſſed eſtate of the holy and Eternall <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Church Triumphant,</hi> and ſo with a ſhort and pithie Concluſion makes an end.</p>

For although the Sunne, and the Moone, and the ſtarres be all bright lampes and lights of the heauen, yet are they not all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like bright, but the brightneſſe of euery one of them is different from the other; Alwayes let vs aſſure our ſelues, that although our meaſures ſhall be vnequall, yet from the greateſt to the leaſt, all the veſſels of mercie ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy in all fulneſſe, as much glory as they ſhalbe able to containe, and the vnequalitie of the meaſure ſhalbe, becauſe they are notable euery one of them to containe alike in quantitie; and the like ſhalbe done with the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of paines to the reprobate in hell. <hi rend="sup">14</hi> Then I beheld, and loe I ſaw a white cloud, and vpon the cloud ſate one like a man, hauing on his head a crowne of gold, and in his hand a ſharpe ſickle: <hi rend="sup">15</hi> And an other Angel came out of the temple, &amp; cried with a lowd voice to him that ſate vpon the cloud, Thruſt in thy ſickle to reape, for the houre of thy reaping is come, and the harueſt of the earth is withered for ripeneſſe, and readineſſe to be cut: He who was like the Sunne of man, and was ſitting on a white cloud, was Chriſt in a bright cloud of glory, crowned with a Crowne of victory; all that was ſpoken of him here, was to declare to me, that the laſt dayes wherein his comming againe ſhalbe, ſhall be next following, to the reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the reuiuing of the witneſſes, as ye heard in the end of the ſixt Trumpet; <hi rend="sup">16</hi> At what time Chriſt ſhall gather his harueſt of the elect together, as I heard himſelfe ſay while he was yet on earth among vs. <hi rend="sup">17</hi> Then another Angel came forth of the Temple that is in heauen, and he had an other ſharp ſickle in his hand: <hi rend="sup">18</hi> And an other Angel came from the Altar, who had power ouer the fire, and he cried with a lowd voice to him that had the other ſharpe ſickle, ſaying, Put downe thy ſharpe ſickle, and gather the cluſters of the Vine-trees, for the grapes are ripe. <hi rend="sup">19</hi> Then the Angel put downe his ſickle on the earth, and gathered the Vines of the

The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion then was this; <hi rend="sup">1</hi> I ſaw an Angel come downe from heauen, and he had the key of the bottomleſſe pit, and a great chaine in his hand: <hi rend="sup">2</hi> And hee tooke the dragon, <hi>to wit,</hi> the ancient ſerpent, who is the deuill and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, <hi>to wit,</hi> the Tempter, and bound him for the ſpace of a thouſand yeres: <hi rend="sup">3</hi> And did caſt him in the bottomleſſe pit, and cloſed him in there, that it ſhould not be opened, that he might come foorth and ſeduce the nations, till the ſpace of a thouſand yeeres were completed and paſt, for thereafter he muſt be looſed for a ſhort ſpace. <hi rend="sup">4</hi> Then I ſaw ſeats, and perſons ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon them, and iudgment or power of iudging was giuen vnto them: And I alſo ſaw the ſoules of them who were beheaded, or otherwiſe put to death, for the teſtimonie of Chriſt, and the word of God, and adored not the Beaſt, nor tooke his image, neither his character on their foreheads,

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:23110:56"/>the light or brightneſſe of it, was like vnto the glittering of a moſt pretious ſtone, yea euen like the greene <hi>Iasper</hi> in flouriſhing eternitie, and like the cleare <hi>Cristall</hi> in ſhining brightneſſe; <hi rend="sup">12</hi> And this Citie had a great and high wall, to hold out all them who had not the marke of the <hi>Lambe,</hi> as ye ſhall heare after, and to protect the Citizens from all blaſtes of troubles, for all teares will then bee wipte from their eyes, as ye heard before; And this Citie had alſo twelue gates, and in them twelue Angels, and their names were written vpon them, which were the names of the twelue Tribes of the ſonnes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 
                     <hi rend="sup">13</hi> And there were three gates towards the Eaſt, three towards the Weſt, three towards the South, and three to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, to ſignifie that out of all parts and places of the world, and whatſoeuer thy vocation be, if thou call to God with an vpright heart, thou ſhalt find that the entrance into the Citie, is equally diſtributed about the ſame. <hi rend="sup">14</hi> And the wall of the Citie had twelue foundations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon were written the twelue names of the Apoſtles of the <hi>Lambe:</hi> Theſe twelue Angels of the twelue gates, and twelue foundations of the wall, are the foure and twentie Elders, of whom ye heard in the beginning of this my Epiſtle; the twelue Angels of the twelue gates, are the twelue Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes, who were the firſt teachers of the way, and ſo the guides to this holy <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> for by the Law which they repreſent, we muſt firſt beginne to know the trewth, and to know our ſelues: and the twelue foundations are we, the twelue Apoſtles, for vpon our doctrine is that wall founded which hedgeth in the Saints in an eternall ſecuritie, and debarreth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi rend="sup">15</hi> And the Angel who ſpake with me, had a golden reed in his hand, to meaſure therewith the Citie, and the gates, and the walles of the ſame, thereby to ſignifie the iuſt proportion and ſymmetrie, that ſhall be among all the parts of this holy Citie. <hi rend="sup">16</hi> And this Citie was foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquare, becauſe of the gates towards the foure parts of the earth, to receiue indifferently the commers out of any of them, as yee heard before; And it was alike long and broad, to ſignifie the infinite bounds thereof: and hee meaſured the Citie with his reed, and it came to twelue thouſand furlongs: this number alſo expreſſeth the great bounds of this Citie; for it is here vſed for a number of perfection, as ſundry times before: And this Citie was alike in length, breadth and height, for all the parts of it were alike large. <hi rend="sup">17</hi> And the Angel did meaſure the wall of it, and it was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and foure and fourtie cubites of height: this number is correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the number of Saints, who were ſtanding with the <hi>Lambe</hi> on <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> as ye heard before; and the meaſure wherewith this was mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, was the meaſure of the man, which is the meaſure of the Angel; This Citie is meaſured with the meaſure of CHRIST, God and man, to teach vs that he is onely the Architectour of this Spirituall Citie, which he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureth by his cubites, and not by the cubites of any man. <hi rend="sup">18</hi> And the fabricke of the wall of the Citie, was compoſed of <hi>Iasper,</hi> to ſignifie that the wall thereof ſhall ſtand eternally: and the Citie it ſelfe was of pure

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S touching the wordes in them for order ſake, wee may note: <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Firſt Satan his looſing: <hi rend="sup">2</hi> next his doing, after he is looſed: <hi rend="sup">3</hi> and laſt his vnhappie ſucceſſe.</p>
                  <p>Then for the firſt,
<note place="margin">Satan in his inſtruments is looſed to trouble the Church.</note> by Satan is meant not onely the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, enemie to Chriſt and his Church, but alſo with him all the inſtruments in whom he ruleth, and by whom he ruleth, and by whom he vttereth his cruell and crafty intentions, ſpecially the Antichriſt and his Clergie, ioyned with the Dragon before in the 16. Chap. verſe 17. and called the beaſt, and the falſe prophet. For as Chriſt and his Church are called after one Name, Chriſt, by reaſon of their moſt ſtrait and neere vnion, and heauenly effects flowing there from, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. So Satan and his ſinagogue are here rightly called Satan,
<note place="margin">The thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres.</note> by reaſon of their vnion, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed effects flowing therefrom. Theſe thouſand yeeres, are but a number cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine for an vncertaine, which phraſe or maner of ſpeaking, is often vſed by the Spirit of God in the Scriptures, meaning a great number of yeeres.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer,
<note place="margin">The priſon whereout Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is looſed.</note> the priſon whereout he is looſed, is the hels, which by the Spirit of God are called his priſon, for two cauſes: <hi rend="sup">1</hi> One, becauſe during the time of this world, at times appointed by God, he is debarred from walking on the earth,
<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.4. Ind. ver. 6.</note> and ſent thither, greatly to his torment, as was teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or witneſſed by the miracle at <hi>Genezareth</hi> among the <hi>Gadarens, Matth.</hi> 8.28. <hi rend="sup">2</hi> Next, becauſe that after the conſummation or end of the world, he ſhall be perpetually or for euer impriſoned therein, as is written in the ſame Chapter, ver. 10. Finally, he is looſed by interruption or hindering, and for the moſt part,
<note place="margin">The looſing of Satan.</note> to the iudgement of men, abolition or ouerthrow of the ſincere preaching of the Goſpel, the true vſe of the Sacraments, which are ſeales and pledges of the promiſes contained therein, and lawfull exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Chriſtian diſcipline, whereby both Word and Sacraments are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in purity, called in the firſt verſe the great chaine, whereby the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:23110:59"/>is bound and ſignified by the white horſe, gouerned by the Lambe. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>verſe</hi> 2. So the meaning of all this 7. verſe is this: The diuel, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bene bound, and his power in his inſtruments hauing bene reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a long ſpace, by the preaching of the Goſpel, at the laſt he is looſed out of hell by the raiſing vp of ſo many new errors and notable euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, eſpecially the Antichriſt and his Clergie, who not onely infect the earth a new, but rule alſo ouer the whole, through the decreaſe of trew doctrine, and the number of the faithfull following it, and the dayly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of errours, and nations following them, and beleeuing lies hating the trewth, and taking pleaſure in vnrighteouſnes, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.11, 12. And thus farre for Satan his looſing.</p>
                  <p>Now to the next, his doing after he is looſed.
<note place="margin">Satan firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth, then allures to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and in the end maketh all his to take armour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church.</note> Firſt he goeth out to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce or beguile the nations that are into the foure corners of the earth, and they become his, though in certaine degrees his tyrannie and trauaile appeareth, and burſteth out in ſome more then in others: For as all that doe good, are inſpired of God thereto, and doe vtter the ſame in certaine degrees, according vnto the meaſure of grace granted vnto them: ſo all that doe euill, are inſpired by Satan, and doe vtter the ſame in diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, according as that vncleane ſpirit taketh poſſeſſion in them, and by diuers obiects and meanes, allureth them to doe his will, ſome by ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſome by enuie, ſome by malice, and ſome by feare, and ſo forth: and this is the firſt worke.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he gathereth <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> to battell,
<note place="margin">Gog and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog.</note> in number like the ſand of the Sea, and ſo he and his inclined to battell and bloodſhed, haue migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie armies, and in number many, inflamed with crueltie. The ſpecial heads and rulers of their armies, or rather rankes of their confederats, to goe to battel and to fight, are twaine, here named <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog; Gog</hi> in Hebrew is called Hid, and <hi>Magog</hi> Reuealed, to ſignifie that in two ſorts of men chiefly Satan ſhall vtter himſelfe, <hi>to wit,</hi> hypocrites, and auowed or open enemies to God: It is ſaid then that Satan ſhall in the latter times rule a new ouer the world, who ſhall ſtirre vp the nations vnder the banners of theſe two enemies to God, the hypocriticall and open, to ſpread themſelues in great multitudes vpon the earth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they ſhall aſcend vpon the plaine of the earth, preſumptuouſly and proudly, bragging of their number and force, and thinking none ſhall be able to reſiſt their rage: They ſhall compaſſe and beſiege the campes of the Saints, and beloued Citie, that is, the handfull of the faithfull beloued of the Lord, againſt whome, truſting in their vntellable number, like the ſand of the ſea, they ſhall make a cruell and vnceſſable warre.</p>
                  <p>The elect are called Saints and beloued,
<note place="margin">The Elect are the Saints and beloued Citie of God.</note> becauſe they are in the loue of God ſelected and ſeuered out, and by grace engraffed in Chriſt, in whom they are counted and found iuſtified, ſanctified, worthy of loue and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe glorie: Their faithfull fellowſhip is compared to Tents, and to a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie beloued, to ſignifie their continuall warfare in the earth againſt Satan
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:23110:60"/>and ſinne, with all his inſtruments: their mutual amitie, and friendly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction in loue among themſelues, and ioyning together to maintaine the good cauſe that their God hath clad them with: but chiefly to ſignifie the mightie and al-ſufficient protection or defence in proſperity and aduerſity, flowing from God for their iuſt aide againſt all powers that can purſue, whereby they alſo become faire as the Moone, pure as the Sunne, terrible as an armie with banners, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.6, 9. Yea as a defenced Citie, and yron pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and wals of Braſſe againſt the whole earth, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 1.18.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme then of Satan his doing after he is looſed,
<note place="margin">The ſumme of Satan his doing after he is looſed.</note> is this: hee ſhall deceiue the nations: he ſhall gather an infinite number of hypocrites and open enemies together, inflamed with crueltie, and theſe ſhall in pridefull preſumption fiercely bend themſelues againſt the choſen of God, and his trewth profeſſed by them. But what at laſt ſhall the ſucceſſe be? ſurely moſt vnhappy: for fire ſhall come downe from heauen and deuoure them, and the diuell that deceiued them, and all his inſtruments, chiefly the Beaſt and falſe Prophet ſhall be caſt in a lake of fire and brimſtone,
<note place="margin">The vnhappy ſucceſſe of Satan.</note> and ſhall bee tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented day and night inceſſantly for euer and euer: that is, how greatly ſoeuer their brags be, how neere ſoeuer they ſhall appeare to be to obtaine their purpoſe, God from heauen, as the pallace and throne, wherefrom hee giueth proofe of his mercie towards his owne, and of his iuſtice toward his enemies, ſhall ſend plagues and deſtruction, as well ordinary, as extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie vpon them: Ordinarie, by reuealing their wickedneſſe by the thundring mouthes of trew paſtors, which is oft called fire in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Extraordinarie, by all corporall plagues to their vtter deſtruction, and vntellable torment for euer in the hels.

<note place="margin">The putitie of the Goſpel induring, ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</note> And firſt we muſt know what time theſe thouſand or many yeres was in, and when, and how Satan was looſed. This time is to be found in the ſixt Chapter, in the opening of the firſt three ſeales of the ſecret booke of God his prouidence by the Lambe, <hi>to wit,</hi> the time when the white, red, and blacke horſes had their courſe in the world: And to ſpeake more plainely, the Diuell his power did lurke, which is called his binding, and the Goſpel did flouriſh in a reaſonable puritie many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeeres after Chriſt, as the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories beare witneſſe: For in great puritie the Goſpel did continue long, which is ſignified by the courſe of the white horſe, albeit the profeſſors were vnder the croſſe ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the red horſe, and troubled wonderfully by heretickes, ſignified by the blacke horſe, by wormewood that fell in the Fountaines of waters in the third trumpet, and by waters that the dragon ſpewed out of his mouth, in the viſion of the Dragon and the woman, <hi>chap.</hi> 12. This time did endure
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:23110:60"/>from Chriſt a ſpace after <hi>Auguſtine</hi> his dayes, when the bloodie Sword of perſecution ceaſing, the whole Church began to be defiled with diuers he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, which comming vnto a mature and ripe heape, did produce or bring foorth the Antechriſt, ſignified by the pale horſe in the fourth ſeale, by the king of the Locuſts in the fift trumpet, by <hi>Babylon</hi> in the 11 and 18. Chapter, by the ſecond Beaſt riſing out of the ſea in the 13. Chapter, and by the woman clad with ſcarlet in the 17. chapter. The ariſings of the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and the Antichriſt breeding of their ſmoake, is in this place called the looſing of Satan.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth after this his looſing, what he doeth:
<note place="margin">The Goſpel being hid, the Antichriſt beginneth to breed &amp; tend to his height.</note> He deceiueth the nations vniuerſally: he gathereth <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> with vntellable armies to fight, he climeth vpon the plaine of the earth, he compaſſeth the tents of the Saints, and the beloued Citie about: Theſe are his doings.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe theſe actions are moſt liuely declared in other places of the ſame booke, I will ſhortly alleadge them to make the matter cleere by conference of places, expounding euery one another. It is ſaid in the ninth chapter, that the Antichriſt ſhall ſend out his locuſts or Eccleſiaſticall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by faire allurements to entice the world, to yeeld to his and their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable hereſies, and ſhall preuaile ouer the moſt part. It is ſaid in the 11. chapter, that he ſhall perſecute the Saints, kill the two witneſſes, and ſhall reioyce with the kings of the earth, for their killing, as hauing beene the onely lets to his full glory. It is ſaid in the 13. chapter, that he ſhall blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme God in vſurping his power, that by the aduice and aſſiſtance of the falſe Prophet, or falſe Church, hee ſhall ſend out his Images or Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours through the world, perſecuting and deſtroying them that will not obey him and them, and acknowledge his ſupremacie; yea, none ſhall be ſuffered to buy or ſell, or vſe ciuill ſocietie, that acknowledgeth not his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power and dignity. It is ſaid in the 16. chapter, that God plaguing him for theſe foreſaid abuſes, he ſhall be ſo farre from repentance, as by the contrarie he ſhall finde out a new ſort of vermin, that is, a new Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call order, which are called their frogges, who ſhall mooue and entice the Princes of the earth to ioyne with him, and make warre againſt the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, preſſing vtterly to deſtroy them: and of that battell, and the end ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doeth this place make mention.</p>
                  <p>Now ſhortly ioyne all theſe together, and ſo obtaine the meaning. There ſhall ariſe an Antichriſt and enemie to God and his Church: hee ſhall bee head of a falſe and hypocriticall Church: hee ſhall claime a ſupreme power in earth: he ſhall vſurpe the power of God: he ſhall deceiue men with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing locuſts: he ſhall perſecute the faithfull: none ſhall bee found that dare openly reſiſt him: In the end, feeling his kingdome decay, and the trew Church beginning to proſper, he ſhall by a new ſort of deceiuing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, gather together the Kings of the earth in great multitudes like the ſands of the Sea, and by ioyning or at leaſt ſuffering of that other great open enemy, he ſhall with theſe numbers compaſſe the campes of the faithfull,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:23110:61"/>beſiege the beloued Citie, make warre againſt the Saints: but victorie ſhal he not haue, and ſhame and confuſion ſhalbe his, and all his partakers end.</p>
                  <p>Now whether the Pope beareth theſe markes or not,
<note place="margin">The Pope is Antichriſt, and Poperie the looſing of Satan, from whom procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt.</note> let any indifferent man iudge; I thinke ſurely it expounds it ſelfe: Doeth he not vſurpe Chriſt his office, calling himſelfe vniuerſall Biſhop and head of the Church? Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he not the part of <hi>Apollyon,</hi> and <hi>Abaddon</hi> the king of the Locuſts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer, or ſonne of perdition, in chopping and changing of ſoules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt heauen, hell, and his fantaſticke or imagined purgatorie at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?

Hath hee not ſo fully ruled ouer the world theſe many hundreth yeeres, as to the fire went hee, whoſoeuer hee was, that durſt deny any part of his vſurped ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie? And hath he not of late dayes, ſeeing his kingdome going to decay,

And whereas the open enemie of God, the Turke was vnder bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy warres with him euer before, is there not of late a truce among them, that the faithfull may be the more eaſily rooted out? And are not the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies preſently aſſembled, yea vpon the very point of their execution in <hi>France</hi> againſt the Saints there? In <hi>Flanders</hi> for the like; and in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> by whom already the Biſhop of <hi>Collein</hi> is diſplaced?

This his malice is notably laid foorth in the 12. and 13.

                  <p>To conclude then with exhortation: It is al our duties in this Iſle at this time, to do two things: One, to conſider our eſtate: And other to conforme our actions according thereunto: Our eſtate is, we are threefold beſieged: Firſt, ſpiritually by the hereſies of the antichriſt: Secondly, corporally &amp; ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, as members of that Church, the which in the whole they perſecute: Thirdly,
<note place="margin">All men ſhould be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully armed ſpiritually and bodily to fight againſt the Antichriſt, and his vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> corporally and particularly by this preſent armie. Our actions then conformed to our eſtate are theſe: Firſt, to call for helpe at God his hands: Next, to aſſure vs of the ſame, ſeeing we haue a ſufficient warrant, his conſtant promiſe expreſſed in his word: Thirdly, ſince with good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we may, being in the tents of the Saints, &amp; beloued City, ſtand in our defence, encourage one another to vſe lawfull reſiſtance, and concurre or ioyne one with another as warriors in one Campe, and citizens of one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued City, for maintenance of the good cauſe God hath clad vs with, and in defence of our liberties, natiue countrey, and liues: For ſince we ſee God hath promiſed not only in the world to come, but alſo in this world, to giue vs victory ouer them, let vs in aſſurance hereof ſtrongly truſt in our God, ceaſe to miſtruſt his promiſe, and fall through incredulitie or vnbeliefe: For then are we worthy of double puniſhment: For the ſtronger they waxe, and the neerer they come to their light, the faſter approcheth their wracke, and the day of our deliuery: For kind, and louing, true, and conſtant, carefull, and watchfull, mighty, and reuenging is he that promiſeth it: To whom be praiſe and glory for euer.

                     <head>THE FIRST PART.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S to the firſt part;
<note place="margin">Zeale in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Gods kindneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, moued Dauid to honour God.</note> The cauſes moouing <hi>Dauid,</hi> paſſing all others, I note two: One internall, the other, external: the internall was a feruent and zealous mind in <hi>Dauid</hi> fully diſpoſed to extoll the glorie of God that had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to be King, as he ſaith himſelfe. The zeale of thy houſe it eats me vp, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.9. But more largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the 132. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> compoſed at the ſame time while this worke was a doing. The externall was a notable victorie newly obtained by the power of God ouer and againſt the Philiſtines, olde and pernitious enemies to the people of God, expreſſed in the laſt part of the 14. chapter preceding. By this victorie or cauſe externall, the internal cauſes and zeale in <hi>Dauid</hi> is ſo doubly inflamed, that all things ſet aſide, in this worke onely he will be occupied. Theſe are the two weightie cauſes mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him. Wherof we may learne, firſt that the chiefe vertue which ſhould be in a chriſtian Prince, and which the Spirit of God alwayes chiefly prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in him, is a feruencie and conſtant zeale to promote the glorie of God, that hath honoured him. Next, that where this zeale is vnfained, God leaues neuer that perſon, without continuall powring of his bleſſings on him, thereby to ſtirre vp into him a double meaſure of zeale and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards God.
<note place="margin">The Church euer troubled by men, hath a ioyfull end.</note> Thirdly, that the Church of God neuer wanted ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and notable victories ouer them, to aſſure them at all times of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant kindnes of God towards them; euen, when as by the croſſe, as a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter medicine, he cureth their infirmities, ſaueth them from groſſe ſinnes, and trieth their faith: For we find plainely in the Scriptures, that no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:23110:63"/>God himſelfe chooſed Iſrael to be his people; but aſſoone, &amp; euer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after as long as they remained his, the diuell ſo enuied their proſperity, as hee hounded out his inſtruments the nations, at all times to trouble and warre againſt them, yet to the comfort of his Church afflicted, and wrack of the afflicters in the end. This firſt was practiſed by <hi>Pharao</hi> in Egypt: and after their deliuerance, firſt by the Ammonites, and then by the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines continually thereafter, vntill the riſing of the Monarchies, who euery one did exerciſe themſelues in the ſame labour. But to note here the rage of all prophane Princes and nations which exerciſed their crueltie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church of God, were ſuperfluous and tedious, in reſpect of that which I haue ſet downe in my former meditation: Wherefore I onely goe forward then in this. As this was the continuall behauiour of the Nations towards Iſrael; So it was moſt eſpecially in the time of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and among the reſt at this time here cited; at what time hauing newly inuaded Iſrael, and beeing driuen backe, they would yet aſſemble againe in great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to warre againſt the people of God, and not content to defend their owne countries as the Iſraelites did, would needes come out of the ſame to purſue them, and ſo ſpread themſelues in the valley: But <hi>Dauid</hi> by Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, brings foorth the people againſt them, who fights, and according to Gods promiſes, ouercomes them, onely by the hand of God, and not by their power, as the place it ſelfe moſt plainely doeth ſhew: So the Church of God may be troubled, but in trouble it cannot periſh; and the end of their trouble is the very wracke and deſtruction of Gods enemies.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow followes ſecondly the perſons who did concurre with <hi>Dauid</hi> in this action:
<note place="margin">Three rankes of perſons concurre with Dauid in this worke.</note> The Spirit noteth three rankes of them. In the firſt are the Elders of Iſrael: In the next, are the captaines ouer thouſands: In the third; are the Prieſts and Leuites, of whom ſummarily I will ſpeake. Theſe Elders were ſubſtituted vnder <hi>Dauid</hi> in the kingdome, and as his hands in all parts of the countrey miniſtring iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and iudgement to the Kings ſubiects: And they were of two ſorts, maieſtrates in walled townes, who in the gates of the cities executed iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and chiefe in Tribes, and fathers of families, who in the countrey did iudge and miniſter iudgement as the Scripture reports: They were not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to two of the eſtates of our kingdome, the Baron and the Burgeſſe. The Captaines ouer thouſands were godly and valiant men, who vnder the King did rule in time of warre, had the cuſtodie of the Kings perſon, and fought his battailes: Theſe were neceſſarie officers for <hi>Dauid,</hi> who was appointed by God in his time (as wee are taught out of Gods owne words, ſpeaking by <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>Dauid</hi>) to fight Gods battailes, to ſubdue the enemies of his Church, and to procure by ſo doing, a peaceable kingdome
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:23110:64"/>for <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſonne, who ſhould in peace, as a figure of Chriſt the Prince of peace, build the Lords Temple. Theſe are ſpoken of here, to teach vs, firſt, that their calling is lawfull: next, that in their calling, they ſhould be earneſt to honour God: and thirdly, that theſe Captaines chiefly were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called, and lawfully walked therein, as we haue plaine declaration out of <hi>Dauids</hi> owne mouth, expreſſed well in the whole 101. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> ſeeing none were admitted in his ſeruice or houſhold, but ſuch as vnfainedly fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God. And without all queſtion, godly and zealous <hi>Dauid</hi> would neuer haue committed the guard of his perſon, nor the fighting of Gods battailes to the enemies of God, or men of warre, of whoſe godlineſſe and vertue he neuer had proofe: See then their names and praiſe, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.26. The third ranke of Prieſts and Leuites are ſet downe in the ſame chapter, verſ. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. So men of all eſtates were preſent in this godly worke. This is to be marked well of Princes, and of all thoſe of any high calling or degree that hath to doe in Gods cauſe. <hi>Dauid</hi> doth nothing in matters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to God without the preſence and ſpeciall concurrence of Gods Miniſters, appointed to be ſpirituall rulers in his Church: and at the firſt meant to conuey the ſame Arke to Ieruſalem, finding their abſence and want of their counſell hurtfull: now in this chapter, verſ. 12, 13. he ſaith to them, <hi>Ye are the chiefe Fathers of the Leuites, ſanctifie your ſelues and your brethren, and bring vp the Arke of the Lord God of Iſrael vnto the place that I haue prepared for it. For becauſe ye were not there at the firſt, the Lord our God made a breach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs: for we ſought him not in due order.</hi> And thus farre for the ſecond part concerning perſons: Wherein we may learne, firſt, that a godly king findes, as his heart wiſheth, godly eſtates concurring with him. Next a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly king of his godly foreſight in chooſing good vnder-rulers, reapeth this profit and pleaſure, that as hee goeth before, ſo they with zealous hearts doe follow.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſumme of this ioyfull conuoy may be digeſted in three actions,
<note place="margin">The Arke is tranſported with ioy to Ieruſalem.</note> which are theſe: The tranſporting of the Arke; the harmony of muſicall inſtruments; and <hi>Dauids</hi> dancing and reioycing before it. He built a Tabernacle for the Arke in mount <hi>Sion,</hi> &amp; tranſported it therunto, to ſignify his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes for the many victories God had put in his hands: and this tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was the occaſion of all this ſolemnitie and reioycing that followed thereupon.
<note place="margin">The ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Arke of the Couenant.</note> As to the Arke it ſelfe, we know it was built by <hi>Moyſes</hi> at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand of God, in the wildernes of <hi>Sinai.</hi> This Arke was made of <hi>Shittim</hi> wood, which admits no corruption: It was of moſt comely ſhape and forme, two cubits and a halfe in length, a cubit and a halfe in height, and a cubit and a halfe in breadth, ouerlaid within and without with pure beaten gold, and was not only a figure of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> our perfect Sauiour, in whom
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:23110:64"/>all the promiſes of God, are yea and Amen, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.20. and in whom as a ſure Arke, all abundance of Gods bleſſings are placed, that out of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we may all receiue grace vpon grace, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.16. ſeeing he is made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs of God, wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemption, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.30. but alſo a ſure pledge of Gods continuall preſence in Chriſt with his people, to bleſſe them with all maner of bleſſings. And to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this purpoſe more particularly, within the Arke was placed the Tables of the Couenant, and Law written by God, (for which cauſe alſo it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Arke of the Couenant) <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. to teach them in Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, the perfection of the whole Law to be found, for all that beleeue in him. Aboue the Arke was a couer or lid called The Mercie Seate, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the lid the figures of two Cherubins, couering with their wings the Mercie Seat: betwixt the which two, the liuing God did louingly ſpeake to the inſtruction and comfort of his people, to aſſure them that all Gods mercifull dealings with man (either in communicating his knowledge to them: or in ſending his Angels miniſtring Spirits for their comfort,)
<note place="margin">Heb. 1.14. Ioh. 1.4, 11.</note> hath the ground and foundation in CHRIST IESVS eternally. This Arke then being a ſure Sacrament of Gods fauour towards them, and a Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of IESVS CHRIST, wherein corporally Gods mercifull promiſes did inſue; followes the third part, the forme of doing vſed therein by theſe perſons. Generally, the action was to bring vp the Arke of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of the Lord, from the houſe of <hi>Obed Edom</hi> with ioy, and to be placed in the Tabernacle built for it by the King in Mount <hi>Sion.</hi> The forme of doing vſed by euery perſon, is: The Prieſts offer Bullocks and Rammes, becauſe that God bleſſed the worke; The King clad in a linnen garment, dances and playes before the Arke: <hi>Chenaniah</hi> the chiefe of the ſingers with his fellowes, praiſes God with Pſalmes, and all the eſtates in Iſrael, bring the Arke of the Couenant with ſhowting, ſound of Cornet, Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, cymbals, violes, and harpes, and place it in the citie of Dauid. Briefly then, <hi>Dauid</hi> vpon his victories doeth tranſport to his houſe the ſame, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie hereby his care to receiue Gods fauour towards him and his people: Not thinking it enough to haue once or twiſe proofe thereof; but alſo to procure a continuance by the preſence of his holy Arke, eſteeming this the worthieſt trophee or triumph, he could make or erect for his notable victories: A triumph indeed farre ſurpaſsing the Egyptian Piramides, the Grecian trophees, or yet the Romane triumphall chariots. As to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie and muſicall inſtruments that accompanied this holy Arke, I truſt no man is ignorant of the cuſtome that was among the Iewes, in praiſing. God with all kind of inſtruments, as <hi>Dauids</hi> Pſalmes innumerable times beare witneſſe. But in caſe ſome would demand wherefore the Church of God ſhould more extraordinarily reioyce at one time, then at another, ſeeing we are aſſured that all Gods actions towards vs, are for our weale, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpiritually or corporally, ſuppoſe wee cannot at euery time compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it: I anſwere, that although I muſt confeſſe that ſentence to bee moſt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:23110:65"/>orthodoxe, yet muſt I alſo confeſſe, that whenſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe God to manifeſt by outward ſignes to the world, as at one time more then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the great loue to his Church, by ſome notable worke for their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; We are then of duty bound in the higheſt degree to praiſe God, as well for confirming of the weake ones amongſt vs, as for ſtopping of the mouthes, and daſhing of the proud wicked without vs, to make the glory of his Name, as farre as in vs lieth, to reſound: The manifold examples of the Saints of God through the whole Scriptures prooue this more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently, beſides the examples of the prayers of ſundry of the godly, who for the glory of his Name, more then for their particular weale, haue pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to giue publike teſtimonie of his loue towards them: So did <hi>Moſes, Ioſhua, Dauid, Elias, Elizeus,</hi> and innumerable others of the Prophets and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God. As to the dancing of <hi>Dauid:</hi> dancing, playing, and ſuch like actions we know are of themſelues indifferent, and good or euil accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their vſe, and the intention of the vſer; and therefore being vſed at this time with a comely zeale, for the ſetting foorth of Gods glory, are not onely to be borne with and excuſed, but euen moſt highly to be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and commended, although that <hi>Michal</hi> diſprayſed the ſame. Moreouer, it is to be marked that <hi>Dauid</hi> in this doing, did nothing without the ſpecial motion of the ſpirit of God, as an extraordinarie worke, which ſo fully poſſeſſed his ſoule at this preſent, that forgetfull, as it were, of the actions of his bodie; hee gaue his whole perſon ouer to be gouerned as it pleaſed him, alwayes ſeeking in all, the honour and glorie of his God, without reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to himſelfe:
<note place="margin">Chriſt is the ground of all true Religion.</note> And thus farre for the third part: Whereof wee haue to note firſt in the Arke: The ground of all true and ancient religion, and the body of the whole ſeruice of God that brings ſaluation, is to bee ſituate in Ieſus Chriſt onely, as is plainely ſet downe, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.6. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.7. Next, that they which will be ſaued by this Arke, muſt beare this Arke in their heart by faith, in their mouth by open confeſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. and in their actions confirming their whole doing in their calling to his will, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23. Thirdly, that they who are ſincerely ioyned with Chriſt, reioyce in the bearing of Chriſt, and count it their higheſt ioy to be occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied continually in his bearing.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Er doings are, being quiet in her lodging,
<note place="margin">Michals do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> al the time of her huſbands great and publike reioycing with the people not comming out; for not being able, as appeareth, to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit finely euough a diſſimulate ioyfull countenance: And therefore looking out at a window, ſhee ſpies her husband dancing before the Arke, incontinent interprets ſhee this indifferent action <hi>in malam partem,</hi> as not being touched with a true feeling of the cauſe of his ioy, and ſo deſpiſes ſhe his doing in her minde, as onely proceeding of a laſciuious wantonneſſe. A marueilous caſe; ſhee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of naturall loue to her husband did preſerue him, although to her owne great perill, from the hands of her owne father <hi>Saul,</hi> cannot now abide to ſee him vſe aright that indifferent action, which ſhe her ſelfe (I doubt not) did oft through licentiouſnes abuſe. By this we may note the nature of the hypocrites, and interiour enemies of the Church, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in their particulars not concerning Religion, there will be none in ſhew more friendly to the godly then they; yet how ſoone matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or concerning the honour of God, comes in hand, O then are they no longer able to containe or bridle their paſſions, euen as here <hi>Michal</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended her husband, euen in the particulars betwixt him and her owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but his dancing before the Arke to the honour of God ſhe could no wiſe abide.</p>
                     <p>Now thus farre being ſaid for the methodicall opening vp of the Text;
<note place="margin">The applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the purpoſe to vs.</note> It reſts onely to examine how pertinently this place doeth appertaine to vs and our preſent eſtate: And firſt as to the perſons, the people of God and the nations their enemies, together with their pridefull purſuite of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and Gods moſt notable deliuerance. Is there not now a ſincere profeſſion of the trewth amongſt vs in this Iſle, oppugned by the nations about, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the holy word? And doe we not alſo as Iſrael, profeſſe one onely God, and are ruled by his pure word onely? on the other part, are they not as Philiſtines, adorers of legions of gods, and ruled by the fooliſh traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men? Haue they not as the Philiſtines, beene continually the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuers, and we as Iſrael the defenders of our natiue ſoile and countrey? next, haue they not now at the laſt euen like the Philiſtines, come out of their owne ſoiles to purſue vs, and ſpread themſelues to that effect vpon the great valley of our ſeas, preſumptuouſly threatning the deſtruction and wracke of vs? But thirdly, had not our victory beene farre more notable then that of Iſrael, and hath not the one beene as well wrought by the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:23110:66"/>hand of God, as the other? For as God by ſhaking the tops of the mulbery trees with his mightie windes, put the Philiſtines to flight, hath hee not euen in like maner by brangling with his mightie windes their timber ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſcattered and ſhaken them aſunder to the wracke of a great part, and confuſion of the whole? Now that we may reſemble Iſrael as well in the reſt of this action, what triumph reſts vs to make for the crowning of this bleſſed comedy? Euen to bring amongſt vs the Arke with all reioycing. What is the Arke of Chriſtians vnder grace, but the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whom with ioy wee bring amongſt vs, when as receiuing with ſinceritie and gladneſſe the new Teſtament in the blood of Chriſt our Sauiour, in our heart we beleeue his promiſes, and in word and deede wee beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereto before the whole world, and walke ſo in the light as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the ſonnes of the ſame? this is the worthieſt triumph of our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that we can make. And although there will doubtleſſe be many <hi>Michals</hi> amongſt vs, let vs reioyce and praiſe God for the diſcouerie of them, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our ſelues they were neuer of vs, accounting all them to be againſt vs, that either reioyce at the proſperitie of our enemies, or reioyce not with vs at our miraculous deliuerance: For all they that gather not with vs, they ſcatter. And let vs alſo diligently and warily trie out theſe craftie <hi>Michals:</hi> for it is in that reſpect that Chriſt recommends vnto vs the wiſedome of Serpents, not thereby to deceiue and betray others (no, God forbid) but to arme vs againſt the deceit and treaſon of hypocrites that goe about to trap vs. And leſt that theſe great benefits which God hath beſtowed vpon vs, be turned through our vnthankfulneſſe into a greater curſe, in ſeruing for teſtimonies at the latter day againſt vs, to the procuring of our double ſtripes; let vs now to conclude, bring in the Arke amongſt vs in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects before mentioned, ſeeing we haue already receiued the Goſpel; firſt by conſtant remaining in the puritie of the trewth, which is our moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine couenant of ſaluation in the only merits of our Sauior: And next, let vs ſo reforme our defiled liues, as becomes regenerate Chriſtians, to the great glory of our God, the vtter defacing of our aduerſaries the wicked, and our vnſpeakeable comfort both here and alſo for euer. AMEN.</p>

               <head>¶ THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He fearefull abounding at this time in this Countrey, of theſe detestable ſlaues of the Diuel, the Witches or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunters, hath mooued mee (beloued Reader) to diſpatch in poſt, this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe of mine, not in any wiſe (as J protest) to ſerue for a ſhew of my learning and ingine, but onely (moued of conſcience) to preaſſe thereby, ſo farre as I can, to reſolue the doubting hearts of many; both that ſuch aſſaults of Satan are moſt certainely practiſed, and that the instruments thereof, merits most ſeuerely to be puniſhed: againſt the damnable opinions of two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in our aage, whereof the one called <hi>Scot,</hi> an Engliſhman, is not aſhamed in publike Print to deny, that there can be ſuch a
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:23110:68"/>thing as Witch-craft: and ſo maintaines the old errour of the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in denying of ſpirits; The other called <hi>Wierus,</hi> a German Phyſition, ſets out a publike Apologie for all theſe craftſ-folkes, whereby, procuring for their impunitie, he plainely bewrayes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to haue bene one of that profeſsion. And for to make this Treatiſe the more pleaſant and facill, J haue put it in forme of a Dialogue, which I haue diuided into three Bookes: The first ſpeaking of Magie in generall, and Necromancie in ſpeciall: The ſecond, of Sorcerie and Witch-craft: and the third, containes a diſcourſe of all theſe kinds of ſpirits, and Spectres that appeares and troubles perſons, together with a concluſion of the whole worke. My intention in this labour, is onely to prooue two things, as I haue already ſaid: The one, that ſuch diueliſh artes haue bene and are: The other, what exact triall and ſeuere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment they merit: and therefore reaſon I, What kinde of things are poſsible to be performed in theſe Arts, and by what naturall cauſes they may be, not that I touch euery particular thing of the Diuels power, for that were infinite: but onely to ſpeake ſchola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtickely, (ſince this cannot be ſpoken in our language) J reaſon vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>genus</hi> leauing <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and <hi>differentia</hi> to bee comprehended therein: As for example, ſpeaking of the power of Magiciens, in the firſt booke and ſixt Chapter, I ſay, that they can ſuddenly cauſe be brought vnto them, all kinds of daintie diſhes, by their familiar ſpirit; ſince as a thiefe he delights to ſteale, and as a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit he can ſubtilly and ſuddenly ynough tranſport the ſame. Now vnder this <hi>genus,</hi> may be comprehended all particulars, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereupon; ſuch as the bringing Wine out of a wall (as wee haue heard oft to haue bene practiſed) and ſuch others; which particulars, are ſufficiently prooued by the reaſons of the generall. And ſuch like in the ſecond booke of Witch-craft in ſpeciall, and fift Chapter, J ſay, and proue by diuers Arguments, that Witches can by the power of their master, cure or cast on diſeaſes: Now by theſe ſame reaſons, that proues their power by the Diuell of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in generall, is aſwell proued their power in ſpecial; as of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the nature of ſome men, to make them vnable for women, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:23110:68"/>making it to abound in others, more then the ordinary courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would permit: And ſuch like in all other particular ſickneſses. But one thing I will pray thee to obſerue in all theſe places, where I reaſon vpon the diuels power, which is the different ends and ſcopes, that God as the firſt cauſe, and the diuell as his inſtrument and ſecond cauſe, ſhoots at in all theſe actions of the diuel, (as Gods hang-man:) For where the diuels intention in them is euer to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, either the ſoule, or the body, or both of them, that he is ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to deale with; God by the contrary, drawes euer out of that euill, glory to himſelfe, either by the wracke of the wicked in his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or by the triall of the patient, and amendment of the faithful, being wakened vp with that rod of correction. Hauing thus decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto thee then, my full intention in this Treatiſe, thou wilt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily excuſe, I doubt not, aſwel my pretermitting, to declare the whole particular rites and ſecrets of theſe vnlawfull arts; as alſo their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit and wonderfull practiſes, as being neither of them pertinent to my purpoſe: the reaſon whereof, is giuen in the hinder end of the first Chapter of the third booke: and who likes to be curious in theſe things, he may reade, if he will heare of their practiſes, <hi>Bodinus Daemonomanie,</hi> collected with greater diligence, then written with iudgement, together with their confeſsions, that haue been at this time apprehended. If he would know what hath bene the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Ancients, concerning their power, he ſhall ſee it well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by <hi>Hyperius</hi> &amp; <hi>Hemmingius,</hi> two late Germane wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; Beſides innumerable other neotericke Theologues, that write largely vpon that ſubject: And if he would know what are the particular rites, and curioſities of theſe blacke Arts (which is both vnneceſſary and perillous) he will finde it in the fourth Booke of <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> and in <hi>Wierus,</hi> whom-of J ſpake. And ſo wiſhing my paines in this Treatiſe (beloued Reader) to be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, in arming all them that reade the ſame, againſt theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue mentioned errours, and recommending my good will to thy friendly acceptation, J bid thee heartily fare-well.</p>

Next, what could be, or was raiſed? The ſpirit of <hi>Samuel?</hi> prophane, and againſt all Theologie: the deuill in his likeneſſe? as vnap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peirant, that either God would permit him to come in the ſhape of his Saints, (for then could neuer the Prophets in thoſe dayes haue beene ſure, what ſpirit ſpake to them in their viſions) or then that he could fore-tell what was to come thereafter; for Prophecie proceedeth onely of GOD: and the diuell hath no knowledge of things to come.</p>

                     <p>Yet if ye will marke the words of the text, yee will finde clearely, that <hi>Saul</hi> ſaw that apparition: for giuing you that <hi>Saul</hi> was in another chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, at the making of the circles and coniurations, needfull for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (as none of that craft wil permit any others to behold at that time) yet it is euident by the text, that how ſoone that once that vncleane ſpirit was fully riſen, ſhe called in vpon <hi>Saul:</hi> For it is ſaid in the text, that <hi>Saul knew him to be Samuel,</hi> which could not haue beene, by the hearing tell onely of an olde man with a mantill, ſince there was many moe old men dead in <hi>Iſrael</hi> nor <hi>Samuel:</hi> And the common weid of that whole countrey was mantils.

And that the deuill is permitted at
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:23110:70"/>ſometimes to put himſelfe in the likeneſſe of the Saints, it is plaine in the Scriptures,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.14.</note> where it is ſaid, that <hi>Satan can transforme himſelfe into an Angel of light.</hi> Neither could that bring any inconuenience with the viſions of the Prophets, ſince it is moſt certaine, that God will not permit him ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his owne: but onely ſuch, as firſt wilfully deceiue them-ſelues, by running vnto him, whom God then ſuffers to fall in their owne ſnares, and iuſtly permits them to be illuded with great efficacie of deceit, becauſe they would not beleeue the trueth (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth.) And as to the diuels foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of things to come, it is true that he knowes not all things future; but yet that hee knowes part, the tragicall euent of this hiſtorie declares it, (which the wit of woman could neuer haue fore-ſpoken) not that hee hath any preſcience, which is onely proper to God; or yet knowes any thing by looking vpon God, as in a mirrour (as the good Angels doe) hee being for euer debarred from the fauourable preſence and countenance of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, but onely by one of theſe two meanes: either, as being worldly wiſe, and taught by a continuall experience, euer ſince the Creation, iudges by likelyhood of things to come, according to the like that hath paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the naturall cauſes, in reſpect of the viciſſitude of all things world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: or elſe by Gods imploying of him in a turne, and ſo foreſeene thereof, as appeares to haue beene in this,
<note place="margin">1.

<note place="margin">Exod. 22.</note> it is plainely prohibited: But certaine it is, that the Law of God ſpeakes nothing in vaine, neither doeth it lay curſes, or enioyne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments vpon ſhadowes, condemning that to be ill, which is not in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or being,
<note place="margin">Exod. 7. &amp; 2.</note> as we call it. Secondly, it is plaine, where wicked <hi>Pharaobs</hi> Wiſe-men imitated a number of <hi>Moſes</hi> miracles, to harden the tyrants heart thereby. Thirdly, ſaid not <hi>Samuel</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> that <hi>diſobedience is as the ſinne of Witch-craft?</hi>

                        </gap>, that is to ſay, the law of the Starres: And this Art indeed is one of the members of the <hi>Mathematiques,</hi> and not onely lawfull, but moſt neceſſary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable: The other is called <hi>Astrologia,</hi> being compounded of <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, which is to ſay, the word and preaching of the Starres: Which is diuided into two parts: The firſt, by knowing thereby the powers of ſimples, and ſickneſſes, the courſe of the ſeaſons and the weather, being ruled by their influence; which part depending vpon the former, although it bee not of it ſelfe a part of <hi>Mathematiques:</hi> yet it is not vnlawfull, being moderately v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſuppoſe not ſo neceſſarie and commendable as the former. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part is to truſt ſo much to their influences, as thereby to foretell what common-weales ſhall flouriſh or decay: what perſons ſhall be fortunate or vnfortunate: what ſide ſhall winne in any battell: what man ſhal obtaine victorie at ſingular combate: what way, and of what aage ſhall men die: what horſe ſhall winne at match-running: and diuers ſuch like incredible things, wherein <hi>Cardanus, Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> and diuers others haue more curiouſly then profitably written at large. Of this roote laſt ſpoken of,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:23110:72"/>ſprings innumerable branches; ſuch as the knowledge by the natiuities; the <hi>Cheiromancie, Geomancie, Hydromancie, Arithmancie, Phyſiognomie,</hi> and a thouſand others, which were much practiſed, and holden in great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence by the Gentiles of old: And this laſt part of <hi>Aſtrologie</hi> whereof I haue ſpoken, which is the root of their branches, was called by them <hi>pars fortunae.</hi> This part now is vtterly vnlawfull to be truſted in, or practiſed amongſt Chriſtians, as leaning to no ground of naturall reaſon: and it is this part which I called before the Diuels ſchoole.</p>

                     <p>I thinke yee take me to be a Witch my ſelfe, or at the leaſt would faine ſweare your ſelfe prentiſe to that craft: Alwayes as I may, I ſhal ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfie you, in that kinde of coniurations, which are contained in ſuch bookes, which I call the Deuils Schoole: There are foure principall parts: the perſons of the coniurers; the action of the coniuration; the words and rites vſed to that effect; and the Spirits that are coniured. Ye muſt firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to lay the ground, that I tolde you before, which is, that it is no power inherent in the circles, or in the holineſſe of the names of God blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly vſed; nor in whatſoeuer rites or ceremonies at that time vſed, that either can raiſe any infernall ſpirit, or yet limitate him perforce with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in or without theſe circles. For it is he onely, the father of all lies, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing firſt of all preſcribed that forme of doing, feining himſelfe to be commanded and reſtrained thereby, will be loth to paſſe the boundes of theſe iniunctions; as wel thereby to make them glory in the impiring ouer him (as I ſaid before:) as likewiſe to make himſelfe ſo to be truſted in theſe little things, that he may haue the better commoditie thereafter, to deceiue them in the end with a tricke once for all; I meane the euerlaſting perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſoule and body. Then laying this ground, as I haue ſaid, theſe coniurations muſt haue fewe or moe in number of the perſons coniurers (alwayes paſſing the ſingular number) according to the qualitie of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and forme of apparition. Two principall things cannot well in that errand be wanted: holy-water (whereby the deuill mockes the <hi>Papiſts</hi>) and ſome preſent of a liuing thing vnto him. There are likewiſe certaine ſeaſons, dayes and houres, that they obſerue in this purpoſe: Theſe things being all ready and prepared, circles are made triangular, quadrangular, round, double or ſingle, according to the forme of apparition that they
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:23110:73"/>craue. But to ſpeake of the diuers formes of the circles, of the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble characters and croſſes that are within and without, and out-through the ſame, of the diuers formes of apparitions, that that craftie ſpirit illudes them with, and of all ſuch particulars in that action, I remit it to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many that haue buſied their heads in deſcribing of the ſame; as being but curious, and altogether vnprofitable. And this farre onely I touch, that when the coniured Spirit appeares, which will not be while after many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, long prayers, and much muttring and murmuring of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurers; like a <hi>Papist</hi> Prieſt, diſpatching a hunting <hi>Maſſe:</hi> how ſoone I ſay, he appeares, if they haue miſſed one iote of all their rites; or if any of their feet once ſlyde ouer the circle through terrour of his fearefull apparition, hee payes himſelfe at that time in his owne hand, of that due debt which they ought him; and otherwiſe would haue delayed longer to haue payed him: I meane, hee carries them with him body and ſoule. If this be not now a iuſt cauſe to make them weary of theſe formes of coniuration, I leaue it to you to iudge vpon, conſidering the long ſomneſſe of the labour, the preciſe keeping of dayes and houres (as I haue ſaid) the terribleneſſe of apparition, and the preſent perill that they ſtand in, in miſſing the leaſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance or freite, that they ought to obſerue: And on the other part, the deuill is glad to mooue them to a plaine and ſquare dealing with him, as I ſaid before.</p>

                     <p>From time that they once plainely begin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with him: The effect of their contract conſiſts in two things: in formes and effects, as I began to tell already, were it not ye interrupted me: (for although the contract be mutual, I ſpeake firſt of that part, wherein the diuel obliges himſelfe to them) By formes, I meane in what ſhape or faſhion he ſhall come vnto them, when they call vpon him; And by effects, I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, in what ſpeciall ſorts or ſeruices he binds himſelfe to bee ſubiect vnto them. The qualitie of theſe formes and effects, is leſſe or greater, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the skill and art of the <hi>Magician:</hi> For as to the formes, to ſome of the baſer ſort of them he obliges himſelfe to appeare at their calling vpon him, by ſuch a proper name which he ſhewes vnto them, either in likenes of a Dog, a Cat, an Ape, or ſuch-like other beaſt; or elſe to anſwere by a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:23110:74"/>voice onely. The effects, are to anſwere to ſuch demands, as concerne cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of diſeaſes, their owne particular menagerie, or ſuch other baſe things as they require of him. But to the moſt curious ſort, in the formes hee will oblige himſelfe, to enter into a dead bodie, and there out of to giue ſuch anſweres, of the euent of battels, of matters concerning the eſtate of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, and ſuch like other great queſtions: yea, to ſome he will bee a continuall attender, in forme of a Page: Hee will permit himſelfe to bee coniured, for the ſpace of ſo many yeeres, either in a tablet or a ring, or ſuch like thing, which they may eaſily cary about with them: Hee giues them power to ſell ſuch wares to others, whereof ſome will be dearer, and ſome better cheape, according to the lying or true ſpeaking of the Spirit that is coniured therein: Not but that in very deed, all deuils muſt be lyars; but ſo they abuſe the ſimplicitie of theſe wretches, that become their ſcholers, that they make them beleeue, that at the fall of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> ſome Spirits fell in the aire, ſome in the fire, ſome in the water, ſome in the land, in which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements they ſtill remaine. Whereupon they build, that ſuch as fell in the fire, or in the aire, are trewer then they, who fell in the water, or in the land, which are all but meere trattles, and forged by the authour of all deceite. For they fell not by weight, as a ſolide ſubſtance, to ſticke in any one part; but the principall part of their fall, conſiſting in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by the falling from the grace of God, wherein they were created, they continued ſtil thereafter, and ſhall doe while the latter day, in wandring through the world, as Gods hang-men, to execute ſuch turnes as hee employes them in: And when any of them are not occupied in that, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne they muſt to their priſon in hell (as it is plaine in the miracle that CHRIST wrought at <hi>Gennezareth</hi>) therein at the latter day to be all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed for euer:
<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> and as they deceiue their Schollers in this, ſo doe they, in imprinting in them the opinion, that there are ſo many Princes, Dukes, and Kings amongſt them, euery one commanding fewer or moe Legions, and impiring in diuers artes, and quarters of the earth: For though that I will not deny that there be a forme of order amongſt the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and conſequently, was amongſt them before their fall; yet, either that they bruike the ſame ſenſine; or that God will permit vs to know by dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diuels, ſuch heauenly myſteries of his, which he would not reueale to vs, neither by Scripture nor Prophets, I thinke no Chriſtian will once thinke it. But by the contrary of all ſuch myſteries, as he hath cloſed vp with his Seale of ſecrecie; it becommeth vs to be contented with an humble ignorance, they being things not neceſſary for our ſaluation. But to returne to the purpoſe, as theſe formes, wherein Satan obliges himſelfe to the greateſt of the <hi>Magicians,</hi> are wonderfull curious; ſo are the effects correſpondent vnto the ſame: For he will oblige himſelfe to teach them artes and ſciences, which he may eaſily doe, being ſo learned a knaue as he is, to carry them newes from any part of the world, which the agilitie of a Spirit may eaſily performe: to reueale to them the ſecrets of any perſons,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:23110:74"/>ſo being they be once ſpoken, for the thought none knowes but GOD; except ſo farre as ye may gheſſe by their countenance, as one who is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly learned enough in the <hi>Phyſiognomie:</hi> Yea, hee will make his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to creepe in credite with Princes, by fore-telling them many great things; part true, part falſe: For if all were falſe, hee would tyne credite at all handes; but alwayes doubtſome, as his Oracles were. And he will alſo make them to pleaſe Princes, by faire banquets and daintie diſhes, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in ſhort ſpace fra the fartheſt part of the world: For no man doubts but he is a thiefe, and his agilitie (as I ſpake before) makes him to come with ſuch ſpeed. Such like, he wil guard his Schollers with faire armies of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and footmen in appearance, Caſtles and forts, Which all are but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the aire, eaſily gathered by a Spirit, drawing ſo neere to that ſubſtance himſelfe: As in like maner he will learne them many Iuglarie trickes at Cardes, dice, and ſuch like, to deceiue mens ſenſes thereby, and ſuch innumerable falſe practiques, which are proued by ouer-many in this aage; as they who are acquainted with that <hi>Italian</hi> called SCOTO yet liuing, can report: And yet are all theſe things but deluding of the ſenſes, and no wayes true in ſubſtance; as were the falſe miracles wrought by King <hi>Pharaos</hi> Magicians, for counterfeiting <hi>Moyſes:</hi> For that is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt GODS miracles and the diuels, GOD is a creatour, what he makes appeare in myracle, it is ſo in effect: As <hi>Moyſes</hi> Rod being caſten downe, was no doubt turned into a naturall Serpent: where as the diuel (as Gods Ape) counterfetting that by his <hi>Magicians,</hi> made their wandes to appeare ſo, onely to mens outward ſenſes: as kythed in effect by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deuoured by the other; For it is no wonder, that the diuel may delude our ſenſes, ſince we ſee by common proofe, that ſimple Iugglars wil make an hundreth things ſeeme both to our eyes and eares otherwayes then they are.

As to the other reaſon, which ſeemes to be of greater weight, if it were formed in a Syllogiſme; it behooued to be in many termes, and full of fallacies (to ſpeake in termes of <hi>Logicque:</hi>) for firſt, that that generall propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, affirming <hi>Moyſes</hi> to be taught <hi>in all the ſciences of the Egyptians,</hi> ſhould conclude that he was taught in <hi>Magie,</hi> I ſee no neceſſitie: For we muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the Spirit of God there, ſpeaking of ſciences, vnderſtands them that are lawfull; for except they be lawfull, they are but <hi>abuſiuè</hi> called ſciences, and are but ignorances, indeed: <hi>Nam homo pictus, nonest homo.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, giuing that he had beene taught in it, there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt knowledge and practiſing of a thing, as I ſaid before: For God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things, being alwaies good, and of our ſinne and our infirmitie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth our ignorance. Thirdly, giuing that he had both ſtudied and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed the ſame (which is more then monſtrous to bee beleeued by any Chriſtian) yet we know well inough, that before that euer the Spirit of God began to call <hi>Moyſes,</hi> he was fled out of Egypt, being fourtie yeeres of aage, for the ſlaughter of an Egyptian, and in his good father <hi>Iethroes</hi> land,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:23110:75"/>firſt called at the fierie buſh, hauing remained there other fourtie yeeres in exile: ſo that ſuppoſe hee had beene the wickeddeſt man in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he then became a changed and regenerate man, and very little of olde <hi>Moyſes</hi> remained in him. <hi>Abraham</hi> was an Idolater in <hi>Vr</hi> of <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> before he was called: And <hi>Paul</hi> beeing called <hi>Saul,</hi> was a moſt ſharpe perſecutour of the Saints of God, while that name was changed.</p>

For firſt, whereas the Scripture ſeemes to prooue <hi>Witchcraft</hi> to bee, by diuers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and ſpecially by fundrie of the ſame, which ye haue alleaged; it is thought by ſome, that theſe places ſpeake of <hi>Magicians</hi> and <hi>Necromancers</hi> onely, and not of <hi>Witches:</hi> As in ſpeciall, theſe wiſe men of <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> that counterfeited <hi>Moyſes</hi> myracles, were <hi>Magicians</hi> ſay they, and not <hi>Witches:</hi> As likewiſe that <hi>Pythoniſſe</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> conſulted with: And ſo was <hi>Simon Magus</hi> in the new Teſtament, as that very ſtile imports. Secondly, where ye would oppone the dayly practicque, and confeſſion of ſo many, that is thought likewiſe to be but very Melancholicque imaginations of ſimple rauing creatures.

                     <p>Your three reaſons, as I take, are grounded: the firſt of them <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuè</hi> vpon the Scripture: The ſecond <hi>affirmatiuè</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Phiſick: And the third vpon the certaine proofe of experience. As to your firſt, it is moſt trew indeede, that all theſe wiſe men of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> were <hi>Magicians</hi> of arte: As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it appeares well, that the <hi>Pythoniſſe,</hi> with whom <hi>Saul</hi> conſulted, was of that ſame profeſſion: and ſo was <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> But ye omitted to ſpeake of the Lawe of God, wherein are all <hi>Magicians,</hi> Diuiners, Enchanters, Sorcerers, Witches, and whatſoeuer of that kind that conſult with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, plainely prohibited, and alike threatned againſt. And beſides that, ſhe who had the Spirit of <hi>Python,</hi> in the Actes,
<note place="margin">Acts 16.</note> whoſe Spirit was put to ſilence by the Apoſtle, could be no other thing but a very Sorcerer or Witch, if ye admit the vulgar diſtinction, to be in a maner trew, whereof I ſpake in the beginning of our conference: For that ſpirit whereby ſhe conqueſted ſuch gaine to her Maſters, was not at her raiſing or commanding, as ſhee pleaſed to appoint, but ſpake by her tongue, as well publikely as priuately: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe ſeemed to draw nearer to the ſort of <hi>Demoniakes</hi> or poſſeſſed, if that coniunction betwixt them, had not beene of her owne conſent; as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by her, not being tormented therewith, and by her conqueſting of ſuch gaine to her Maſters (as I haue alreadie ſaid.) As to your ſecond reaſon grounded vpon Phyſicke, in attributing their confeſſions or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, to a naturall melancholique humour, any that pleaſe phyſically to conſider vpon the naturall humour of melancholly, according to all the Phyſicians, that euer writ thereupon, they ſhall find that that will be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhort a cloake to couer their knauery with: For as the humour of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly in the ſelfe is blacke, heauie and terrene, ſo are the ſymptomes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in any perſons that are ſubiect thereunto, leanneſſe, paleneſſe, deſire of ſolitude, and if they come to the higheſt degree thereof, meere folly and <hi>Manie:</hi> whereas by the contrary, a great number of them that euer haue beene conuict or confeſſours of Witchcraft, as may be preſently ſeene by many that haue at this time confeſſed; they are by the contrary, I ſay, ſome of them rich and worldly wiſe, ſome of them fat or corpulent in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and moſt part of them altogether giuen ouer to the pleaſures of the fleſh, continuall haunting of companie, and all kinde of merrineſſe, both lawfull and vnlawful, which are things directly contrary to the ſymptomes of melancholly, whereof I ſpake; and further experience daily prooues, how loth they are to confeſſe without torture, which witneſſeth their guiltineſſe; where by the contrary, the Melancholiques neuer ſpare to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray themſelues, by their continuall diſcourſes, feeding thereby their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in that which they thinke no crime. As to your third reaſon, it ſcarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merits an anſwere: for if the deuill their maſter were not bridled, as the Scriptures teach vs, ſuppoſe there were no men nor women to bee his inſtruments, he could finde wayes enough without any helpe of others to wracke all mankinde; whereunto he employes his whole ſtudy, and <hi>goeth about like a roaring Lyon</hi> (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth) to that effect, but the limits of his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:23110:77"/>power were ſet downe before the foundations of the world were laide, which he hath not power in the leaſtiote to tranſgreſſe. But beſide all this, there is ouer great a certaintie to prooue that they are, by the daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the harmes that they doe, both to men, and whatſoeuer thing men poſſeſſe, whom God will permit them to be the inſtruments, ſo to trouble or viſite, as in my diſcourſe of that arte, ye ſhall heare clearely prooued.</p>

                     <p>This word of <hi>Sorcerie</hi> is a Latine word, which is taken from caſting of the lot, and therefore he that vſeth it, is called <hi>Sortiarius à ſorte:</hi> As to the word of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> it is nothing but a proper name giuen in our language: The cauſe wherefore they were called <hi>Sortiarij,</hi> proceeded of their practiques, ſeeming to come of lot or chance, ſuch as the turning of the riddle, the knowing of the forme of prayers, or ſuch like tokens, if a perſon diſeaſed would liue or die: And in generall, that name was giuen them for vſing of ſuch charmes, and freits, as that Craft teacheth them. Many points of their craft and practicques are common betwixt the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> and them: for they ſerue both one Maſter, although in diuers faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And as I deuided the <hi>Necromancers</hi> into two ſortes, learned and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned; ſo muſt I deny them in other two, rich and of better accompt; poore and of baſer degree. Theſe two degrees now of perſons, that practiſe this Craft, anſwere to the paſſions in them, which (I tolde you before) the Diuell vſed as meanes to entice them to his ſeruice: for ſuch of them as are in great miſerie and pouertie, he allures to follow him, by promiſing vnto them great riches, and worldly commoditie: Such as though rich, yet burne in a deſperate deſire of reuenge, he allures them by promiſes, to get their turne ſatisfied to their hearts contentment. It is to be noted now, that that olde and craftie enemie of ours, aſſailes none, though touched with any of theſe two extremities, except he firſt finde an entreſſe ready for him, either by the great ignorance of the perſon he deales with, ioyned with an euill life, or elſe by their careleſneſſe and contempt of God: And finding them in an vtter deſpaire, for one of theſe two former cauſes that I haue ſpoken of, he prepares the way by feeding them craftely in their humour, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them further and further with deſpaire, while hee finde the time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to diſcouer himſelfe vnto them: At which time, either vpon their wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſolitarie in the fieldes, or elſe lying panſing in their bed, but alwaies without the company of any other, hee either by a voyce, or in likeneſſe
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:23110:77"/>of a man inquires of them, what troubles them, and promiſeth them, a ſuddaine and certaine way of remedie, vpon condition on the other part, that they follow his aduiſe, and doe ſuch things as he will require of them: Their mindes being prepared before-hand, as I haue alreadie ſpoken, they eaſily agreed vnto that demand of his, and ſyne ſets an other tryiſt, where they may meete againe: At which time, before hee proceede any further with them, hee firſt perſwades them to addict themſelues to his ſeruice, which being eaſily obtained, he then diſcouers what he is vnto them, makes them to renounce their God and Baptiſme directly, and giues them his marke vpon ſome ſecret place of their bodie, which remaines ſoare vnhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, while his next meeting with them, and thereafter euer inſenſible, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be nipped or pricked by any, as is daily prooued, to giue them a proofe thereby, that as in that doing, he could hurt and heale them; ſo all their ill and well doing thereafter, muſt depend vpon him: And beſides that, the intolerable dolour that they feele in that place, where he hath mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them, ſerues to waken them, and not to let them reſt, while their next meeting againe: fearing leſt otherwaies they might either forget him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as new Prentiſes, and not well enough founded yet, in that fiendly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: or elſe remembring of that horrible promiſe they made him at their laſt meeting, they might skunner at the ſame, and preaſſe to call it backe. At their third meeting, he makes a ſhew to be carefull to performe his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, either by teaching them waies how to get themſelues reuenged, if they be of that ſort: or elſe by teaching them leſſons, how by moſt vile and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull meanes, they may obtaine gaine, and wordly commoditie, if they be of the other ſort.</p>

                     <p>There is the thing which I eſteeme their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be deluded in, and though they lie not in confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it, becauſe they thinke it to be trew, yet not to be ſo in ſubſtance or effect: for they ſay, that by diuers meanes they may conueene, either to the adoring of their Maſter, or to the putting in practiſe any ſeruice of his, committed vnto their charge: one way is naturall, which is naturall riding, going, or ſailing, at what houre their maſter comes and aduertiſes them: and this way may be eaſily belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; another way is ſome what more ſtrange, and yet it is poſſible to bee trew: which is, by being caried by the force of the ſpirit which is their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducter, either aboue the earth, or aboue the Sea ſwiftly, to the place where they are to meete: which I am perſwaded to bee likewiſe poſsible, in reſpect that as <hi>Habakkuk</hi> was carried by the Angel in that forme, to the den where <hi>Daniel</hi> lay; ſo thinke I, the diuell will be readie to imitate God,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:23110:79"/>as well in that as in other things:
<note place="margin">Apocrypha of Bel and the Dragon.</note> which is much more poſſible to him to doe, being a Spirit, then to a mighty wind, being but a naturall Meteore, to tranſport from one place to another, a ſolide body, as is commonly and daily ſeene in practiſe: But in this violent forme they cannot be caried, but a ſhort bounds, agreeing with the ſpace that they may retaine their breath: for if it were longer, their breath could not remaine vnextinguiſhed, their body being caried in ſuch a violent and forcible maner; as by example: If one fall off a ſmall height, his life is but in perill, according to the hard or ſoft lighting: but if one fall from an high and ſtay rocke, his breath will be forcibly baniſhed from the body, before he can win to the earth, as is oft ſeene by experience: And in this tranſporting they ſay themſelues, that they are inuiſible to any other, except amongſt themſelues, which may alſo be poſſible in my opinion: For if the deuill may forme what kinde of impreſſions he pleaſes in the aire, (as I haue ſaid before, ſpeaking of <hi>Magie</hi>) why may hee not farre eaſilier thicken and obſcure ſo the aire, that is next about them, by contracting it ſtraite together, that the beames of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans eyes cannot pierce thorow the ſame, to ſee them? But the third way of their comming to their conuentions, is that, wherein I thinke them deluded: for ſome of them ſay, that being transformed in the likeneſſe of a little beaſt or foule, they will come and pierce through whatſoeuer houſe or Church, though all ordinarie paſſages be cloſed, by whatſoeuer open the aire may enter in at: And ſome ſay, that their bodies lying ſtill, as in an extaſie, their ſpirits will be rauiſhed out of their bodies, and caried to ſuch places; and for verifying thereof, will giue euident tokens, as well by witneſſes that haue ſeene their body lying ſenceleſſe in the meane time, as by naming perſons whom-with they met, and giuing tokens what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was amongſt them, whom otherwiſe they could not haue knowen: for this forme of iourneying, they affirme to vſe moſt, when they are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from one countrey to another.</p>

                     <p>Surely I long to heare your owne opinion of this: for they are like old wiues trattles about the fire. The reaſons that mooue me to thinke that theſe are meere illuſions, are theſe: Firſt, for them that are transformed in likeneſſe of beaſts or foules, can enter through ſo narrow paſſages, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I may eaſily beleeue that the diuell could by his workmanſhip vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the aire, make them appeare to be in ſuch formes, either to themſelues, or to others: yet how he can contract a ſolide body within ſo little roome, I thinke it is directly contrary to it ſelfe; for to be made ſo little, and yet not diminiſhed; to be ſo ſtraitly drawen together, and yet feele no paine, I thinke it is ſo contrary to the qualitie of a naturall bodie, and ſo like to the little tranſubſtantiate god in the Papiſts Maſſe, that I can neuer beleeue it: So to haue a quantitie, is ſo proper to a ſolide body, that as all Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers conclude, it cannot be any more without one, then a ſpirit can haue one:
<note place="margin">Actes 12.</note> For when <hi>Peter</hi> came out of the priſon, and the doores all locked; it was not by any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracting of his body in ſo little roome, but by the giuing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:23110:79"/>place of the doore, though vneſpied by the Gaylors: And yet is there no compariſon, when this is done, betwixt the power of God, and of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel. As to their forme of extaſie and ſpirituall tranſporting, it is certaine the ſoules going out of the body, is the onely definition of naturall death: and who are once dead, God forbid we ſhould thinke that it ſhould lie in the power of all the diuels in hell, to reſtore them to their life againe; although he can put his owne ſpirit in a dead body, which the <hi>Necromancers</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly practiſe, as ye haue heard. For that is the office properly belonging to God; and beſides that, the ſoule once parting from the body, cannot wander any longer in the world, but to the owne reſting place muſt it goe immediately, abiding the coniunction of the body againe, at the latter day. And what Chriſt or the Prophets did miraculouſly in this caſe, it can in no Chriſtian mans opinion, be made common with the diuel. As for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tokens that they giue for prouing of this, it is very poſſible to the diuels craft, to perſwade them to theſe meanes: for he being a ſpirit, may he not ſo rauiſh their thoughts, and dull their ſenſes, that their body lying as dead, he may obiect to their ſpirits, as it were in a dreame, and (as the Poets write of <hi>Morpheus</hi>) repreſent ſuch formes of perſons, of places, and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as he pleaſes to illude them with? Yea, that he may deceiue them with the greater efficacie, may he not at that ſame inſtant by fellow angels of his, illude ſuch other perſons ſo in that ſame faſhion, whom-with hee makes them to beleeue that they mette, that all their reports and tokens, though ſeuerally examined, may euery one agree with another? And that whatſoeuer actions, either in hurting men or beaſts, or whatſoeuer other thing that they falſly imagine, at that time to haue done, may by himſelfe or his marrowes, at that ſame time be done indeed; ſo as if they would giue for a token of their being rauiſhed at the death of ſuch a perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſo ſhort ſpace thereafter, whom they beleeue to haue poiſoned, or witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that inſtant, might he not at that ſame houre, haue ſmitten that ſame perſon, by the permiſſion of GOD, to the farther deceiuing of them, and to mooue others to beleeue them? And this is ſurely the likelyeſt way, and moſt according to reaſon, which my iudgement can finde out in this, and whatſoeuer other vnnaturall points of their confeſſion: And by theſe meanes ſhall we ſaile ſurely, betwixt <hi>Charybdis</hi> and <hi>Scylla,</hi> in eſchewing the not beleeuing of them altogether on the one part, leſt that draw vs to the errour, that there is no <hi>Witches:</hi> and on the other part in beleeuing of it, make vs to eſchew the falling into innumerable abſurdities, both mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly againſt all Theologie diuine, and Philoſophie humane.</p>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:23110:80"/>workes a heauenly effect, though no wayes by any cooperation in them: And as Chriſt by clay and ſpettle wrought together,

And as to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of theſe two former parts; <hi>to wit,</hi> the conſultations and the outward meanes, they are ſo wonderfull, as I dare not alleadge any of them, without ioyning a ſufficient reaſon of the poſſibilitie thereof; For leauing all the ſmall trifles among wiues, and to ſpeake of the principall points of their craft, for the common trifles thereof, they can doe without conuerting well enough by themſelues, theſe principall points, I ſay, are theſe; They can make men or women to loue or hate other, which may be very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the diuel to effectuate, ſeeing he being a ſubtile ſpirit, knowes well enough how to perſwade the corrupted affection of them whom God wil permit him ſo to deale with: They can lay the ſickneſſe of one vpon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which likewiſe is very poſſible vnto him: For ſince by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, he laide ſickeneſſe vpon <hi>Iob,</hi> why may he not farre eaſilier lay it vpon any other; For as an old practitian, hee knowes well enough what humour domines moſt in any of vs, and as a ſpirit he can ſubtillie waken vp the ſame, making it peccant, or to abound, as hee thinkes meet for trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of vs, when God will ſo permit him: And for the taking off of it, no doubt he will be glad to relieue ſuch of preſent paine, as he may thinke by theſe meanes to perſwade to be catched in his euerlaſting ſnares and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. They can bewitch and take the life of men or women, by roaſting of the Pictures, as I ſpake of before, which likewiſe is verie poſſible to their maſter to performe: for although (as I ſaid before) that inſtrument of waxe haue no vertue in that turne doing, yet may he not very well, euen by the ſame meaſure, that his coniured ſlaues melts that waxe at the fire, may hee not, I ſay, at theſe ſame times, ſubtily, as a ſpirit, ſo weaken and ſcatter the ſpirits of life of the patient, as may make him on the one part, for faintneſſe, to ſweat out the humour of his bodie, and on the other part, for the not concurrence of theſe ſpirits, which cauſes his digeſtion, ſo debilitate his ſtomacke, that this humour radicall continually, ſweating out on the one part, and no new good ſucke being put in the place thereof, for lacke of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion on the other, he at laſt ſhall vaniſh away, euen as his picture will doe at the fire? And that knauiſh and cunning workeman, by troubling him, onely at ſometimes, makes a proportion, ſo neere betwixt the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the one and the other, that both ſhall end as it were at one time. They can raiſe ſtormes and tempeſts in the aire, either vpon Sea or land, though not vniuerſally, but in ſuch a particular place and preſcribed bounds, as GOD will permit them ſo to trouble: Which likewiſe is very eaſie to be diſcerned from any other naturall tempeſts that are Meteores, in reſpect of the ſudden and violent raiſing thereof, together with the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:23110:81"/>ſhort induring of the ſame. And this is likewiſe very poſſible to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to doe, hee hauing ſuch affinitie with the aire, as being a ſpirit, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſuch power of the forming and moouing thereof, as yee haue heard me alreadie declare:

And likewiſe they can make ſome to bee poſſeſſed with ſpirits, and ſo to become very Daemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacques: and this laſt ſort is very poſſible likewiſe to the diuel their maſter to doe, ſince he may eaſily ſend his owne angels to trouble in what forme he pleaſes, any whom God will permit him ſo to vſe.</p>

The firſt is, where ſpirits trouble ſome houſes or ſolitarie places: The ſecond, where Spirits follow vpon certaine perſons, and at diuers houres trouble them: The third, when they enter within them, and poſſeſſe them: The fourth is theſe kinde of Spirits that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vulgarly the <hi>Fairie:</hi> Of the three former kinds, ye heard already, how they may artificially be made by <hi>Witchcraft</hi> to trouble folke; now it reſtes to ſpeake of their naturall comming as it were, and not raiſed by <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft.</hi> But generally I muſt forewarne you of one thing before I enter in this purpoſe: that is, that although in my diſcourſing of them, I deuide them in diuers kinds, ye muſt notwithſtanding thereof note my phraſe of ſpeaking in that: For doubtleſlie they are in effect, but all one kinde of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who for abuſing the more of mankinde, take on theſe ſundrie ſhapes, and vſe diuers formes of outward actions, as if ſome were of nature better then other. Now I returne to my purpoſe: As to the firſt kinde of theſe ſpirits, that were called by the ancients by diuers names, according as their actions were: For if they were Spirits that haunted ſome houſes, by appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in diuers and horrible formes, and making great dinne, they were
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:23110:84"/>called <hi>Lemures</hi> or <hi>Spectra:</hi> If they appeared in likeneſſe of any defunct to ſome friends of his, they were called <hi>vmbraemortuorum:</hi> And ſo innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtiles they got, according to their actions, as I haue ſaid alreadie; as we ſee by experience, how many ſtiles they haue giuen them in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in the like maner. Of the appearing of theſe Spirits, we are certified by the Scriptures,
<note place="margin">Eſay 13. Iere. 50.</note> where the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> 13. and 34. Chap. threatning the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> declares, that it ſhall not onely be wracked, but ſhall become ſo great a ſolitude, as it ſhall be the habitacle of Howlets, and of <hi>Zijm</hi> and <hi>Ijm,</hi> which are the proper Hebrew names for theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. The cauſe why they haunt ſollitarie places, it is by reaſon, that they may affray and brangle the more the faith of ſuch as them alone hauntes ſuch places: For our nature is ſuch, as in companies we are not ſo ſoone moued to any ſuch kind of feare, as being ſollitarie, which the diuel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well enough, he will not therefore aſſaile vs but when wee are weake: And beſides that, God will not permit him ſo to diſhonour the ſocieties and companies of Chriſtians, as in publicque times and places to walke vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiblie amongſt them: On the other part, when he troubles certaine houſes that are dwelt in, it is a ſure token either of groſſe ignorance, or of ſome groſſe and ſlanderous ſinnes amongſt the inhabitants thereof, which God by that extraordinarie rod puniſhes.</p>

                     <p>But by what way or paſſage can theſe Spirits enter into theſe houſes, ſeeing they alledge that they will enter, doore and window be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſteiked?</p>

                     <p>They will chooſe the paſſage for their entreſſe, according to the forme that they are in at that time: For if they haue aſſumed a dead bodie, whereinto they lodge themſelues, they can eaſily enough open without dinne any doore or window, and enter in thereat; And if they enter as a Spirit onely, any place where the aire may come in at, is large enough an entrie for them: For as I ſaid before, a Spirit can occupie no quantitie.</p>

The reſt of them that the Scripture ſpeakes of, is not meaned by a locall remaining continually in one place, but by their reſting from their trauailes and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of this world, while their latter coniunction againe with the ſoule at that time, to receiue full glorie in both: And that the diuel may vſe as well the miniſtrie of the bodies of the faithfull in theſe caſes, as of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull, there is no inconuenience; for his haunting with their bodies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are dead, can no-waies defile them, in reſpect of the ſoules abſence: And for any diſhonour it can be vnto them, by what reaſon can it be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then the hanging, heading, or many ſuch ſhamefull deaths, that good

                     <p>That abhominable kinde of the diuels abuſing of men or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, was called of old, <hi>Incubi</hi> and <hi>Succubi,</hi> according to the difference of the ſexes that they conuerſed with. By two meanes this great kinde of abuſe might poſſibly be performed: The one, when the diuel onely as a Spirit, and ſtealing out the ſperme of a dead bodie, abuſes them that way, they not graithly ſeeing any ſhape, or feeling any thing, but that which hee ſo conueyes in that part, as we reade of a Monaſterie of Nunnes which were burnt for their being that way abuſed: The other meane is, when he borrowes a dead body and ſo viſibly, and as it ſeemes vnto them naturally as a man conuerſes with them. But it is to be noted, that in whatſoeuer way he vſeth it, that ſperme ſeemes intollerably cold to the perſon abuſed: For if he ſteale out the nature of a quicke perſon, it cannot be ſo quickly caried, but it will both tine the ſtrength and heate by the way, which it could neuer haue had for lacke of agitation, which in the time of procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the procurer and wakener vp of theſe two naturall qualities: And if he occupying the dead bodie as his lodging, expell the ſame out thereof in the due time, it muſt likewiſe be cold by the participation with the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the dead body whereout of it comes. And whereas ye enquire if theſe Spirits be diuided in ſexes or not, I thinke the rules of Philoſophie may eaſily reſolue a man of the contrary: For it is a ſure principle of that Art, that nothing can be diuided in ſexes, except ſuch liuing bodies as muſt haue a naturall ſeed to genere by: But we know Spirits haue no ſeed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to themſelues, nor yet can they gender one with an other.</p>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:23110:86"/>of a dead bodie, can worke nothing in generation, it is more nor plaine, as being alreadie dead of it ſelfe, as well as the reſt of the bodie is, wanting the naturall heate, and ſuch other naturall operation, as is neceſſarie for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that effect, and in caſe ſuch a thing were poſſible (which were vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly againſt all the rules of nature) it would breed no monſter, but onely ſuch a naturall off-ſpring, as would haue come betwixt that man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and that other abuſed perſon, in caſe they both being aliue had had a doe with other: For the Diuels part therein, is but the naked carrying or expelling of that ſubſtance; and ſo it could participate with no quality of the ſame.

The firſt is, whereby ſhall theſe poſſeſſed folkes be diſcerned fra them that are troubled with a naturall Phrenſie or <hi>Manie:</hi> The next is, how can it be that they can be remedied by the Papiſts Church, whom we counting as Heretiques, it ſhould appeare that one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell ſhould not caſt out another,

                     <p>As to your firſt queſtion; there are diuers ſymptomes, whereby that heauie trouble may be diſcerned from a naturall ſickeneſſe, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally three, omitting the diuers vaine ſignes that the Papiſts attribute vnto it: Such as the raging at holy water, their fleeing abacke from the Croſſe, their not abiding the hearing of God named, and innumerable ſuch like vaine things that were alike faſhious and feckles to recite: But to come to theſe three ſymptomes then, whereof I ſpake, I account the one of them to be the incredible ſtrength of the poſſeſſed creature, which will farre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede the ſtrength of ſixe of the wighteſt and wodeſt of any other men that are not ſo troubled: The next is the boldening vp ſo farre of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents breaſt and belly, with ſuch an vnnaturall ſturring and vehement agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation within them, and ſuch an ironie hardneſſe of his ſinewes ſo ſtiffely bended out, that it were not poſſible to pricke out as it were the skinne of any other perſon ſo farre; ſo mightily workes the diuell in all the members and ſenſes of his body, hee being locally within the ſame, ſuppoſe of his ſoule and affections thereof, hee haue no more power then of any other mans: The laſt is, the ſpeaking of ſundry languages, which the patient is knowen, by them that were acquainted with him, neuer to haue learned, and that with an vncouth and hollow voice, and all the time of his ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, a greater motion being in his breaſt then in his mouth: But fra this laſt ſymptome is excepted ſuch, as are altogether in the time of their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing bereft of all their ſenſes, being poſſeſſed with a dumbe and blind ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, whereof Chriſt relieued one, in the 12. of <hi>Matthew.</hi> And as to your next demand, it is firſt to be doubted if the Papiſts, or any not profeſſing the onely true Religion, can relieue any of that trouble: and next, in caſe they can, vpon what reſpect it is poſſible vnto them. As to the former, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two reaſons it is grounded: firſt that it is knowen ſo many of them to be counterfeit, which wyle the Clergie inuents for confirming of their
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:23110:87"/>rotten Religion: The next is, that by experience we finde, that few who are poſſeſſed indeed, are fully cured by them; but rather the diuell is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to releaſe the bodily hurting of them, for a ſhort ſpace, thereby to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the perpetuall hurt of the ſoules of ſo many that by theſe falſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles may be induced or confirmed in the profeſſion of that erroneous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; euen as I told you before that he doeth in the falſe cures or caſting off of diſeaſes by Witches. As to the other part of the argument in caſe they can, which rather (with reuerence of the learned thinking otherwiſe) I am induced to beleeue, by reaſon of the faithfull report that men ſound of Religion, haue made according to their ſight thereof, I thinke if ſo be I ſay theſe may be the reſpects, whereupon the Papiſts may haue that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Chriſt gaue a commiſſion and power to his Apoſtles to caſt out diuels, which they according thereunto put in execution: the rules he bade them obſerue in that action, was faſting and prayer; and the action it ſelfe to be done in his name. This power of theirs proceeded not then of any vertue in them, but onely in him who directed them; as was clearely prooued by <hi>Iudas</hi> his hauing as great power in that commiſſion, as any of the reſt. It is eaſie then to be vnderſtood that the caſting out of diuels, is by the vertue of faſting and prayer, and in calling of the Name of God, ſuppoſe many imperfections be in the perſon that is the inſtrument, as Chriſt himſelfe teacheth vs of the power that falſe prophets ſhall haue to caſt out diuels. It is no wonder then, theſe reſpects of this action being conſidered, that it may be poſſible to the Papiſts, though erring in ſundry points of Religion to accompliſh this, if they vſe the right forme preſcribed by Chriſt herein: For what the worſe is that action that they erre in other things; more then their Baptiſme is the worſe that they erre in the other Sacrament, and haue eiked many vaine freittes to the Baptiſme it ſelfe.</p>

To ſpeake of the many vaine trattles founded vpon that illuſion, How there was a King and Queene of <hi>Phairie,</hi> of ſuch a iolly court and traine as they had, how they had a teynd, and duetie, as it were, of all goods, how they naturally rode and went, eate and dranke, and did all other actions like naturall men and women, I thinke it liker <hi>Virgils Campi Elyſij,</hi> nor any thing that ought to be beleeued by Chriſtians, except in generall, that as I ſpake ſundrie times before, the diuell illuded the ſenſes of ſundrie ſimple creatures, in making them beleeue that they ſaw and heard ſuch things as were nothing ſo indeed.</p>

                     <p>I thinke they are not a haire the leſſe guiltie: For the Diuel durſt neuer haue borrowed their ſhadow or ſimilitude to that turne, if their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent had not beene at it: And the conſent in theſe turnes is death of the lawe.</p>

                        <hi>Samuel</hi> was dead as well before that; and ſo none could ſlaunder him with medling in that vnlawful arte. For the cauſe why, as I take it, that God will not permit Satan to vſe the ſhapes of ſimilitudes of any innocent perſons at ſuch vnlawfull times, is, that God will not permit that any inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſons ſhalbe ſlandered with that vile defection: for then the diuell would finde waies anew, to calumniate the beſt. And this wee haue in proofe by them that are carried with the <hi>Phairie,</hi> who neuer ſee the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of any in that Court, but of them that thereafter are tryed to haue beene brethren and ſiſters of that craft: And this was likewiſe prooued by the confeſſion of a young Laſſe, troubled with ſpirits, laid on her by Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft: that although ſhe ſaw the ſhapes of diuers men and women trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling her, and naming the perſons whom theſe ſhadowes repreſent: yet neuer one of them are found to be innocent, but all clearely tryed to bee moſt guiltie, and the moſt part of them confeſſing the ſame. And beſides that, I thinke it hath beene ſeldome heard tell of, that any, whom perſons guiltie of that crime accuſed, as hauing knowen them to be their marrowes by eye-ſight, and not by heare-ſay, but ſuch as were ſo accuſed of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, could not be clearely tried vpon them, were at the leaſt publikely knowen to be of a very euill life and reputation: ſo iealous is God I ſay, of the fame of them that are innocent in ſuch cauſes. And beſides that, there are two other good helps that may be vſed for their triall: The one is, the finding of their marke, and the trying the inſenſiblenes therof: The other
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:23110:90"/>is their fleeting on the water: for as in a ſecret murther, if the dead carkaſſe bee at any time thereafter handled by the murtherer, it will guſh out of bloud, as if the bloud were crying to the heauen for reuenge of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, God hauing appointed that ſecret ſupernaturall ſigne, for triall of that ſecret vnnaturall crime, ſo it appeares that God hath appointed (for a ſupernaturall ſigne of the monſtrous impietie of Witches) that the water ſhall refuſe to receiue them in her boſome, that haue ſhaken off them the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred water of Baptiſme, and wilfully refuſed the benefite thereof: No, not ſo much as their eyes are able to ſhed teares (threaten and torture them as ye pleaſe) while firſt they repent (God not permitting them to diſſemble their obſtinacie in ſo horrible a crime) albeit the women-kind eſpecially, be able otherwayes to ſhed teares at euery light occaſion when they will, yea, although it were diſſemblingly like the Crocodiles.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Haritable Reader, it is one of the golden Sentences, which Chriſt our Sauiour vttered to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, that there <hi>is nothing ſo couered,
<note place="margin">Luk. 12.</note> that ſhal not be reuealed, neither ſo hidde, that ſhall not be knowen: and whatſoeuer they haue ſpoken in darkeneſſe, ſhould be heard in the light: and that which they had ſpoken in the eare in ſecret place, ſhould be publikely preached on the tops of the houſes:</hi> And ſince he hath ſaid it, most trew muſt it be, fince the authour thereof is the fountaine and very being of trewth: which ſhould mooue all godly and honest men, to be very warie in all their ſecreteſt actions, and whatſoeuer middeſſes they vſe for attaining to their moſt wiſhed ends; leſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how auowable ſoeuer the marke be, whereat they aime, the middeſſes being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to be ſhamefull whereby they climbe, it may turne to the diſgrace both of the good worke it ſelfe, and of the authour thereof; ſince the deepeſt of our ſecrets, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hidde from that all-ſeeing eye and penetrant light, piercing through the bowels of very darkeneſse it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>But as this is generally trew in the actions of all men, ſo is it more ſpecially trew in the affaires of Kings: for Kings being publike perſons, by reaſon of their office and authority, are as it were ſet (as it was ſaid of old) vpon a publike ſtage, in the ſight of all the people; where all the beholders eyes are attentiuely bent to looke and pry in the least circumſtance of their ſecretest drifts: Which ſhould make Kings the more carefull not to harbour the ſecreteſt thought in their minde, but ſuch as in the owne time they ſhall not be aſhamed openly to auouch; aſſuring themſelues that Time the mother of Veritie, will in the due ſeaſon bring her owne daughter to perfection.</p>
               <p>The trew practiſe hereof, I haue as a King oft found in my owne perſon, though I thanke God, neuer to my ſhame, hauing laide my count, euer to walke as in the eyes of the Almightie, examining euer ſo the ſecretest of my drifts, before I gaue them courſe, as how they might ſome day bide the touchstone of a publike triall. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst thereſt of my ſecret actions, which haue (vnlooked for of me) come to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like knowledge, it hath ſo fared with my <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, directed to my eldeſt ſon; which I wrote for exerciſe of mine owne ingyne, and instruction of him, who is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God (I hope) to ſit on my Throne after me: For the purpoſe and matter thereof being onely fit for a King, as teaching him his office; and the perſon whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for it was ordained, a Kings heire, whoſe ſecret counſellor and faithfull admoniſher it must be, I thought it no wayes conuenient nor comely, that either it ſhould to all be
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:23110:93"/>proclaimed, which to one onely appertained (and specially being a meſſenger betwixt two ſo coniunct perſons) or yet that the mould whereupon he ſhould frame his future behauiour, when hee comes both vnto the perfection of his yeeres, and poſseſsion of his inheritance, ſhould before the hand be made common to the people, the ſubiect of his future happy gouernment. And therefore for the more ſecret and cloſe keeping of them, I onely permitted ſeuen of them to be printed, the Printer being firſt ſworne for ſecrecie: and theſe ſeuen I disperſed amongst ſome of my trustieſt ſeruants, to be keeped cloſely by them, leſt in caſe by the iniquitie or wearing of time, any of them might haue beene loſt, yet ſome of them might haue remained after me, as witneſses to my Sonne, both of the honeſt integritie of my heart, and of my fatherly affection and naturall care towards him. But ſince contrary to my intention and expectation, as I haue alreadie ſaid, this Booke is now vented, and ſet foorth to the publike view of the world, and conſequently ſubiect to euery mans cenſure, as the current of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection leades him, I am now forced, as well for reſisting to the malice of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of enuie, who like waſpes ſucke venome out of euery wholſome herbe; as for the ſatisfaction of the godly honeſt ſort, in any thing that they may mistake therein, both to publiſh and ſpread the true copies thereof, for defacing of the falſe copies that are alreadie ſpread, as I am enformed; as likewiſe by this Preface, to cleare ſuch parts thereof, as in reſpect of the conciſed ſhortneſse of my Style, may be miſ-interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein.</p>
               <p>To come then particularly to the matter of my Booke, there are two ſpeciall great points, which (as I am informed) the malicious ſort of men haue detracted therein; and ſome of the honest ſort haue ſeemed a little to mistake: whereof the first and greatest is, that ſome ſentences therein ſhould ſeeme to furniſh grounds to men, to doubt of my ſinceritie in that Religion, which I haue euer constantly profeſſed: the other is, that in ſome parts thereof I ſhould ſeeme to nouriſh in my minde, a vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue reſolution againſt <hi>England,</hi> or at the leaſt, ſome principals there, for the Queene my mothers quarrell.</p>
               <p>The first calumnie (moſt grieuous indeed) is grounded vpon the ſharpe and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wordes, that therein are vſed in the deſcription of the humors of Puritanes, and raſh-headie Preachers, that thinke it their honour to contend with Kings, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe whole kingdomes. The other point is onely grounded vpon the ſtrait charge. I giue my Sonne, not to heare nor ſuffer any vnreuerent ſpeeches or bookes against any of his parents or progenitors: wherein I doe alledge my owne experience anent the Queene my mother; affirming, that I neuer found any that were of perfit aage the time of her reigne here, ſo ſtedfaſtly trew to me in all my troubles, as theſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept their allegiance to her in her time. But if the charitable Reader will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedly conſider, both the methode and matter of my Treatiſe, he will eaſily iudge, what wrong I haue ſuſtained by the carping at both: For my Booke, ſuppoſe very ſmall, being diuided in three ſeuerall parts; the first part thereof onely treats of a Kings duety towards God in Religion, wherein I haue ſo clearely made profeſsion of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, calling it the Religion wherein I was brought vp, and euer made profeſsion of, and wiſhing him euer to continue in the ſame, as the onely trew forme of Gods worſhip; that I would haue thought my ſincere plainneſſe in that firſt part vpon that ſubiect, ſhould haue ditted the mouth of the moſt enuious <hi>Momus,</hi> that euer
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:23110:93"/>hell did hatch, from barking at any other part of my booke vpon that ground, except they would alledge me to be contrarie to my ſelfe, which in ſo ſmall a volume would ſmell of too great weakeneſſe, and ſliprineſſe of memory. And the ſecond part of my booke, teaches my Sonne how to vſe his Office, in the adminiſtration of Iuſtice and Politicke Gouernment: The third onely containing a Kings outward behauiour in indifferent things; what agreeance and conformitie hee ought to keepe betwixt his outward behauiour in theſe things, and the vertuous qualities of his minde; and how they ſhould ſerue for trunſh-men, to interprete the inward dispoſition of the minde, to the eyes of them that cannot ſee farther within him, and therefore muſt onely iudge of him by the outward appearance: So as if there were no more to be looked into, but the very methode and order of the booke, it will ſufficiently cleare me of that firſt and grieuouſeſt imputation, in the point of Religion: ſince in the firſt part, where Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is onely treated of, I ſpeake ſo plainely. And what in other parts I ſpeake of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanes, it is onely of their morall faults, in that part where I ſpeake of Policie: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring when they contemne the Law and ſouereigne authoritie, what exemplare pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment they deſerue for the ſame. And now as to the matter it ſelfe whereupon this ſcandall is taken, that I may ſufficiently ſatisfie all honest men, and by a iuſt Apologie raiſe vp a braſen wall or bulwarke againſt all the darts of the enuious, I will the more narrowly rip vp the words, whereat they ſeeme to be ſomewhat ſtomacked.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, as to the name of Puritanes, I am not ignorant that the style thereof doeth properly belong onely to that vile ſect amongst the Anabaptiſts, called the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of loue; becauſe they thinke themſelues onely pure, and in a maner without ſinne, the onely trwe Church, and onely worthy to be participant of the Sacraments, and all the reſt of the world to be but abomination in the ſight of God. Of this ſpeciall ſect I principally meane, when I ſpeake of Puritans; diuers of them, as <hi>Browne, Penry</hi> and others, hauing at ſundrie times come into Scotland, to ſow their popple amongst vs (and from my heart I wiſh, that they had left no ſchollers behinde them, who by their fruits will in the owne time be manifested) and partly indeede, I giue this ſtyle to ſuch brain-ſicke and headie Preachers their diſciples and followers, as refuſing to be called of that ſect, yet participate too much with their humours, in maintaining the aboue mentioned errours; not onely agreeing with the generall rule of all Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, in the contempt of the ciuill Magiſtrate, and in leaning to their owne dreams and reuelations; but particularly with this ſect, in accounting all men profane that ſweare not to all their fantaſies, in making for euery particular queſtion of the policie of the Church, as great commotion, as if the article of the Trinitie were called in controuerſie, in making the ſcriptures to be ruled by their conſcience, and not their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience by the Scripture; and he that denies the leaſt iote of their grounds, <hi>ſit tibi tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ethnicus &amp; publicanus;</hi> not worthy to enioy the benefite of breathing, much leſſe to participate with them of the Sacraments: and before that any of their grounds be impugned, let King, people, Law and all be trode vnder foote: Such holy warres are to be preferred to an vngodly peace: no, in ſuch caſes Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not onely to be reſiſted vnto, but not to be prayed for, for prayer must come of Faith; and it is reuealed to their conſciences, that GOD will heare no prayer for ſuch a Prince. Iudge then, Chriſtian Reader, if I wrong this ſort of people, in giuing them the ſtile of that ſect, whoſe errours they imitate: and ſince they are contented
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:23110:94"/>to weare their liuerie let them not be aſhamed to borrow alſo their name. It is onely of this kinde of men, that in this booke I write ſo ſharply; and whom I wiſh my Sonne to puniſh, in-caſe they refuſe to obey the Law, and will not ceaſe to ſturre vp a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: Whom against I haue written the more bitterly, in respect of diuers famous libels, and iniurious ſpeaches ſpred by ſome of them, not onely diſhonourably inuectiue against all Christian Princes, but euen reprochfull to our profeſsion and Religion, in respect they are come out vnder coulour thereof: and yet were neuer anſwered but by Papists, who generally medle aſwell against them, as the religion it ſelfe; whereby the skandale was rather doubled, then taken away. But on the other part, I protest vpon mine honour, I meane it not generally of all Preachers, or others, that like bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſingle forme of policie in our Church, then of the many Ceremonies in the Church of England: that are perſwaded, that their Biſhops ſmell of a Papall ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, that the Surpliſe, the cornerd cap, and ſuch like, are the outward badges of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh errours. No, I am ſo farre from being contentious in theſe things (which for my owne part I euer esteemed as indifferent) as I doe equally loue and honour the learned and graue men of either of theſe opinions. It can no wayes become me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſo lightly a ſentence, in ſo old a controuerſie. Wee all (God be praiſed) doe agree in the grounds; and the bitterneſse of men vpon ſuch questions, doeth but trouble the peace of the Church; and giues aduantage and entry to the Papists by our diuiſion: But towards them, I onely vſe this prouiſion, that where the Law is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, they may content themſelues ſoberly and quietly with their owne opinions, not reſisting to the authoritie, nor breaking the Law of the Countrey; neither aboue all, ſturring any rebellion or ſchiſme: but poſſeſsing their ſoules in peace, let them preaſſe by patience, and well grounded reaſons, either to perſwade all the rest to like of their iudgements; or where they ſee better grounds on the other part, not to bee aſhamed peaceably to incline thereunto, laying aſide all praeoccupied opinions.</p>
               <p>And that this is the onely meaning of my Booke, and not any coldneſſe or cracke in Religion, that place doeth plainely witneſſe, where, after I haue ſpoken of the faults in our Eccleſiasticall eſtate I exhort my ſonne to be beneficiall vnto the good-men of the Miniſtrie; praiſing God there, that there is preſently a ſufficient number of good men of them in this kingdome: and yet are they all knowne to be againſt the forme of the Engliſh Church. Yea, ſo farre I am in that place from admitting corruption in Religion, as I wiſh him in promoouing them, to vſe ſuch caution, as may preſerue their eſtate from creeping to corruption; euer vſing that forme through the whole Booke, where euer I ſpeake of bad Preachers, terming them ſome of the Miniſters, and not Miniſters or Miniſtrie in generall. And to conclude this point of Religion, what indifferencie of Religion can <hi>Momus</hi> call that in mee, where, ſpeaking of my ſonnes marriage (in caſe it pleaſed God before that time to cut the threed of my life) I plainly forewarne him of the inconuenients that were like to enſew, incaſe he ſhould marry any that be of a different profeſsion in Religion from him: notwithstanding that the number of Princes profeſsing our Religion be ſo ſmall, as it is hard to foreſee, how he can be that way, meetly matched according to his ranke.</p>
               <p>And as for the other point, that by ſome parts in this booke, it ſhould appeare, that I doe nouriſh in my minde, a vindictiue reſolution againſt England, or ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals there; it is ſurely more then wonderfull vnto me, vpon what grounds they can
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:23110:94"/>haue gathered ſuch concluſions. For as vpon the one part, Ineither by name nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription poynt out England in that part of my diſcourſe; ſo vpon the other, I plainly bewray my meaning to be of Scottiſh-men, where I conclude that purpoſe in theſe termes: <q>That the loue I beare to my Sonne, hath mooued me to be ſo plaine in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: for ſo that I diſcharge my conſcience to him in vttering the verity, I care not what any traitour or treaſon-allower doe thinke of it.</q> And Engliſh-men could not thereby be meant, ſince they could be no traitours, where they ought no alleageance. I am not ignorant of a wiſe and princely apophthegme, which the ſame Queene of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland vttered about the time of her owne Coronation. But the drift of that diſcourſe doth fully cleare my intention, being onely grounded vpon that precept to my Sonne, that he ſhould not permit any vnreuerent detracting of his praedeceſſours; bringing in that purpoſe of my mother onely for an example of my experience anent Scottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, without vſing any perſwaſion to him of reuenge. For a Kings giuing of any fault the dew ſtile, inferres no reduction of the faulters pardon. No, I am by a degree nearer of kinne vnto my mother then he is, neither thinke I my ſelfe, either that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie, or that neere my end, that I neede to make ſuch a <hi>Dauidicall</hi> teſtament; ſince I haue euer thought it the dewtie of a worthie Prince, rather with a pike, then a penne, to write his iuſt reuenge: But in this matter I haue no delite to be large, wiſhing all men to iudge of my future proiects, according to my by-paſt actions.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing as much inſiſted in the clearing of theſe two points, as will (I hope) giue ſufficient ſatisfaction to all honeſt men, and leauing the enuious to the foode of their owne venome; I will heartily pray thee, louing Reader, charitably to conceiue of my honeſt intention in this Booke. I know the greatest part of the people of this whole Iſle, haue beene very curious for a ſight thereof: ſome for the loue they beare me, either being particularly acquainted with me, or by a good report that perhappes they haue heard of me; and therefore longed to ſee any thing, that proceeded from that authour whom they ſo loued and honoured; ſince bookes are viue Idees of the authours minde. Some onely for meere curioſitie, that thinke it their honour to know all new things, were curious to glut their eyes therewith, onely that they might vaunt them to haue ſeene it: and ſome fraughted with cauſleſſe enuie at the Authour, did gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſearch out the booke, thinking their ſtomacke jit ynough, for turning neuer ſo wholeſome foode into noyſome and infectiue bumours: So as this their great concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in curiofitie (though proceeding from farre different complexions) hath enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the vn-timous divulgating of this Booke, farre contrarie to my intention, as I haue alreadie ſaid. To which <hi>Hydra</hi> of diuerſly-enclined ſpectatours, I haue no targe to oppone but plaineneſſe, patience, and ſinceritie: plaineneſſe, for reſoluing and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the first ſort; patience, for to beare with the ſhallowneſſe of the next; and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie, to defie the malice of the third with-all. Though I cannot pleaſe all men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I am contented, ſo that Ionely pleaſe the vertuous ſort: and though they alſo finde not euery thing therein, ſo fully to anſwere their expectation, as the argument would ſeeme to require; although I would wiſh them modeſtly to remember, that God hes not beſtowed all his gifts vpon one, but parted them by a iuſtice distributiue; and that many eyes ſee more then one; and that the varietie of mens mindes is ſuch, that <hi>tot capita totſenſus;</hi> yea, and that euen the very faces, that God hath by nature brought foorth in the world, doe euery one in ſome of their particular lineaments, differ from
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:23110:95"/>any other: yet in trewth it was not my intention in handling of this purpoſe (as it is eaſie to perceiue) fully to ſet downe heere all ſuch grounds, as might out of the beſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue beene alledged, and out of my owne inuention and experience added, for the perfite inſtitution of a King: but onely to giue ſome ſuch precepts to my owne Sonne, for the gouernement of this kingdome, as was meetest for him to be instructed in, and beſt became me to be the informer of.</p>
               <p>If I in this Booke haue beene too particularly plaine, impute it to the neceſsitie of the ſubiect, not ſo much being ordained for the inſtitution of a Prince in generall, as I haue ſaid, as containing particular precepts to my Sonne in ſpeciall: whereof he could haue made but a generall vſe, if they had not contained the particular diſeaſes of this kingdome, with the beſt remedies for the ſame, which it became me best as a King, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing learned both the theoricke and practicke thereof, more plainely to expreſſe, then any ſimple ſchoole man, that onely knowes matters of kingdomes by contemplation.</p>
               <p>But if in ſome places it ſeeme too obſcure, impute it to the ſhortneſſe thereof, being both for the reſpect of my ſelfe, and of my Sonne, conſtrained there-unto: my owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, for fault of leaſure, being ſo continually occupied in the affaires of my office, as my great burthen, and reſtleſſe faſhery is more then knowen, to all that knowes or beares of me: for my Sonnes reſpect, becauſe I know by my ſelf, that a Prince ſo long as he is young, wil be ſo caried away with ſome ſort of delight or other, that he cannot pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently abide the reading of any large volume: and when he comes to a ful maturity of aage, he muſt be ſo buſied in the actiue part of his charge, as he will not be permitted to beſtow many houres vpon the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templatiue part therof: So as it was neither fit for him, nor poſsible for me, to haue made this Treatiſe any more ample then it is. Indeed I am li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beholden to the curioſitie of ſome, who thinking it too large alreadie (as appears) for lacke of leiſure to copy it, drew ſome notes out of it, for ſpeeds ſake; putting in the one halfe of the purpoſe, and leauing out the other: not vnlike the man that alledged that part of the Pſalme, <hi>non eſt Deus,</hi> but left out the praeceeding words, <hi>Dixit inſipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens in corde ſuo.</hi> And of theſe notes, making a little pamphlet (lacking both my methode and halfe of my matter) entituled it, forſooth, <hi>the Kings Teſtament,</hi> as if I had eiked a third Teſtament of my owne to the two that are in the holy Scriptures. It is trew that in a place thereof, for affirmation of the purpoſe I am ſpeaking of to my Sonne, I bring my ſelfe in there, as ſpeaking vpon my Teſtament: for in that ſenſe, euery record in write of a mans opinion in anything (in respect that papers out-liue their authours) is as it were a Teſtament of that mans will in that caſe: and in that ſenſe it is, that in that place I call this Treatiſe a Testament. But from any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſentence in a booke, to giue the booke it ſelfe a title, is as ridiculous, as to ſtyle the booke of the Pſalmes, the booke of <hi>Dixit inſipiens,</hi> becauſe with theſe wordes one of them doeth begin.</p>
               <p>Well, leauing theſe new baptizers and blockers of other mens books, to their owne follies, Ireturne to my purpoſe, anent the ſhortneſſe of this booke, ſuſpecting that all my excuſes for the ſhortneſse thereof, ſhall not ſatisfie ſome, eſpecially in our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour countrey: who thought, that as I haue ſo narrowly in this Treatiſe touched all the principall ſickneſses in our kingdome, with ouertures for the remedies thereof, as I ſaid before: ſo looked they to haue found ſomething therein, that ſhould haue touched the ſickneſses of their ſtate, in the like ſort. But they will eaſily excuſe me thereof, if they
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:23110:95"/>will conſider the forme I haue vſed in this Treatiſe; wherein I onely teach my Son, out of my owne experience, what forme of gouernment is fittest for this kingdome: and in one part thereof ſpeaking of the borders, I plainely there doe excuſe my ſelfe, that I will ſpeake nothing of the ſtate of <hi>England,</hi> as a matter wherein I neuer had experience. I know indeed, no kingdome lackes her owne diſeaſes, and likewiſe what interest I haue in the proſperitie of that ſtate: for although I would be ſilent, my blood and diſcent doeth ſufficiently proclaime it. But notwithſtanding, ſince there is a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Queene there preſently reigning, who hath ſo long with ſo great wiſedome and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie gouerned her kingdomes, as (I muſt in trew ſinceritie confeſſe) the like hath not beene read nor heard of, either in our time, or ſince the dayes of the Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> it could no wayes become me, farre inferiour to her in knowledge and experience, to be a buſie-body in other princes matters, and to fiſh in other folkes waters, as the prouerbe is: No, I hope by the contrary (with Gods grace) euer to keepe that Christian rule, To doe as I would be done to: and I doubt nothing, yea euen in her name I dare promiſe, by the bypast experience of her happy gouernment, as I haue already ſaid, that no good ſubiect ſhall be more carefull to enforme her of any corruptions ſtollen in in her ſtate, then ſhee ſhall be zealous for the diſcharge of her conſcience and honour, to ſee the ſame purged, and restored to the ancient integritie; and further during her time, becomes me least of any to meddle in.</p>
               <p>And thus hauing reſolued all the doubts, ſo farre as I can imagine, may be moued against this Treatiſe; it onely reſts to pray thee (charitable Reader) to interprete fauourably this birth of mine, according to the integritie of the author, and not looking for perfection in the worke it ſelfe. As for my part, I onely glory thereof in this point, that I trust no ſort of vertue is condemned, nor any degree of vice allowed in it: and that (though it be not perhaps ſo gorgeouſly decked, and richly attired as it ought to be) it is at the least rightly proportioned in all the members, without any menstrous deformitie in any of them: and ſpecially that ſince it was firſt written in ſecret, and is now publiſhed, not of ambition, but of a kinde of neceſsitie; it must be taken of all men, for the trew image of my very minde, and forme of the rule, which I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to my ſelfe and mine; Which as in all my actions I haue bitherto preaſſed to expreſſe, ſo farre as the nature of my charge, and the condition of time would permit me: ſo beareth it a diſcouery of that which may be looked for at my hand, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euen in my ſecret thoughts, I haue engaged my ſelfe for the time to come. And thus in a firme truſt, that it ſhall pleaſe God, who with my being and Crowne, gaue me this minde, to maintaine and augment the ſame in me and my poſteritie, to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our conſcience, the maintenance of our Honour, and weale of our people, I bid thee heartily farewell.</p>

<note place="margin">Double bond of a Prince to God.</note> firſt, for that he made you a man; and next, for that he made you a little GOD to ſit on his Throne, and rule ouer other men. Remember, that as in dignitie hee hath erected you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue others, ſo ought ye in thankfulneſſe towards him, goe as farre beyond all others. A moate in anothers eye, is a beame into yours: a blemiſh in another, is a leprouſe byle into you: and a veniall ſinne (as the Papiſts call it) in another, is a great crime into you. Thinke not therefore, that the highneſſe of your dignitie,
<note place="margin">The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fault of a Prince.</note> dimmiſheth your faults (much leſſe giueth you a licence to ſinne) but by the contrary your fault ſhall be aggrauated, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the height of your dignitie; any ſinne that ye commit, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſingle ſinne procuring but the fall of one; but being an exemplare
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:23110:96"/>ſinne, and therefore drawing with it the whole multitude to be guiltie of the ſame. Remember then, that this gliſtering worldly glorie of Kings,
<note place="margin">The trew glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Kings.</note> is giuen them by God, to teach them to preaſſe ſo to gliſter and ſhine before their people, in all workes of ſanctification and righteouſneſſe, that their perſons as bright lampes of godlineſſe and vertue, may, going in and out before their people, giue light to all their ſteps. Remember alſo, that by the right knowledge, and feare of God (which is <hi>the beginning of Wiſedome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou 9.10.</note> as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) ye ſhall know all the things neceſſarie for the diſcharge of your duetie, both as a Chriſtian, and as a King; ſeeing in him, as in a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, the courſe of all earthly things, whereof hee is the ſpring and onely moouer.</p>
               <p>Now, the onely way to bring you to this knowledge,
<note place="margin">The meanes to know God.</note> is diligently to reade his word, and earneſtly to pray for the right vnderſtanding thereof. <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> ſayth Chriſt, <hi>for they beare teſtimonie of me:</hi> and,
<note place="margin">Iohn 5.39.</note> 
                  <hi>the whole Scripture,</hi> ſaith Paul, <hi>is giuen by inſpiration of God, and is profitable to teach,
<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16.17.</note> to conuince, to correct, and to instruct in righteouſneſse; that the man of God may be abſolute, being made perfite vnto all good workes.</hi> And moſt properly of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, belongeth the reading thereof vnto Kings,
<note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> ſince in that part of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where the godly Kings are firſt made mention of, that were ordained to rule ouer the people of God, there is an expreſſe and moſt notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation and commandement giuen them, to reade and meditate in the Law of God. I ioyne to this, the carefull hearing of the doctrine with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and reuerence: for, <hi>faith commeth by hearing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10.17.</note> ſayth the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. But aboue all, beware ye wreſt not the word to your owne appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, as ouer many doe, making it like a bell to ſound as ye pleaſe to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete: but by the contrary, frame all your affections, to follow preciſely the rule there ſet downe.</p>
               <p>The whole Scripture chiefly containeth two things: a command,
<note place="margin">Wherein chiefely the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth.</note> and a prohibition, to doe ſuch things, and to abſtaine from the contrary. Obey in both; neither thinke it enough to abſtaine from euill, and do no good; nor thinke not that if yee doe many good things, it may ſerue you for a cloake to mixe euill turnes therewith. And as in theſe two points, the whole Scripture principally conſiſteth,
<note place="margin">Two degrees of the ſeruice of God.</note> ſo in two degrees ſtandeth the whole ſeruice of God by man: interiour, or vpward; exteriour, or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: the firſt, by prayer in faith towards God; the next, by workes flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefra before the world: which is nothing elſe, but the exerciſe of Religion towards God, and of equitie towards your neighbour.</p>
               <p>As for the particular points of Religion, I need not to dilate them; I am no hypocrite, follow my footſteps,
<note place="margin">A regardable paterne.</note> and your owne preſent education therein. I thanke God, I was neuer aſhamed to giue account of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, howſoeuer the malicious lying tongues of ſome haue traduced me: and if my conſcience had not reſolued me, that all my Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently profeſſed by me and my kingdome, was grounded vpon the plaine wordes of the Scripture, without the which all points of Religion are
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:23110:97"/>ſuperfluous, as any thing contrary to the ſame is abomination, I had neuer outwardly auowed it, for pleaſure or awe of any fleſh.</p>
               <p>And as for the points of equitie towards your neigbour (becauſe that will fall in properly, vpon the ſecond part concerning a Kings office) I leaue it to the owne roume.</p>
               <p>For the firſt part then of mans ſeruice to his God,
<note place="margin">Religion.</note> which is Religion, that is, the worſhip of God according to his reuealed will, it is wholly grounded vpon the Scripture, as I haue alreadie ſaid, quickened by faith, and conſerued by conſcience: For the Scripture, I haue now ſpoken of it in generall, but that yee may the more readily make choice of any part thereof, for your inſtruction or comfort, remember ſhortly this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode.</p>
               <p>The whole Scripture is dyted by Gods Spirit,
<note place="margin">The methode of Scripture.</note> thereby, as by his liuely word, to inſtruct and rule the whole Church militant to the end of the word: It is compoſed of two parts, the Olde and New Teſtament: The ground of the former is the Lawe, which ſheweth our ſinne, and contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth iuſtice: the ground of the other is Chriſt, who pardoning ſinne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth grace. The ſumme of the Law is the tenne Commandements, more largely delated in the bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Of the Law.</note> interpreted and applied by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and by the hiſtories, are the examples ſhewed of obedience or diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience thereto, and what <hi>praemium</hi> or <hi>poena</hi> was accordingly giuen by God: But becauſe no man was able to keepe the Law, nor any part thereof, it pleaſed God of his infinite wiſedome and goodneſſe, to incarnate his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sonne in our nature, for ſatisfaction of his iuſtice in his ſuffering for vs; that ſince we could not be ſaued by doing, we might at leaſt, bee ſaued by beleeuing.</p>
               <p>The ground therefore of the word of grace,
<note place="margin">Of Grace.</note> is contained in the foure hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of the birth, life, death, reſurrection and aſcention of Chriſt: The larger interpretation and vſe thereof, is contained in the Epiſtles of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: and the practiſe in the faithfull or vnfaithfull, with the hiſtorie of the infancie and firſt progreſſe of the Church is contained in their Actes.</p>
               <p>Would ye then know your ſinne by the Lawe?
<note place="margin">Vſe of the Law.</note> reade the bookes of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> containing it. Would ye haue a commentarie thereupon? Reade the Prophets, and likewiſe the bookes of the <hi>Prouerbes</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiastes,</hi> written by that great patterne of wiſedome <hi>Salomon;</hi> which will not only ſerue you for inſtruction, how to walke in the obedience of the Lawe of God, but is alſo ſo full of golden ſentences, and morall precepts, in all things that can concerne your conuerſation in the world, as among all the prophane Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers and Poets, ye ſhall not finde ſo rich a ſtorehouſe of precepts of naturall wiſedome, agreeing with the will and diuine wiſedome of God. Would ye ſee how good men are rewarded, and wicked puniſhed? looke the hiſtoricall parts of theſe ſame bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> together with the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> the <hi>Iudges, Ezra, Nehemiah, Eſther,</hi> and <hi>Iob:</hi> but eſpecially the bookes of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles,</hi> wherewith ye ought to bee familiarly
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:23110:97"/>acquainted: for there ſhall yee ſee your ſelfe, as in a myrrour, in the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue either of the good or the euill Kings.</p>
               <p>Would yee know the doctrine, life, and death of our Sauiour Chriſt?
<note place="margin">Vſe of the Goſpel.</note> reade the Euangeliſts. Would ye bee more particularly trained vp in his Schoole? meditate vpon the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles. And would ye be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the practiſes of that doctrine in the perſons of the primitiue Church? Caſt vp the Apoſtles Actes. And as to the Apocryphe bookes, I omit them, becauſe I am no Papiſt, as I ſaid before; and indeed ſome of them are no wayes like the dytement of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>But when ye reade the Scripture,
<note place="margin">How to reade the Scripture.</note> reade it with a ſanctified and chaſte heart: admire reuerently ſuch obſcure places as ye vnderſtand not, blaming onely your owne capacitie: read with delight the plaine places, and ſtudie carefully to vnderſtand thoſe that are ſomewhat difficile: preaſſe to bee a good textuarie; for the Scripture is euer the beſt interpreter of it ſelfe; but preaſſe not curiouſly to ſeeke out farther then is contained therein; for that were ouer vnmannerly a preſumption, to ſtriue to bee further vpon Gods ſecrets, then he hath will ye be; for what hee thought needfull for vs to know, that hath he reuealed there: And delyte moſt in reading ſuch parts of the Scripture, as may beſt ſerue for your inſtruction in your calling; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting fooliſh curioſities vpon genealogies and contentions,
<note place="margin">Tit. 3.9.</note> 
                  <hi>which are but vaine, and profite not,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>Now, as to Faith, which is the nouriſher and quickner of Religion,
<note place="margin">Faith the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſher of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> as I haue alreadie ſaid, It is a ſure perſwaſion and apprehenſion of the promiſes of God, applying them to your ſoule: and therefore may it iuſtly be called, the golden chaine that linketh the faithfull ſoule to Chriſt: And becauſe it groweth not in our garden, but <hi>is the free gift of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philip. 1.29.</note> as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, it muſt be nouriſhed by prayer, Which is nothing elſe, but a friendly talking with God.</p>
               <p>As for teaching you the forme of your prayers,
<note place="margin">Prayer, and whence to learne the beſt forme thereof.</note> the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid</hi> are the meeteſt ſchoole-maſter that ye can be acquainted with (next the prayer of our Sauiour, which is the onely rule of prayer) whereout of, as of moſt rich and pure fountaines, ye may learne all forme of prayer neceſſarie for your comfort at all occaſions: And ſo much the fitter are they for you, then for the common ſort, in reſpect the compoſer thereof was a King: and therefore beſt behoued to know a Kings wants, and what things were meeteſt to be required by a King at Gods hand for remedie thereof.</p>
               <p>Vſe often to pray when ye are quieteſt,

                  <note place="margin">Reu 7.14.</note> as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſaith. Aboue all then, my Sonne, labour to keepe ſound this conſcience, which many prattle of, but ouer few feele: eſpecially be carefull to keepe it free from two diſeaſes, wherewith it vſeth oft to be infected;
<note place="margin">The diſeaſes of conſcience.</note> to wit, Leaproſie, and Superſtition: the former is the mother of Atheiſme, the other of Hereſies. By a leaprouſe conſcience, I meane <hi>a cauterized conſcience,</hi>

<note place="margin">Laſt account.</note> Remember therefore in all your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of the great account that yee are one day to make: in all the dayes of your life, euer learning to die, and liuing euery day as it were your laſt;

               </p>
               <p>And therefore, I would not haue you to pray with the Papiſts, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued from ſuddaine death, but that God would giue you grace ſo to liue, as ye may euery houre of your life be ready for death: ſo ſhall ye attaine to the vertue of trew fortitude, neuer being afraid for the horrour of death,

<note place="margin">Fooliſh vſe of oathes.</note> and a ſinne cloathed with no delight nor gaine, and therefore the more inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable euen in the ſight of men: and lying commeth alſo much of a vile vſe, which baniſheth ſhame: Therfore beware euen to deny the trewth, which is a ſort of lie, that may beſt be eſchewed by a perſon of your ranke.

               <p>But learne wiſely to diſcerne betwixt points of ſaluation and indifferent

Wherefore deſtroy men innocent young ſucking Wolues and Foxes, but for the hatred they beare to their race? and why wil a coult of a Courſer of Naples, giue a greater price in a market, then an Aſſe-colt, but for loue of the race? It is therefore a thing monſtrous, to ſee a man loue the childe, and hate the Parents: as on the other part, the infaming and making odious of the parent, is the readieſt way to bring the ſonne in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. And for concluſion of this point, I may alſo alledge my owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: For beſides the iudgments of God, that with my eyes I haue ſeene fall vpon all them that were chiefe traitours to my parents, I may iuſtly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, I neuer found yet a conſtant biding by me in all my ſtraites, by any that were of perfite aage in my parents dayes, but onely by ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly bode by them; I meane ſpecially by them that ſerued the Queene my mother for ſo that I diſcharge my conſcience to you, my Sonne, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing to you the trewth, I care not, what any traitour or treaſon-allower thinke of it.</p>

<note place="margin">Of the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</note> I ſhortly comprehend them all in two ſorts of people: the one, that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in our maine land, that are barbarous for the moſt part, and yet mixed with ſome ſhewe of ciuilitie: the other, that dwelleth in the Iles, and are alluterly barbares, without any ſort or ſhew of ciuilitie.

               <p>But the principall bleſſing that yee can get of good companie,
<note place="margin">Of Mariage.</note> will ſtand in your marrying of a godly and vertuous wife: for ſhee muſt bee nearer vnto you,
<note place="margin">Gen. 2.23.</note> then any other companie, being <hi>Fleſh of your fleſh, and bone of your bone,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> ſaide of <hi>Heuah.</hi> And becauſe I know not but God may call mee, before ye be readie for Mariage; I will ſhortly ſet downe to you heere my aduice therein.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all conſider, that Mariage is the greateſt earthly felicitie or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie, that can come to a man, according as it pleaſeth God to bleſſe or curſe the ſame. Since then without the bleſſing of GOD, yee cannot looke for a happie ſucceſſe in Mariage, yee muſt bee carefull both in your preparation for it,
<note place="margin">Preparation to mariage.</note> and in the choice and vſage of your wife, to procure the ſame. By your preparation, I meane, that yee muſt keepe your bodie cleane and vnpolluted, till yee giue it to your wife, whom-to onely it belongeth. For how can ye iuſtly craue to bee ioyned with a pure vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, if your bodie be polluted? why ſhould the one halfe bee cleane, and the other defiled? And although I know, fornication is thought but a light and a veniall ſinne, by the moſt part of the world, yet remember well what I ſaid to you in my firſt Booke anent conſcience, and count euery ſinne and breach of Gods law, not according as the vaine world eſteemeth of it, but as God the Iudge and maker of the lawe accounteth of the ſame
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:23110:107"/>Heare God commanding by the mouth of <hi>Paul,</hi> to <hi>abstaine from fornication,</hi>

And then what ſhall come of him; but, as a man giuen ouer to his owne filthy affections, ſhall periſh into them? And becauſe wee are all of that nature, that ſibbeſt examples touch vs neereſt, conſider the difference of ſucceſſe that God granted in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of the King my grand-father, and me your owne father:
<note place="margin">A domeſticke example.</note> the reward of his incontinencie, (proceeding from his euill education) being the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine death at one time of two pleaſant yong Princes; and a daughter onely borne to ſucceed to him, whom hee had neuer the hap, ſo much as once to ſee or bleſſe before his death: leauing a double curſe behinde him to the land, both a Woman of ſexe, and a new borne babe of aage to raigne ouer them. And as for the bleſſing God hath beſtowed on mee, in gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me both a greater continencie, and the fruits following there-upon, your ſelfe, and ſib folkes to you, are (praiſe be to God) ſufficient witneſſes: which, I hope the ſame God of his infinite mercie, ſhall continue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, without repentance to me and my poſteritie. Be not aſhamed then, to keepe cleane your body, which is the Temple of the holy Spirit,

               <p>As for your choiſe in Mariage, reſpect chiefly the three cauſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mariage was firſt ordeined by God; and then ioyne three acceſſories, ſo farre as they may be obtained, not derogating to the principalles.</p>
               <p>The three cauſes it was ordeined for, are, for ſtaying of luſt,

Neither Marie yee,
<note place="margin">Id. cod.</note> for any acceſſory cauſe or worldly reſpects, a woman vnable, either through aage, nature, or accident, for procreation of children: for in a King that were a double fault, aſwell againſt his owne weale, as againſt the weale of his people. Neither alſo Marie one of knowne euill conditions, or vicious education: for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is ordeined to be a helper, and not a hinderer to man.

               </p>
               <p>The three acceſſories, which as I haue ſaid, ought alſo to be reſpected, without derogating to the principall cauſes, are beautie, riches, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:23110:108"/>by alliance, which are all bleſſings of God. For beautie increaſeth your loue to your Wife, contenting you the better with her, without caring for others: and riches and great alliance, doe both make her the abler to be a helper vnto you. But if ouer great reſpect being had to theſe acceſſories, the principall cauſes bee ouer-ſeene (which is ouer oft practiſed in the world) as of themſelues they are a bleſſing being well vſed; ſo the abuſe of them will turne them in a curſe. For what can all theſe worldly reſpects auaile, when a man ſhall finde himſelfe coupled with a diuel, to be one fleſh with him, and the halfe marrow in his bed? Then (though too late) ſhall he finde that beautie without bountie, wealth without wiſdome, and great friendſhip without grace and honeſtie; are but faire ſhewes, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull maſques of infinite miſeries.</p>
               <p>But haue ye reſpect, my Sonne, to theſe three ſpeciall cauſes in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<note place="margin">Matth. 13. A ſpecial cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> which flow from the firſt inſtitution thereof, <hi>&amp; caetera omnia adijcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur vobis.</hi> And therefore I would ratheſt haue you to Marie one that were fully of your owne Religion; her ranke and other qualities being agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your eſtate. For although that to my great regrate, the number of any Princes of power and account, profeſſing our Religion, bee but very ſmall; and that therefore this aduice ſeemes to be the more ſtrait and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile: yet ye haue deeply to weigh, and conſider vpon theſe doubts, how ye and your wife can bee of one fleſh, and keepe vnitie betwixt you, being members of two oppoſite Churches: diſagreement in Religion bringeth euer with it, diſagreement in maners; and the diſſention betwixt your Preachers and hers, wil breed and foſter a diſſention among your ſubiects, taking their example from your family; beſides the perill of the euill edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of your children. Neither pride you that ye wil be able to frame and make her as ye pleaſe: that deceiued <hi>Salomon</hi> the wiſeſt King that euer was; the grace of Perſeuerance, not being a flowre that groweth in our garden.</p>
               <p>Remember alſo that Mariage is one of the greateſt actions that a man doeth in all his time, eſpecially in taking of his firſt Wife: and if hee Marie firſt baſely beneath his ranke, he will euer be the leſſe accounted of there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.

So ſhal ye in your Mariage haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to your conſcience, honour, and naturall weale in your ſucceſſours.</p>
               <p>When yee are Maried, keepe inuiolably your promiſe made to God in your Mariage; which ſtandeth all in doing of one thing, and abſtayning from another: to treat her in all things as your wife, and the halfe of your ſelfe; and to make your body (which then is no more yours, but properly hers) common with none other.

                  </note> yet can I not vtterly condemne them; ſince they may at times ſupply the roome, which being emptie, would be patent to pernicious idleneſſe, <hi>quia nihil poteſt eſse vacuum.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. de luſ. al.</note> I will not therefore agree with the curioſitie of ſome learned men in our aage, in forbidding cardes, dice, and other ſuch like games of hazard; although otherwayes ſurely I reuerence them as nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and godly men: For they are deceiued therein, in founding their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon a miſtaken ground, which is, that the playing at ſuch games, is a kind of caſting of lot, and therefore vnlawfull; wherein they deceiue themſelues: For the caſting of lot was vſed for triall of the trewth in any obſcure thing, that otherwayes could not be gotten cleared; and therefore was a ſort of prophecie: whereby the contrary, no man goeth to any of theſe playes, to cleare any obſcure trewth, but onely to gage ſo much of his owne money, as hee pleaſeth, vpon the hazard of the running of the cardes or dice, aſwell as he would doe vpon the ſpeede of a horſe or a dog, or any ſuch like gaigeour: And ſo, if they be vnlawfull, all gaigeours vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vncertainties muſt likewayes be condemned: Not that thereby I take the defence of vaine carders and dicers, that waſte their moyen, and their time (whereof fewe conſider the pretiouſneſſe) vpon prodigall and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall playing:

                  </note> no, I would rather allow it to be diſcharged, where ſuch corruption cannot be eſchewed. But only I cannot condemne you at ſome times, when ye haue no other thing adoe (as a good King will be ſeldome) and are wearie of reading, or euill diſpoſed in your perſon, and when it is foule and ſtormie weather; then, I ſay, may ye lawfully play at the cardes or tables: For as to dicing, I thinke it becommeth beſt deboſhed ſouldiers to play at, on the head of their drums, being onely ruled by hazard, and ſubiect to knauiſh cogging. And as for the cheſſe, I thinke it ouer fond,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:23110:115"/>becauſe it is ouer-wiſe and Philoſophicke a folly: For where all ſuch light playes, are ordained to free mens heades for a time, from the faſhions thoughts on their affaires; it by the contrarie filleth and troubleth mens heades, with as many faſhious toyes of the play, as before it was filled with thoughts on his affaires.</p>
               <p>But in your playing, I would haue you to keepe three rules: firſt,
<note place="margin">Rules in playing.</note> or ye play, conſider yee doe it onely for your recreation, and reſolue to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the loſſe of all that ye play: and next, for that cauſe play no more then yee care to caſt among Pages: and laſt, play alwaies faire play preciſely, that ye come not in vſe of tricking and lying in ieaſt: otherwiſe, if yee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keepe theſe rules, my counſell is that yee allutterly abſtaine from theſe playes: For neither a madde paſſion for loſſe, nor falſhood vſed for deſire of gaine, can be called a play.</p>
               <p>Now, it is not onely lawfull, but neceſſarie,

And among others, no Common-wealth, that euer hath bene ſince the beginning, hath had greater need of the trew knowledge of this ground, then this our ſo long diſordered, and diſtracted Common-wealth hath: the misknowledge hereof being the onely ſpring, from whence haue flowed ſo many endleſſe calamities, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and confuſions, as is better felt by many, then the cauſe thereof well knowne, and deepely conſidered.

               <p>And therefore in the Coronation of our owne Kings, as well as of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian <hi>Monarche</hi> they giue their Oath, firſt to maintaine the Religion preſently profeſſed within their countrie, according to their lawes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is eſtabliſhed, and to puniſh all thoſe that ſhould preſſe to alter, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe the profeſſion thereof; And next to maintaine all the lowable and good Lawes made by their predeceſſours: to ſee them put in execution,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:23110:119"/>and the breakers and violaters thereof, to be puniſhed, according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the ſame: And laſtly, to maintaine the whole countrey, and euery ſtate therein, in all their ancient Priuiledges and Liberties, as well againſt all forreine enemies, as among themſelues: And ſhortly to procure the weale and flouriſhing of his people, not onely in maintaining and putting to execution the olde lowable lawes of the countrey, and by eſtabliſhing of new (as neceſſitie and euill maners will require) but by all other meanes poſſible to fore-ſee and preuent all dangers, that are likely to fall vpon them, and to maintaine concord, wealth, and ciuilitie among them, as a louing Father, and careful watchman, caring for them more then for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, knowing himſelfe to be ordained for them, and they not for him; and therefore countable to that great God, who placed him as his lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ouer them, vpon the perill of his ſoule to procure the weale of both ſoules and bodies, as farre as in him lieth, of all them that are committed to his charge. And this oath in the Coronation is the cleareſt, ciuill, and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Law, whereby the Kings office is properly defined.</p>
               <p>By the Law of Nature the King becomes a naturall Father to all his Lie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at his Coronation: And as the Father of his fatherly duty is bound to care for the nouriſhing, education, and vertuous gouernment of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; euen ſo is the king bound to care for all his ſubiects. As all the toile and paine that the father can take for his children, will be thought light and well beſtowed by him, ſo that the effect thereof redound to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and weale; ſo ought the Prince to doe towards his people. As the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father ought to foreſee all inconuenients and dangers that may ariſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his children, and though with the hazard of his owne perſon preſſe to preuent the ſame; ſo ought the King towards his people. As the fathers wrath and correction vpon any of his children that offendeth, ought to be by a fatherly chaſtiſement ſeaſoned with pitie, as long as there is any hope of amendment in them; ſo ought the King towards any of his Lieges that offend in that meaſure. And ſhortly, as the Fathers chiefe ioy ought to be in procuring his childrens welfare, reioycing at their weale, ſorrowing and pitying at their euill, to hazard for their ſafetie, trauell for their reſt, wake for their ſleepe; and in a word, to thinke that his earthly felicitie and life ſtandeth and liueth more in them, nor in himſelfe; ſo ought a good Prince thinke of his people.</p>
               <p>As to the other branch of this mutuall and reciprock band, is the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and alleageance that the Lieges owe to their King: the ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I take out of the words of <hi>Samuel,</hi> dited by Gods Spirit, when God had giuen him commandement to heare the peoples voice in chooſing and annointing them a King. And becauſe that place of Scripture being well vnderſtood, is ſo pertinent for our purpoſe, I haue inſert herein the very words of the Text.</p>

               <p>That theſe words, and diſcourſes of <hi>Samuel</hi> were dited by Gods Spirit, it needs no further probation, but that it is a place of Scripture; ſince the whole Scripture is dited by that inſpiration, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: which ground no good Chriſtian will, or dare denie. Whereupon it muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that theſe ſpeeches proceeded not from any ambition in <hi>Samuel,</hi> as one loath to quite the reines that he ſo long had ruled, and therefore deſirous, by making odious the gouernment of a King, to diſſwade the people from their farther importunate crauing of one: For, as the text proueth it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he then conueened them to giue them a reſolute grant of their demand, as God by his owne mouth commanded him, ſaying,
<q>Hearken to the voice of the people.</q> And to preſſe to diſſwade them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, which he then came to grant vnto them, were a thing very impertinent in a wiſe man; much more in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the moſt high God. And likewiſe, it well appeared in all the courſe of his life after, that his ſo long refuſing of their ſute before came not of any ambition in him: which he well proued in praying, &amp; as it were importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God for the weale of <hi>Saul.</hi> Yea, after God had declared his reprobation vnto him, yet he deſiſted not, while God himſelfe was wrath at his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:23110:120"/>and diſcharged his fathers ſuit in that errand. And that theſe words of <hi>Samuel</hi> were not vttered as a prophecie of <hi>Saul</hi> their firſt Kings defection, it well appeareth, as well becauſe we heare no mention made in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any his tyrannie and oppreſſion, (which, if it had beene, would not haue been left vnpainted out therein, as well as his other faults were, as in a trew mirrour of all the Kings behauiours, whom it deſcribeth) as likewiſe in reſpect that <hi>Saul</hi> was choſen by God for his vertue, and meet qualities to gouerne his people: whereas his defection ſprung after-hand from the corruption of his owne nature, &amp; not through any default in God, whom they that thinke ſo, would make as a ſtep-father to his people, in making wilfully a choiſe of the vnmeeteſt for gouerning them, ſince the election of that King lay abſolutely and immediatly in Gods hand. But by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it is plaine, and euident, that this ſpeech of <hi>Samuel</hi> to the people, was to prepare their hearts before the hand to the due obedience of that King, which God was to giue vnto them; and therefore opened vp vnto them, what might be the intollerable qualities that might fall in ſome of their kings, thereby preparing them to patience, not to reſiſt to Gods ordinance: but as he would haue ſaid; Since God hath granted your importunate ſuit in giuing you a king, as yee haue elſe committed an errour in ſhaking off Gods yoke, and ouer-haſtie ſeeking of a King; ſo beware yee fall not into the next, in caſting off alſo raſhly that yoke, which God at your earneſt ſuite hath laid vpon you, how hard that euer it ſeeme to be: For as ye could not haue obtained one without the permiſſion and ordinance of God, ſo may yee no more, fro hee be once ſet ouer you, ſhake him off without the ſame warrant. And therefore in time arme yourſelues with patience and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, ſince he that hath the only power to make him, hath the onely power to vnmake him, and ye onely to obey, bearing with theſe ſtraits that I now foreſhew you, as with the finger of God, which lieth not in you to take off.</p>
               <p>And will ye conſider the very wordes of the text in order, as they are ſet downe, it ſhall plainely declare the obedience that the people owe to their King in all reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, God commandeth <hi>Samuel</hi> to doe two things: the one, to grant the people their ſuit in giuing them a king; the other, to forewarne them, what ſome kings will doe vnto them, that they may not thereafter in their grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and murmuring ſay, when they ſhal feele the ſnares here fore-ſpoken; We would neuer haue had a king of God, in caſe when we craued him, hee had let vs know how wee would haue beene vſed by him, as now we finde but ouer-late. And this is meant by theſe words:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now therefore hearken vnto their voice: howbeit yet testifie vnto them, and ſhew them the maner of the King that ſhall rule ouer them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And next, <hi>Samuel</hi> in execution of this commandement of God, hee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe doeth two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, hee declares vnto them, what points of iuſtice and equitie their king will breake in his behauiour vnto them: And next he putteth them
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:23110:121"/>out of hope, that wearie as they will, they ſhall not haue leaue to ſhake off that yoke, which God through their importunitie hath laide vpon them. The points of equitie that the King ſhall breake vnto them, are expreſſed in theſe words:
<list>
                     <item>11 <hi>He will take your ſonnes, and appoint them to his Charets, and to be his horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſome ſhall run before his Charet.</hi>

                     <item>12 <hi>Alſo he will make them his captaines ouer thouſands, and captaines ouer fifties, and to eare his ground, and to reape his harueſt, and to make inſtruments of warre, and the things that ſerue for his charets.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>13 <hi>He will alſo take your daughters, and make them Apothecaries, and Cookes, and Bakers.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The points of Iuſtice, that hee ſhall breake vnto them, are expreſſed in theſe wordes:

                     <item>14 <hi>Hee will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your best Oliue trees, and giue them to his ſeruants.</hi>

                     <item>15 <hi>And he will take the tenth of your ſeede, and of your vineyards, and giue it to his Eunuches and to his ſeruants: and alſo the tenth of your ſheepe.</hi>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>As if he would ſay; The beſt and nobleſt of your blood ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled in ſlauiſh and ſeruile offices to ſerue him: And not content of his owne patrimonie, will make vp a rent to his owne vſe out of your beſt lands, vineyards, orchards, and ſtore of cattell: So as inuerting the Law of nature, and office of a King, your perſons and the perſons of your poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, together with your lands, and all that ye poſſeſſe ſhal ſerue his priuate vſe, and inordinate appetite.</p>
               <p>And as vnto the next point (which is his fore-warning them, that, weary as they will, they ſhall not haue leaue to ſhake off the yoke, which God tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their importunity hath laid vpon them) it is expreſſed in theſe words:
<list>
                     <item>18 <hi>And yee ſhall crie out at that day, becauſe of your King whom yee haue choſen you: and the Lord will not heare you at that day.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>As he would ſay; When ye ſhall finde theſe things in proofe that now I fore-warne you of, although you ſhall grudge and murmure, yet it ſhal not be lawful to you to caſt it off, in reſpect it is not only the ordinance of God, but alſo your ſelues haue choſen him vnto you, thereby renouncing for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all priuiledges, by your willing conſent out of your hands, whereby in any time hereafter ye would claime, and call backe vnto your ſelues againe that power, which God ſhall not permit you to doe. And for further taking away of all excuſe, and retraction of this their contract, after their conſent to vnder-lie this yoke with all the burthens that hee hath declared vnto them, he craues their anſwere, and conſent to his propoſition: which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by their anſwere, as it is expreſſed in theſe words:
<list>
                     <item>19 <hi>Nay, but there ſhalbe a King ouer vs.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>20 <hi>And we alſo will be like all other nations: and our king ſhall iudge vs, and goe out before vs and fight our battels.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>As if they would haue ſaid; All your ſpeeches and hard conditions ſhall not skarre vs, but we will take the good and euill of it vpon vs, and we will
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:23110:121"/>be content to beare whatſoeuer burthen it ſhal pleaſe our King to lay vpon vs, aſwell as other nations doe. And for the good we will get of him in fighting our battels, we will more patiently beare any burthen that ſhall pleaſe him to lay on vs.</p>
               <p>Now then, ſince the erection of this Kingdome and Monarchie among the Iewes, and the law thereof may, and ought to bee a paterne to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and well founded Monarchies, as beeing founded by God himſelfe, who by his Oracle, and out of his owne mouth gaue the law thereof: what liberty can broiling ſpirits, and rebellious minds claime iuſtly to againſt any Chriſtian Monarchie; ſince they can claime to no greater libertie on their part, nor the people of God might haue done, and no greater tyranny was euer executed by any Prince or tyrant, whom they can obiect, nor was here fore-warned to the people of God, (and yet all rebellion counterman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto them) if tyrannizing ouer mens perſons, ſonnes, daughters and ſeruants; redacting noble houſes, and men, and women of noble blood, to ſlauiſh and ſcruile offices; and extortion, and ſpoile of their lands and goods to the princes owne priuate vſe and commoditie, and of his courteours, and ſeruants, may be called a tyrannie?</p>
               <p>And that this propoſition grounded vpon the Scripture, may the more clearely appeare to be trew by the practiſe often prooued in the ſame booke, we neuer reade, that euer the Prophets perſwaded the people to rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Prince, how wicked ſoeuer he was.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Samuel</hi> by Gods command pronounced to the ſame king <hi>Saul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15.</note> that his kingdome was rent from him, and giuen to another (which in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was a degrading of him) yet his next action following that, was peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to turne home, and with floods of teares to pray to God to haue ſome compaſſion vpon him.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Dauid,</hi> notwithſtanding hee was inaugurate in that ſame degraded Kings roome, not onely (when he was cruelly perſecuted, for no offence; but good ſeruice done vnto him) would not preſume, hauing him in his power, skantly, but with great reuerence, to touch the garment of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted of the Lord, and in his words bleſſed him: but likewiſe,
<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2 4. 2. Sam. 1.</note> when one came to him vanting himſelfe vntrewly to haue ſlaine <hi>Saul,</hi> hee, without forme of proces, or triall of his guilt, cauſed onely for guiltineſſe of his tongue, put him to ſodaine death.</p>
               <p>And although there was neuer a more monſtrous perſecutor, and tyrant nor <hi>Achab</hi> was: yet all the rebellion, that <hi>Elias</hi> euer raiſed againſt him, was to flie to the wildernes: where for fault of ſuſtentation, he was fed with the Corbies. And I thinke no man will doubt but <hi>Samuel, Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> had as great power to perſwade the people, if they had liked to haue employed their credite to vproares &amp; rebellions againſt theſe wicked kings, as any of our ſeditious preachers in theſe daies of whatſoeuer religion, either in this countrey or in France, had, that buſied themſelues moſt to ſtir vp rebellion vnder cloake of religion. This farre the only loue of veritie, I proteſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:23110:122"/>hatred at their perſons, haue mooued me to be ſomewhat ſatyricke.</p>
               <p>And if any will leane to the extraordinarie examples of degrading or killing of kings in the Scriptures, thereby to cloake the peoples rebellion, as by the deed of <hi>Iehu,</hi> and ſuch like extraordinaries: I anſwere, beſides that they want the like warrant that they had, if extraordinarie examples of the Scripture ſhall bee drawne in daily practiſe; murther vnder traiſt as in the perſons of <hi>Ahud,</hi> and <hi>Iael;</hi> theft, as in the perſons of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> comming out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> lying to their parents to the hurt of their brother, as in the perſon of <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſhall all be counted as lawfull and allowable vertues, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt Princes. And to conclude, the practiſe through the whole Scripture prooueth the peoples obedience giuen to that ſentence in the law of God:
<q>Thou ſhalt not rayle vpon the Iudges, neither ſpeake euill of the ruler of thy people.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To end then the ground of my propoſition taken out of the Scripture, let two ſpeciall, and notable examples, one vnder the law, another vnder the Euangel,
<note place="margin">Ier. 27.</note> conclude this part of my alleageance. Vnder the lawe, <hi>Ieremie</hi> threatneth the people of God with vtter deſtruction for rebellion to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezar</hi> the king of Babel: who although he was an idolatrous perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a forraine King, a Tyrant, and vſurper of their liberties; yet in reſpect they had once receiued and acknowledged him for their king, he not only commandeth them to obey him,
<note place="margin">Iere. 29.</note> but euen to pray for his proſperitie, adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the reaſon to it; becauſe in his proſperitie ſtood their peace.</p>
               <p>And vnder the Euangel, that king, whom <hi>Paul</hi> bids the <hi>Romanes obey</hi> and ſerue <hi>for conſcience ſake,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 13.</note> was <hi>Nero</hi> that bloody tyrant, an infamie to his aage, and a monſter to the world, being alſo an idolatrous perſecuter, as the King of <hi>Babel</hi> was. If then Idolatrie and defection from God, tyranny o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their people, and perſecution of the Saints, for their profeſſion ſake, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred not the Spirit of God to command his people vnder all higheſt paine to giue them all due and heartie obedience for conſcience ſake, giuing to <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which was <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and to God that which was Gods, as Chriſt ſaith; and that this practiſe throughout the booke of God agreeth with this lawe, which he made in the erection of that Monarchie (as is at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deduced) what ſhameleſſe preſumption is it to any Chriſtian people now adayes to claime to that vnlawfull libertie, which God refuſed to his owne peculiar and choſen people? Shortly then to take vp in two or three ſentences, grounded vpon all theſe arguments, out of the lawe of God, the duetie, and alleageance of the people to their lawfull king, their obedience, I ſay, ought to be to him, as to Gods Lieutenant in earth, obeying his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in all things, except directly againſt God, as the commands of Gods Miniſter, acknowledging him a Iudge ſet by GOD ouer them, hauing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to iudge them, but to be iudged onely by GOD, whom to onely hee muſt giue count of his iudgement; fearing him as their Iudge; louing him as their father; praying for him as their protectour; for his continuance, if
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:23110:122"/>he be good; for his amendement, if he be wicked; following and obeying his lawfull commaunds, eſchewing and flying his fury in his vnlawfull, without reſiſtance, but by ſobbes and teares to God, according to that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence vſed in the primitiue Church in the time of the perſecution.</p>
               <q>Preces, &amp; Lachrymae ſunt arma Eccleſiae.</q>
               <p>Now, as for the deſcribing the alleageance, that the lieges owe to their natiue King, out of the fundamentall and ciuill Lawe, eſpecially of this countrey, as I promiſed, the ground muſt firſt be ſet downe of the firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of eſtabliſhing the Lawes and forme of gouernement among vs; that the ground being firſt right laide, we may thereafter build rightly thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Although it be trew (according to the affirmation of thoſe that pryde themſelues to be the ſcourges of Tyrants) that in the firſt beginning of Kings riſing among Gentiles, in the time of the firſt aage, diuers common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths and ſocieties of men chooſed out one among themſelues, who for his vertues and valour, being more eminent then the reſt, was choſen out by them, and ſet vp in that roome, to maintaine the weakeſt in their right, to throw downe oppreſſours, and to foſter and continue the ſocietie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men; which could not otherwiſe, but by vertue of that vnitie be wel done: yet theſe examples are nothing pertinent to vs; becauſe our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and diuers other Monarchies are not in that caſe, but had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in a farre contrary faſhion.</p>
               <p>For as our Chronicles beare witneſſe, this Ile, and eſpecially our part of it, being ſcantly inhabited, but by very few, and they as barbarous and ſcant of ciuilitie, as number, there comes our firſt King <hi>Fergus,</hi> with a great number with him, out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which was long inhabited before vs, and making himſelfe maſter of the countrey, by his owne friendſhip, and force, as well of the <hi>Ireland-men</hi> that came with him, as of the countrey-men that willingly fell to him, hee made himſelfe King and Lord, as well of the whole landes, as of the whole inhabitants within the ſame. Thereafter he and his ſucceſſours, a long while after their being Kinges, made and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed their lawes from time to time, and as the occaſion required. So the trewth is directly contrarie in our ſtate to the falſe affirmation of ſuch ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious writers, as would perſwade vs, that the Lawes and ſtate of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey were eſtabliſhed before the admitting of a king: where by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ye ſee it plainely prooued, that a wiſe king comming in among barbares, firſt eſtabliſhed the eſtate and forme of gouernement, and thereafter made lawes by himſelfe, and his ſucceſſours according thereto.</p>
               <p>The kings therefore in <hi>Scotland</hi> were before any eſtates or rankes of men within the ſame, before any Parliaments were holden, or lawes made: and by them was the land diſtributed (which at the firſt was whole theirs) ſtates erected and decerned, and formes of gouernement deuiſed and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed: And ſo it followes of neceſſitie, that the kings were the authors and makers of the Lawes, and not the Lawes of the kings. And to prooue this my aſſertion more clearly, it is euident by the rolles of our Chancellery
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:23110:123"/>(which containe our eldeſt and fundamentall Lawes) that the King is <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus omnium bonorum,</hi> and <hi>Dominus directus totius Dominij,</hi> the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects being but his vaſſals, and from him holding all their lands as their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-lord, who according to good ſeruices done vnto him, chaungeth their holdings from tacke to few, from ward to blanch, erecteth new Baronies, and vniteth olde, without aduice or authoritie of either Parliament, or any other ſubalterin iudiciall ſeate: So as if wrong might bee admitted in play (albeit I grant wrong ſhould be wrong in all perſons) the King might haue a better colour for his pleaſure, without further reaſon, to take the land from his lieges, as ouer-lord of the whole, and doe with it as pleaſeth him, ſince all that they hold is of him, then, as fooliſh writers ſay, the people might vnmake the king, and put an other in his roome: But either of them as vnlawful, and againſt the ordinance of God, ought to be alike odious to be thought, much leſſe put in practiſe.</p>
               <p>And according to theſe fundamentall Lawes already alledged, we daily ſee that in the Parliament (which is nothing elſe but the head Court of the king and his vaſſals) the lawes are but craued by his ſubiects, and onely made by him at their rogation, and with their aduice: For albeit the king make daily ſtatutes and ordinances, enioyning ſuch paines thereto as hee thinkes meet, without any aduice of Parliament or eſtates; yet it lies in the power of no Parliament, to make any kinde of Lawe or Statute, without his Scepter be to it, for giuing it the force of a Law: And although diuers changes haue beene in other countries of the blood Royall, and kingly houſe, the kingdome being reft by conqueſt from one to another, as in our neighbour countrey in <hi>England,</hi> (which was neuer in ours) yet the ſame ground of the kings right ouer all the land, and ſubiects thereof remaineth alike in all other free Monarchies, as well as in this: For when the Baſtard of <hi>Normandie</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> and made himſelfe king, was it not by force, and with a mighty army? Where he gaue the Law, and tooke none, changed the Lawes, inuerted the order of gouernement, ſet downe the ſtrangers his followers in many of the old poſſeſſours roomes, as at this day well appeareth a great part of the Gentlemen in <hi>England,</hi> beeing come of the <hi>Norman</hi> blood, and their old Lawes, which to this day they are ruled by, are written in his language, and not in theirs: And yet his ſucceſſours haue with great happineſſe enioyed the Crowne to this day; Whereof the like was alſo done by all them that conqueſted them before.</p>
               <p>And for concluſion of this point, that the king is ouer-lord ouer the whole lands, it is likewiſe daily proued by the Law of our hoordes, of want of Heires, and of Baſtardies: For if a hoord be found vnder the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is no more in the keeping or vſe of any perſon, it of the law pertains to the king. If a perſon, inheritour of any lands or goods, dye without any ſort of heires, all his landes and goods returne to the king. And if a baſtard die vnrehabled without heires of his bodie (which rehabling one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lyes in the kings hands) all that hee hath likewiſe returnes to the king.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:23110:123"/>And as ye ſee it manifeſt, that the King is ouer-Lord of the whole land: ſo is he Maſter ouer euery perſon that inhabiteth the ſame, hauing power ouer the life and death of euery one of them: For although a iuſt Prince will not take the life of any of his ſubiects without a cleare law; yet the ſame lawes whereby he taketh them, are made by himſelfe, or his predeceſſours; and ſo the power flowes alwaies from him ſelfe; as by daily experience we ſee, good and iuſt Princes will from time to time make new lawes and ſtatutes, adioyning the penalties to the breakers thereof, which before the law was made, had beene no crime to the ſubiect to haue committed. Not that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the old definition of a King, and of a law; which makes the king to bee a ſpeaking law, and the Law a dumbe king: for certainely a king that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes not by his lawe, can neither be countable to God for his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, nor haue a happy and eſtabliſhed raigne: For albeit it be trew that I haue at length prooued, that the King is aboue the law, as both the author and giuer of ſtrength thereto; yet a good king will not onely delight to rule his ſubiects by the lawe, but euen will conforme himſelfe in his owne actions thereuneto, alwaies keeping that ground, that the health of the common-wealth be his chiefe lawe: And where he ſees the lawe doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome or rigorous, hee may interpret or mitigate the ſame, leſt otherwiſe <hi>Summum ius</hi> bee <hi>ſumma iniuria:</hi> And therefore generall lawes, made publikely in Parliament, may vpon knowen reſpects to the King by his authoritie bee mitigated, and ſuſpended vpon cauſes onely knowen to him.</p>
               <p>As likewiſe, although I haue ſaid, a good king will frame all his actions to be according to the Law; yet is hee not bound thereto but of his good will, and for good example-giuing to his ſubiects: For as in the law of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from eating of fleſh in <hi>Lenton,</hi> the king will, for examples ſake, make his owne houſe to obſerue the Law; yet no man will thinke he needs to take a licence to eate fleſh. And although by our Lawes, the bearing and wearing of hag-buts, and piſtolets be forbidden, yet no man can find any fault in the King, for cauſing his traine vſe them in any raide vpon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, or other malefactours or rebellious ſubiects. So as I haue alreadie ſaid, a good King, although hee be aboue the Law, will ſubiect and frame his actions thereto, for examples ſake to his ſubiects, and of his owne free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, but not as ſubiect or bound thereto.</p>
               <p>Since I haue ſo clearely prooued then out of the fundamentall lawes and practiſe of this country, what right &amp; power a king hath ouer his land and ſubiects, it is eaſie to be vnderſtood, what allegeance &amp; obedience his lieges owe vnto him; I meane alwaies of ſuch free Monarchies as our king is, and not of electiue kings, and much leſſe of ſuch ſort of gouernors, as the dukes of <hi>Venice</hi> are, whoſe Ariſtocratick and limited gouernment, is nothing like to free Monarchies; although the malice of ſome writers hath not beene aſhamed to mis-know any difference to be betwixt them. And if it be not lawfull to any particular Lordes tenants or vaſſals, vpon whatſoeuer
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:23110:124"/>pretext, to controll and diſplace their Maſter, and ouer-lord (as is clearer nor the Sunne by all Lawes of the world) how much leſſe may the ſubiects and vaſſals of the great ouer-lord the KING controll or diſplace him? And ſince in all inferiour iudgements in the land, the people may not vpon any reſpects diſplace their Magiſtrates, although but ſubaltern: for the people of a borough, cannot diſplace their Prouoſt before the time of their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: nor in Eccleſiaſticall policie the flocke can vpon any pretence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place the Paſtor, nor iudge of him: yea euen the poore Schoolemaſter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſplaced by his ſchollers: If theſe, I ſay (whereof ſome are but infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, ſubaltern, and temporall Magiſtrates, and none of them equall in any ſort to the dignitie of a King) cannot be diſplaced for any occaſion or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text by them that are ruled by them: how much leſſe is it lawfull vpon any pretext to controll or diſplace the great Prouoſt, and great Schoole-maſter of the whole land: except by inuerting the order of all Law and reaſon, the commanded may be made to command their commander, the iudged to iudge their Iudge, and they that are gouerned, to gouerne their time about their Lord and gouernour.</p>
               <p>And the agreement of the Law of nature in this our ground with the Lawes and conſtitutions of God, and man, already alledged, will by two ſimilitudes eaſily appeare. The King towards his people is rightly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a father of children, and to a head of a body compoſed of diuers members: For as fathers, the good Princes, and Magiſtrates of the people of God acknowledged themſelues to their ſubiects. And for all other well ruled Common-wealths, the ſtile of <hi>Pater patriae</hi> was euer, and is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſed to Kings. And the proper office of a King towards his Subiects, agrees very wel with the office of the head towards the body, and all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof: For from the head, being the ſeate of Iudgement, proceedeth the care and foreſight of guiding, and preuenting all euill that may come to the body or any part thereof. The head cares for the body, ſo doeth the King for his people. As the diſcourſe and direction flowes from the head, and the execution according thereunto belongs to the reſt of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, euery one according to their office: ſo is it betwixt a wiſe Prince, and his people. As the iudgement comming from the head may not onely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the members, euery one in their owne office, as long as they are able for it; but likewiſe in caſe any of them be affected with any infirmitie muſt care and prouide for their remedy, in-caſe it be curable, and if otherwiſe, gar cut them off for feare of infecting of the reſt: euen ſo is it betwixt the Prince, and his people. And as there is euer hope of curing any diſeaſed member by the direction of the head, as long as it is whole; but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if it be troubled, all the members are partakers of that paine, ſo is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Prince and his people.</p>
               <p>And now firſt for the fathers part (whoſe naturall loue to his children I deſcribed in the firſt part of this my diſcourſe, ſpeaking of the dutie that Kings owe to their Subiects) conſider, I pray you what duetie his children
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:23110:124"/>owe to him, &amp; whether vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any pretext whatſoeuer, it wil not be thought monſtrous and vnnaturall to his ſons, to riſe vp againſt him, to control him at their appetite, and when they thinke good to ſley him, or to cut him off, and adopt to themſelues any other they pleaſe in his roome: Or can any pretence of wickednes or rigor on his part be a iuſt excuſe for his children to put hand into him? And although wee ſee by the courſe of nature, that loue vſeth to deſcend more then to aſcend, in caſe it were trew, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hated and wronged the children neuer ſo much, will any man, endued with the leaſt ſponke of reaſon, thinke it lawfull for them to meet him with the line? Yea, ſuppoſe the father were furiouſly following his ſonnes with a drawen ſword, is it lawfull for them to turne and ſtrike againe, or make any reſiſtance but by flight? I thinke ſurely, if there were no more but the example of bruit beaſts &amp; vnreaſonable creatures, it may ſerue well enough to qualifie and proue this my argnment. We reade often the pietie that the Storkes haue to their olde and decayed parents: And generally wee know, that there are many ſorts of beaſts and fowles, that with violence and many bloody ſtrokes will beat and baniſh their yong ones from them, how ſoone they perceiue them to be able to fend themſelues; but wee neuer read or heard of any reſiſtance on their part, except among the vipers; which prooues ſuch perſons, as ought to be reaſonable creatures, and yet vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follow this example, to be endued with their viperous nature.</p>
               <p>And for the ſimilitude of the head and the body, it may very well fall out that the head will be forced to garre cut off ſome rotten member (as I haue already ſaid) to keepe the reſt of the body in integritie: but what ſtate the body can be in, if the head, for any infirmitie that can fall to it, be cut off, I leaue it to the readers iudgement.</p>
               <p>So as (to conclude this part) if the children may vpon any pretext that can be imagined, lawfully riſe vp againſt their Father, cut him off, &amp; chooſe any other whom they pleaſe in his roome; and if the body for the weale of it, may for any infirmitie that can be in the head, ſtrike it off, then I cannot deny that the people may rebell, controll, and diſplace, or cut off their king at their owne pleaſure, and vpon reſpects moouing them. And whether theſe ſimilitudes repreſent better the office of a King, or the offices of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or Deacons of crafts, or Doctors in Phyſicke (which iolly compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are vſed by ſuch writers as maintaine the contrary propoſition) I leaue it alſo to the readers diſcretion.</p>
               <p>And in caſe any doubts might ariſe in any part of this treatiſe, I wil (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my promiſe) with the ſolution of foure principall and moſt weightie doubts, that the aduerſaries may obiect, conclude this diſcourſe. And firſt it is caſten vp by diuers, that employ their pennes vpon Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies for rebellions and treaſons that euery man is borne to carry ſuch a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall zeale and duety to his common-wealth, as to his mother; that ſeeing it ſo rent and deadly wounded, as whiles it will be by wicked and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Kings, good Citizens will be forced, for the naturall zeale and duety
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:23110:125"/>they owe to their owne natiue countrey, to put their hand to worke for freeing their common-wealth from ſuch a peſt.</p>
               <p>Whereunto I giue two anſweres: Firſt, it is a ſure Axiome in <hi>Theologie,</hi> that euill ſhould not be done, that good may come of it: The wickedneſſe therefore of the King can neuer make them that are ordained to be iudged by him, to become his Iudges. And if it be not lawfull to a priuate man to reuenge his priuate iniury vpon his priuate aduerſary (ſince God hath one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen the ſword to the Magiſtrate) how much leſſe is it lawfull to the people, or any part of them (who all are but priuate men, the authoritie being alwayes with the Magiſtrate, as I haue already proued) to take vpon them the vſe of the ſword, whom to it belongs not, againſt the publicke Magiſtrate, whom to onely it belongeth.</p>
               <p>Next, in place of relieuing the common-wealth out of diſtreſſe (which is their onely excuſe and colour) they ſhall heape double diſtreſſe and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon it; and ſo their rebellion ſhall procure the contrary effects that they pretend it for: For a king cannot be imagined to be ſo vnruly and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous, but the common-wealth will be kept in better order, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thereof, by him, then it can be by his way-taking. For firſt, all ſudden mutations are perillous in common-wealths, hope being thereby giuen to all bare men to ſet vp themſelues, and flie with other mens fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the reines being looſed to all the inſolencies that diſordered people can commit by hope of impunitie, becauſe of the looſeneſſe of all things.</p>
               <p>And next, it is certaine that a king can neuer be ſo monſtrouſly vicious, but hee will generally fauour iuſtice, and maintaine ſome order, except in the particulars, wherein his inordinate luſtes and paſſions cary him away; where by the contrary, no King being, nothing is vnlawfull to none: And ſo the olde opinion of the Philoſophers prooues trew, That better it is to liue in a Common-wealth, where nothing is lawfull, then where all things are lawfull to all men; the Common-wealth at that time reſembling an vndanted young horſe that hath caſten his rider: For as the diuine Poet DV BARTAS ſayth, <hi>Better it were to ſuffer ſome diſorder in the eſtate, and ſome ſpots in the Common-wealth, then in pretending to reforme, vtterly to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Republicke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond obiection they ground vpon the curſe that hangs ouer the common-wealth, where a wicked king reigneth: and, ſay they, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a more acceptable deed in the ſight of God, nor more dutiful to their common-weale, then to free the countrey of ſuch a curſe, and vindicate to them their libertie, which is naturall to all creatures to craue.</p>
               <p>Whereunto for anſwere, I grant indeed, that a wicked king is ſent by God for a curſe to his people, and a plague for their ſinnes: but that it is lawfull to them to ſhake off that curſe at their owne hand, which God hath laid on them, that I deny, and may ſo do iuſtly. Will any deny that the king of <hi>Babel</hi> was a curſe to the people of God, as was plainly fore-ſpoken and threatned vnto them in the prophecie of their captiuitie? And what was <hi>Nero</hi> to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:23110:125"/>the Chriſtian Church in his time? And yet <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> (as yee haue elſe heard) commanded them not onely to obey them, but heartily to pray for their welfare.</p>
               <p>It is certaine then (as I haue already by the Law of God ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) that patience, earneſt prayers to God, and amendment of their liues, are the onely lawful meanes to moue God to relieue them of that heauie curſe. As for vindicating to themſelues their owne libertie, what lawfull power haue they to reuoke to themſelues againe thoſe priuiledges, which by their owne conſent before were ſo fully put out of their hands? for if a Prince cannot iuſtly bring backe againe to himſelf the priuiledges once beſtowed by him or his predeceſſors vpon any ſtate or ranke of his ſubiects; how much leſſe may the ſubiects reaue out of the princes hand that ſuperioritie, which he and his Predeceſſors haue ſo long brooked ouer them?</p>
               <p>But the vnhappy iniquitie of the time, which hath oft times giuen ouer good ſucceſſe to their treaſonable attempts, furniſheth them the ground of their third obiection: For, ſay they, the fortunate ſucceſſe that God hath ſo oft giuen to ſuch enterpriſes, prooueth plainely by the practiſe, that God fauoured the iuſtneſſe of their quarrell.</p>
               <p>To the which I anſwere, that it is trew indeed, that all the ſucceſſe of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, as well as other worldly things, lyeth onely in Gods hand: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that in the Scripture he takes to himſelfe the ſtyle of God of Hoſts. But vpon that generall to conclude, that hee euer giues victory to the iuſt quarrell, would prooue the <hi>Philistims,</hi> and diuers other neighbour enemies of the people of God to haue oft times had the iuſt quarrel againſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, in reſpect of the many victories they obtained againſt them. And by that ſame argument they had alſo iuſt quarrell againſt the Arke of God: For they wan it in the field, and kept it long priſoner in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. As likewiſe by all good Writers, as well Theologues, as other, the Duels and ſingular combats are diſallowed; which are onely made vpon pretence, that GOD will kith thereby the iuſtice of the quarrell: For wee muſt conſider that the innocent partie is not innocent before God: And therefore God will make oft times them that haue the wrong ſide reuenge iuſtly his quarrell; and when he hath done, caſt his ſcourge in the fire; as he oft times did to his owne people, ſtirring vp and ſtrengthening their enemies, while they were humbled in his ſight, and then deliuered them in their hands. So God, as the great Iudge may iuſtly puniſh his Deputie, and for his rebellion againſt him, ſtir vp his rebels to meet him with the like: And when it is done, the part of the inſtrument is no better then the diuels part is in tempting and torturing ſuch as God committeth to him as his hangman to doe: Therefore, as I ſaid in the beginning, it is oft times a very deceiueable argument, to iudge of the cauſe by the euent.</p>
               <p>And the laſt obiection is grounded vpon the mutuall paction and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipulation (as they call it) betwixt the King and his people, at the time of his coronation: For there, ſay they, there is a mutuall paction, and contract
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:23110:126"/>bound vp, and ſworne betwixt the king, and the people: Whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that if the one part of the contract or the Indent bee broken vpon the Kings ſide, the people are no longer bound to keepe their part of it, but are thereby freed of their oath: For (ſay they) a contract betwixt two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of all Law frees the one partie, if the other breake vnto him.</p>
               <p>As to this contract alledged made at the coronation of a King, although I deny any ſuch contract to bee made then, eſpecially containing ſuch a clauſe irritant as they alledge; yet I confeſſe, that a king at his coronation, or at the entry to his kingdome, willingly promiſeth to his people, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge honorably and trewly the office giuen him by God ouer them: But preſuming that thereafter he breake his promiſe vnto them neuer ſo inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable; the queſtion is, who ſhould bee iudge of the breake, giuing vnto them, this contractwere made vnto them neuer ſo ſicker, according to their alleageance. I thinke no man that hath but the ſmalleſt entrance into the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Law, will doubt that of all Law, either ciuil or municipal of any nation, a contract cannot be thought broken by the one partie, and ſo the other likewiſe to be freed therefro, except that firſt a lawfull triall and cognition be had by the ordinary Iudge of the breakers thereof: Or elſe euery man may be both party and Iudge in his owne cauſe; which is abſurd once to be thought. Now in this contract (I ſay) betwixt the king and his people, God is doubtles the only Iudge, both becauſe to him onely the king muſt make count of his adminiſtration (as is oft ſaid before) as likewiſe by the oath in the coronation, God is made iudge and reuenger of the breakers: For in his preſence, as only iudge of oaths, all oaths ought to be made. Then ſince God is the onely Iudge betwixt the two parties contractors, the cognition and reuenge muſt onely appertaine to him: It followes therefore of neceſſitie, that God muſt firſt giue ſentence vpon the King that breaketh, before the people can thinke themſelues freed of their oath. What iuſtice then is it, that the partie ſhall be both iudge and partie, vſurping vpon himſelfe the office of God, may by this argument eaſily appeare: And ſhall it lie in the hands of headleſſe multitude, when they pleaſe to weary off ſubiection, to caſt off the yoake of gouernement that God hath laid vpon them; to iudge and puniſh him, whom-by they ſhould be iudged and puniſhed; and in that caſe, wherein by their violence they kythe themſelues to be moſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate parties, to vſe the office of an vngracious Iudge or Arbiter? Nay, to ſpeake trewly of that caſe, as it ſtands betwixt the king and his people, none of them ought to iudge of the others breake: For conſidering rightly the two parties at the time of their mutuall promiſe, the king is the one party, and the whole people in one body are the other party. And therfore ſince it is certaine, that a king, in caſe ſo it ſhould fal out, that his people in one body had rebelled againſt him, hee ſhould not in that caſe, as thinking himſelfe free of his promiſe and oath; become an vtter enemy, and practiſe the wreake of his whole people and natiue country: although he ought iuſtly to puniſh the principall authours and bellowes of that vniuerſall rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion:
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:23110:126"/>how much leſſe then ought the people (that are alwaies ſubiect vnto him, and naked of all authoritie on their part) preſſe to iudge and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw him? otherwiſe the people, as the one partie contracters, ſhall no ſooner challenge the king as breaker, but hee aſſoone ſhall iudge them as breakers: ſo as the victors making the tyners the traitors (as our prouerbe is) the partie ſhall aye become both iudge and partie in his owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as I haue alreadie ſaid.</p>
               <p>And it is here likewiſe to be noted, that the duty and alleageance, which the people ſweareth to their prince, is not only bound to themſelues, but likewiſe to their lawfull heires and poſterity, the lineall ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of crowns being begun among the people of God, and happily continued in diuers chriſtian common-wealths: So as no obiection either of hereſie, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer priuate ſtatute or law may free the people from their oath-giuing to their king, and his ſucceſſion, eſtabliſhed by the old fundamentall lawes of the kingdome: For, as hee is their heritable ouer-lord, and ſo by birth, not by any right in the coronation, commeth to his crowne, it is a like vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful (the crowne euer ſtanding full) to diſplace him that ſucceedeth thereto, as to eiect the former: For at the very moment of the expiring of the king reigning, the neareſt and lawful heire entreth in his place: And ſo to refuſe him, or intrude another, is not to holde out vncomming in, but to expell and put out their righteous King. And I truſt at this time whole <hi>France</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the ſuperſtitious rebellion of the liguers, who vpon pretence of hereſie, by force of armes held ſo long out, to the great deſolation of their whole countrey, their natiue and righteous king from poſſeſſing of his owne crowne and naturall kingdome.</p>
               <p>Not that by all this former diſcourſe of mine, and Apologie for kings, I meane that whatſoeuer errors and intollerable abominations a ſouereigne prince commit, hee ought to eſcape all puniſhment, as if thereby the world were only ordained for kings, &amp; they without controlment to turne it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down at their pleaſure: but by the contrary, by remitting them to God (who is their onely ordinary Iudge) I remit them to the ſoreit and ſharpeſt ſchoolemaſter that can be deuiſed for them: for the further a king is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God aboue all other ranks &amp; degrees of men, and the higher that his ſeat is aboue theirs, the greater is his obligation to his maker. And therfore in caſe he forget himſelfe (his vnthankfulnes being in the ſame meaſure of height) the ſadder and ſharper will his correction be; and according to the greatnes of the height he is in, the weight of his fall wil reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>penſe the ſame: for the further that any perſon is obliged to God, his offence becomes and growes ſo much the greater, then it would be in any other. <hi>Ioues</hi> thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps light oftner and ſorer vpon the high &amp; ſtately oakes, then on the low and ſupple willow trees: and the higheſt bench is ſliddrieſt to ſit vpon. Neither is it euer heard that any king forgets himſelfe towards God, or in his vocation; but God with the greatneſſe of the plague reuengeth the greatnes of his ingratitude: Neither thinke I by the force and argument
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:23110:127"/>of this my diſcourſe ſo to perſwade the people, that none will hereafter be raiſed vp, and rebell againſt wicked Princes. But remitting to the iuſtice and prouidence of God to ſtirre vp ſuch ſcourges as pleaſeth him, for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of wicked kings (who made the very vermine and filthy duſt of the earth to bridle the inſolencie of proud <hi>Pharaoh</hi>) my onely purpoſe and intention in this treatiſe is to perſwade, as farre as lieth in me, by theſe ſure and infallible grounds, all ſuch good Chriſtian readers, as beare not onely the naked name of a Chriſtian, but kith the fruites thereof in their daily forme of life, to keepe their hearts and hands free from ſuch monſtrous and vnnaturall rebellions, whenſoeuer the wickedneſſe of a Prince ſhall procure the ſame at Gods hands: that, when it ſhall pleaſe God to caſt ſuch ſcourges of princes, and inſtruments of his fury in the fire, ye may ſtand vp with cleane handes, and vnſpotted conſciences, hauing prooued your ſelues in all your actions trew Chriſtians toward God, and dutifull ſubiects towards your King, hauing remitted the iudgement and puniſhment of all his wrongs to him, whom to onely of right it appertaineth.</p>
               <p>But crauing at God, and hoping that God ſhall continue his bleſſing with vs, in not ſending ſuch fearefull deſolation, I heartily wiſh our kings behauiour ſo to be, and continue among vs, as our God in earth, and louing Father, endued with ſuch properties as I deſcribed a King in the firſt part of this Treatiſe. And that ye (my deare countreymen, and charitable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) may preſſe by all meanes to procure the proſperitie and welfare of your King; that as hee muſt on the one part thinke all his earthly felicitie and happineſſe grounded vpon your weale, caring more for himſelfe for your ſake then for his owne, thinking himſelfe onely ordained for your weale; ſuch holy and happy emulation may ariſe betwixt him and you, as his care for your quietnes, and your care for his honour and preſeruation, may in all your actions daily ſtriue together, that the Land may thinke themſelues bleſſed with ſuch a King, and the king may thinke himſelfe moſt happy in ruling ouer ſo louing and obedient ſubiects.</p>

For certainely as ſuch cuſtomes, that haue their firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution either from a godly, neceſſary, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ground, and are firſt brought in, by the meanes of ſome worthy, vertuous, and great Perſonage, are euer, and moſt iuſtly, holden in great and reuerent eſtimation and account, by all wiſe, vertuous, and temperate ſpirits: So ſhould it by the contrary, iuſtly bring a great diſgrace into that ſort of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, which hauing their originall from baſe corruption and barbaritie, doe in like ſort, make their firſt entry into a Countrey, by an inconſiderate and childiſh affectation of Noueltie, as is the trew caſe of the firſt inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Tobacco</hi> taking, and of the firſt entry thereof among vs. For <hi>Tobacco</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a common herbe, which (though vnder diuers names) growes almoſt euery where, was firſt found out by ſome of the barbarous <hi>Indians,</hi> to be a Preſeruatiue or Antidote againſt the Pocks, a filthy diſeaſe, wherunto theſe barbarous people are (as all men know) very much ſubiect, what through the vncleanely and aduſt conſtitution of their bodies, and what through the intemperate heate of their Climate: ſo that as from them was firſt brought into Chriſtendome, that moſt deteſtable diſeaſe; ſo from them likewiſe was brought this vſe of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> as a ſtinking and vnſauourie An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote, for ſo corrupted and execrable a maladie, the ſtinking ſuffumigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof they yet vſe againſt that diſeaſe, making ſo one canker or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nime to eate out another.</p>
               <p>And now good Countrey-men, let vs (I pray you) conſider, what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or policy can mooue vs to imitate the barbarous and beaſtly maners of the wilde, godleſſe, and ſlauiſh <hi>Indians,</hi> eſpecially in ſo vile and ſtinking a cuſtome? Shall we that diſdaine to imitate the maners of our neighbour
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:23110:129"/>
                  <hi>France</hi> (hauing the ſtile of the firſt Chriſtian Kingdome) and that cannot endure the ſpirit of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (their King being now comparable in largeneſſe of Dominions, to the great Emperour of <hi>Turkie</hi>) Shall wee, I ſay, that haue bene ſo long ciuill and wealthy in Peace, famous and inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible in Warre, fortunate in both, we that haue bene euer able to aide any of our neighbours (but neuer deafed any of their eares with any of our ſupplications for aſſiſtance) ſhall wee, I ſay, without bluſhing abaſe our ſelues ſo farre, as to imitate theſe beaſtly <hi>Indians,</hi> ſlaues to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to the world, and as yet aliens from the holy Couenant of God? Why doe we not as well imitate them in walking naked as they doe? in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring glaſſes, feathers, and ſuch toyes, to gold and precious ſtones, as they doe? yea why doe we not denie God and adore the diuel, as they doe?</p>
               <p>Now to the corrupted baſeneſſe of the firſt vſe of this <hi>Tobacco,</hi> doeth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well agree the fooliſh and groundleſſe firſt entry thereof into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. It is not ſo long ſince the firſt entry of this abuſe amongſt vs here, as this preſent aage cannot yet very well remember, both the firſt Authour, and the forme of the firſt introduction of it amongſt vs. It was neither brought in by King, great Conquerour, nor learned doctour of Phiſicke.</p>
               <p>With the report of a great diſcouery for a Conqueſt, ſome two or three Sauage men, were brought in, together with this Sauage cuſtome. But the pitie is, the poore wilde barbarous men died, but that vile barbarous cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is yet aliue, yea in freſh vigor: ſo as it ſeemes a miracle to me, how a cuſtome ſpringing from ſo vile a ground, and brought in by a father ſo generally hated, ſhould be welcomed vpon ſo ſlender a warrant. For if they that firſt put it in practiſe here, had remembred for what reſpect it was vſed by them from whence it came, I am ſure they would haue bene loath, to haue taken ſo farre the imputation of that diſeaſe vpon them as they did, by vſing the cure thereof: For <hi>Sanis non eſt opus medico,</hi> and counterpoiſons are neuer vſed, but where poiſon is thought to precede.</p>
               <p>But ſince it is trew, that diuers cuſtomes ſlightly grounded, and with no better warrant entred in a Common-wealth, may yet in the vſe of them thereafter, prooue both neceſſary and profitable; it is therefore next to bee examined, if there be not a full Sympathie and true Proportion, betweene the baſe ground and fooliſh entrie, and the loathſome and hurtfull vſe of this ſtinking Antidote.</p>
               <p>I am now therefore heartily to pray you to conſider, firſt vpon what falſe and erroneous grounds you haue firſt built the generall good liking thereof; and next, what ſinnes towards God, and fooliſh vanities before the world you commit, in the deteſtable vſe of it.</p>
               <p>As for theſe deceitfull grounds, that haue ſpecially moued you to take a good and great conceit thereof, I ſhall content my ſelfe to examine here onely foure of the principals of them; two founded vpon the Theoricke of a deceiueable apparance of reaſon, and two of them vpon the miſtaken practicke of generall experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:23110:130"/>Firſt, it is thought by you a ſure Aphoriſme in the Phyſickes, That the braines of all men, beeing naturally cold and wet, all drie and hote things ſhould be good for them; of which nature this ſtinking ſuffumigation is, and therefore of good vſe to them. Of this argument, both the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and aſſumption are falſe, and ſo the concluſion cannot but be voyd of it ſelfe. For as to the Propoſition, That becauſe the braines are colde and moiſt, therefore things that are hote and dry are beſt for them, it is an inept conſequence: For man beeing compounded of the foure Complexions, (whoſe fathers are the foure Elements) although there be a mixture of them all in all the parts of his body, yet muſt the diuers parts of our <hi>Microcoſme</hi> or little world within our ſelues, be diuerſly more inclined, ſome to one, ſome to another complexion, according to the diuerſitie of their vſes, that of theſe diſcords a perfect harmonie may be made vp for the maintenance of the whole body.</p>
               <p>The application then of a thing of a contrary nature, to any of theſe parts, is to interrupt them of their due function, and by conſequence hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the health of the whole bodie. As if a man, becauſe the Liuer is hote (as the fountaine of blood) and as it were an ouen to the ſtomacke, would therefore apply and weare cloſe vpon his Liuer and ſtomacke a cake of lead; he might within a very ſhort time (I hope) bee ſuſteined very good cheape at an Ordinarie, beſide the clearing of his conſcience from that deadly ſinne of gluttonie. And as if, becauſe the Heart is full of vitall ſpirits, and in perpetuall motion, a man would therefore lay a heauie pound ſtone on his breaſt, for ſtaying and holding downe that wanton palpitation, I doubt not but his breaſt would be more bruiſed with the weight therof, then the heart would be comforted with ſuch a diſagreeable and contrarious cure. And euen ſo is it with the braines: For if a man, becauſe the braines are cold and humide, would therefore vſe inwardly by ſmells, or outwardly by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, things of hot and dry qualitie, all the gaine that he could make thereof would onely be to put himſelfe in a great forwardnes for running mad, by ouerwatching himſelfe, the coldneſſe and moiſtneſſe of our braine being the onely ordinary meanes that procure our ſleepe and reſt. Indeed I doe not deny, but when it falls out that any of theſe, or any part of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die growes to be diſtempered, and to tend to an extremitie, beyond the compaſſe of Natures temperate mixture, that in that caſe cures of contrary qualities, to the intemperate inclination of that part, being wiſely prepared and diſcreetly miniſtred, may be both neceſſary and helpfull for ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and aſſiſting Nature in the expulſion of her enemies: for this is the trew definition of all profitable Phiſicke.</p>
               <p>But firſt theſe Cures ought not to be vſed, but where there is need of them, the contrary whereof, is daily practiſed in this generall vſe of <hi>Tobacco</hi> by all ſorts and complexions of people.</p>
               <p>And next, I denie the Minor of this argument, as I haue already ſaid, in regard that this <hi>Tobacco,</hi> is not ſimply of a dry and hote qualitie; but rather
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:23110:130"/>hath a certain venemous facultie ioyned with the heat therof, which makes it haue an Antipathy againſt nature, as by the hateful ſmel therof doth well appeare. For the noſe being the proper Organ and conuoy of the ſenſe of ſmelling to the braines, which are the only fountaine of that ſenſe, doth euer ſerue vs for an infallible witneſſe, whether that odour which we ſmell, be healthfull or hurtfull to the braine, (except when it fals out that the ſenſeit ſelfe is corrupted and abuſed through ſome infirmitie, and diſtemper in the braine.) And that the ſuffumigation thereof cannot haue a drying quality, it needs no further probation, then that it is a ſmoke, all ſmoke and vapour, being of it ſelfe humide, as drawing neere to the nature of the aire, and eaſie to be reſolued againe into water, whereof there needs no other proofe but the Meteors, which being bred of nothing elſe but of the vapors and exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations ſucked vp by the Sun out of the earth, the ſea, and waters, yet are the ſame ſmoakie vapors turned and transformed into raines, ſnowes, deawes, hoare froſts, and ſuch like waterie Meteors, as by the contrary the rainie cloudes are often transformed and euaporated in bluſtering windes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Argument grounded on a ſhew of reaſon is, That this filthy ſmoake, aſwell through the heat and ſtrength thereof, as by a naturall force and quality, is able and fit to purge both the head and ſtomack of rhewmes and diſtillations, as experience teacheth, by the ſpitting &amp; auoiding fleame, immediatly after the taking of it. But the fallacie of this Argument may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily appeare, by my late preceding deſcription of the Meteors. For euen as the ſmoakie vapours ſucked vp by the Sunne, and ſtayed in the loweſt and cold Region of the aire, are there contracted into clouds, and turned into raine and ſuch other watery Meteors: So this ſtinking ſmoake being ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp by the noſe, &amp; impriſoned in the cold and moyſt braines, is by their cold and wet facultie, turned and caſt forth againe in waterie diſtillations, and ſo are you made free and purged of nothing, but that wherewith you wilfully burdened your ſelues: and therefore are you no wiſer in taking <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco</hi> for purging you of diſtillations, then if for preuenting the Cholicke you would take all kind of windie meats and drinkes; and for preuenting of the Stone, you would take all kinde of meates and drinkes that would breed grauell in the kidneys, and then when you were forced to auoide much winde out of your ſtomacke, and much grauell in your Vrine, that you ſhould attribute the thanke therof to ſuch nouriſhments, as bred thoſe within you, that behooued either to be expelled by the force of Nature, or you to haue <hi>burſt at the broad ſide,</hi> as the Prouerbe is.</p>
               <p>As for the other two reaſons founded vpon experience, the firſt of which is, That the whole people would not haue taken ſo generall a good liking thereof, if they had not by experience found it very ſoueraigne and good for them: For anſwere thereunto, how eaſily the mindes of any people, wherewith God hath repleniſhed this world may be drawen to the fooliſh affectation of any noueltie, I leaue it to the diſcreet iudgement of any man that is reaſonable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:23110:131"/>Doe we not daily ſee, that a man can no ſooner bring ouer from beyond the ſeas any new forme of apparell, but that he cannot be thought a man of ſpirit, that would not preſently imitate the ſame? And ſo from hand to hand it ſpreads, till it be practiſed by all, not for any commodity that is in it, but only becauſe it is come to be the faſhion. For ſuch is the force of that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſelfe-loue in euery one of vs, and ſuch is the corruption of enuy bred in the breſt of euery one, as we cannot be content vnleſſe wee imitate euery thing that our fellowes doe, and ſo prooue our ſelues capable of euery thing whereof they are capable, like Apes, counterfeiting the maners of others, to our owne deſtruction. For let one or two of the greateſt Maſters of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks in any of the two famous Vniuerſities, but conſtantly affirme any cleare day, that they ſeeſome ſtrange apparition in the skies; they wil I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant you be ſeconded by the greateſt part of the ſtudents in that profeſſion: So loth will they be, to be thought inferior to their fellowes, either in depth of knowledge or ſharpnes of ſight: And therfore the generall good liking and imbracing of this fooliſh cuſtome, doth but only proceed from that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of noueltie, and popular errour, whereof I haue already ſpoken.</p>
               <p>The other argument drawn from a miſtaken experience, is but the more particular probation of this generall, becauſe it is alledged to be found trew by proofe, that by the taking of <hi>Tobacco</hi> diuers and very many doe finde themſelues cured of diuers diſeaſes; as on the other part, no man euer recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued harme thereby. In this argument there is firſt a great miſtaking, and next a monſtrous abſurditie: For is it not a very great miſtaking, to take <hi>non cauſam pro cauſa,</hi> as they ſay in the Logickes? becauſe peraduenture when a ſicke man hath had his diſeaſe at the height, hee hath at that inſtant taken <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and afterward his diſeaſe taking the naturall courſe of declining, and conſequently the Patient of recouering his health, O then the <hi>Tobacco</hi> forſooth, was the worker of that miracle. Beſide that, it is a thing wel known to all Phyſicians, that the apprehenſion and conceit of the patient, hath by wakening and vniting the vitall ſpirits, and ſo ſtrengthening nature, a great power and vertue to cure diuers diſeaſes. For an euident proofe of miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the like caſe, I pray you what fooliſh boy, what ſilly wench, what olde doting wife, or ignorant countrey clowne, is not a Phyſician for the toothach, for the cholicke, and diuers ſuch common diſeaſes? Yea, will not euery man you meet withall, teach you a ſundry curefor the ſame, &amp; ſweare by that meane either himſelfe, or ſome of his neereſt kinſemen and friends was cured? And yet I hope no man is ſo fooliſh as to beleeue them. And all theſe toyes do only proceed fro the miſtaking <hi>Non cauſam pro cauſa,</hi> as I haue already ſaid, and ſo if a man chance to recouer one of any diſeaſe, after hee hath taken <hi>Tobacco,</hi> that muſt haue the thanks of all. But by the contrary, if a man ſmoke himſelfe to death with it (and many haue done) O then ſome other diſeaſe muſt beare the blame for that fault. So doe old harlots thanke their harlotrie for their many yeeres, that cuſtome being healthfull (ſay they) <hi>ad purgandos Renes,</hi> but neuer haue mind how many die of the Pockes
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:23110:131"/>in the flower of their youth. And ſo doe olde drunkards thinke they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long their dayes, by their ſwinelike diet, but neuer remember how many die drowned in drinke before they be halfe olde.</p>
               <p>And what greater abſurditie can therebe, then to ſay that one cure ſhall ſerue for diuers, nay, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarious ſorts of diſeaſes? It is an vndoubted ground among all Phyſicians, that there is almoſt no ſort either of nouriſhment or medicine, that hath not ſome thing in it diſagreeable to ſome part of mans bodie, becauſe as I haue alreadie ſaid, the nature of the temperature of euery part, is ſo different from another, that according to the olde pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, That which is good for the head, is euill for the necke and the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: For euen as a ſtrong enemy, that inuades a town or fortreſſe, although in his ſiege thereof, he do belay and compaſſe it round about, yet he makes his breach and entry, at ſome one or fewe ſpeciall parts thereof, which hee hath tried and found to be weakeſt and leaſt able to reſiſt; ſo ſickenes doth make her particular aſſault, vpon ſuch part or parts of our body, as are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt and eaſieſt to be ouercome by that ſort of diſeaſe, which then doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile vs, although all the reſt of the body by Sympathie feele it ſelfe to be as it were belayed, and beſieged by the affliction of that ſpeciall part, the griefe and ſmart thereof being by the ſenſe of feeling diſperſed through all the reſt of our members. And therefore the skilfull Phyſician preſſes by ſuch cures to purge and ſtrengthen that part which is afflicted, as are only fit for that ſort of diſeaſe, and doe beſt agree with the nature of that infirme part; which being abuſed to a diſeaſe of another nature, would proue as hurtfull for the one, as helpfull for the other. Yea, not onely will a skilfull and wary Phyſician becarefull to vſe no cure but that which is fit for that ſort of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, but he will alſo conſider all other circumſtances, &amp; make the remedies ſutable therunto; as the temperature of the clime where the Patient is, the conſtitution of the Planets, the time of the Moone, the ſeaſon of the yeere, the aage and complexion of the Patient, and the preſent ſtate of his body, in ſtrength or weaknes: For one cure muſt not euer be vſed for the ſelfeſame diſeaſe, but according to the varying of any of the foreſaid circumſtances, that ſort of remedy muſt be vſed which is fitteſt for the ſame. Where by the contrary in this caſe, ſuch is the miraculous omnipotencie of our ſtrong ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted <hi>Tobacco,</hi> as it cures al ſorts of diſeaſes (which neuer any drugge could do before) in all perſons, and at all times. It cures all maner of diſtillations, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the head or ſtomacke (if you beleeue their Axiomes) although in very deed it doe both corrupt the braine, and by cauſing ouer quicke dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, fill the ſtomacke full of crudities. It cures the gowt in the feet, and (which is miraculous) in that very inſtant when the ſmoke thereof, as light, flies vp into the head, the vertue therof, as heauy, runs down to the litle toe. It helps all ſorts of agues. It makes a man ſober that was drunk. It refreſhes a weary man, and yet makes a man hungry. Being taken when they goe to bed, it makes one ſleepe ſoundly, and yet being taken when a man is ſleepie and drowſie, it will, as they ſay, awake his braine, and quicken his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:23110:132"/>As for curing of the Pockes, it ſerues for that vſe but among the pockie Indian ſlaues. Here in <hi>England</hi> it is refined, and will not deigne to cure here any other then cleanly and gentlemanly diſeaſes. O omnipotent power of <hi>Tobacco!</hi> And if it could by the ſmoake thereof chaſe out deuils, as the ſmoake of <hi>Tobias</hi> fiſh did (which I am ſure could ſmell no ſtronglier) it would ſerue for a precious Relicke, both for the ſuperſtitious Prieſts, and the inſolent Puritanes, to caſt out deuils withall.</p>
               <p>Admitting then, and not confeſſing, that the vſe thereof were healthful for ſome ſorts of diſeaſes; ſhould it be vſed for all ſickneſſes? ſhould it be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by all men? ſhould it be vſed at all times? yea ſhould it be vſed by able, yong, ſtrong, healthful men? Medicine hath that vertue, that it neuer leaues a man in that ſtate wherein it finds him: it makes a ſicke man whole, but a whole man ſicke: And as Medicine helps nature being taken at times of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, ſo being euer and continually vſed, it doeth but weaken, weary, and weare nature. What ſpeake I of Medicine? Nay let a man euery houre of the day, or as oft as many in this countrey vſe to take <hi>Tobacco,</hi> let a man I ſay, but take as oft the beſt ſorts of nouriſhments in meate and drinke that can be deuiſed, he ſhall with the continuall vſe thereof weaken both his head and his ſtomacke: all his members ſhall becomefeeble, his ſpirits dull, and in the end, as a drowſie lazie belly-god, he ſhall euaniſh in a Lethargie.</p>
               <p>And from this weakeneſſe it proceeds, that many in this kingdome haue had ſuch a continuall vſe of taking this vnſauorie ſmoake, as now they are not able to forbeare the ſame, no more then an old drunkard can abide to be long ſober, without falling into an incurable weakneſſe and euill conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for their continuall cuſtome hath made to them, <hi>habitum, alteram na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam:</hi> ſo to thoſe that from their birth haue beene continually nouriſhed vpon poiſon and things venemous, wholſome meats are only poiſonable.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing, as I truſt, ſufficiently anſwered the moſt principall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are vſed in defence of this vile cuſtome, it reſts only to informe you what ſinnes and vanities you commit in the filthy abuſe thereof. Firſt, are you not guiltie of ſinnefull and ſhamefull luſt? (for luſt may be as well in any of the ſenſes as in feeling) that although you be troubled with no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, but in perfect health, yet can you neither be merry at an Ordinary, nor laſciuious in the Stewes, if you lacke <hi>Tobacco</hi> to prouoke your appetite to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe ſorts of recreation, luſting after it as the children of Iſrael did in the wilderneſſe after Quailes? Secondly it is, as you vſe or rather abuſe it, a branch of the ſinne of drunkennes, which is the root of all ſinnes: for as the only delight that drunkards take in wine is in the ſtrength of the taſte, and the force of the fume therof that mounts vp to the braine: for no drunkards loue any weake, or ſweet drinke: ſo are not thoſe (I meane the ſtrong heate and the fume) the onely qualities that make <hi>Tobacco</hi> ſo delectable to all the louers of it? And as no man likes ſtrong heady drinke the firſt day (becauſe <hi>nemo repentè fit turpiſsimus</hi>) but by cuſtome is piece and piece allured, while in the ende, a drunkard will haue as great a thirſt to be drunke, as a ſober
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:23110:132"/>man to quench his thirſt with a draught when he hath need of it: So is not this the very caſe of all the great takers of <hi>Tobacco?</hi> which therefore they themſelues doe attribute to a bewitching qualitie in it. Thirdly, is it not the greateſt ſinne of all, that you the people of all ſorts of this kingdome, who are created and ordeined by God, to beſtow both your perſons and goods, for the maintenance both of the honour and ſafety of your King and Common wealth, ſhould diſable your ſelues in both? In your perſons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by this continuall vile cuſtome brought your ſelues to this ſhamefull imbecilitie, that you are not able to ride or walke the iourney of a Iewes Sabboth, but you muſt haue a reekie cole brought you from the next poore houſe to kindle your <hi>Tobacco</hi> with? whereas he cannot be thought able for any ſeruice in the warres, that cannot endure oftentimes the want of meat, drinke, and ſleepe, much more then muſt he endure the want of <hi>Tobacco.</hi> In the times of the many glorious and victorious battailes fought by this Nation, there was no word of <hi>Tobacco:</hi> but now if it were time of warres, and that you were to make ſome ſudden <hi>Caualcado</hi> vpon your enemies, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you ſhould ſeeke leiſure to ſtay behinde his fellow for taking of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,</hi> for my part I ſhould neuer be ſory for any euill chance that might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall him. To take a cuſtome in any thing that cannot be left againe, is moſt harmeful to the people of any land. <hi>Mollicies</hi> and delicacie were the wracke and ouerthrow, firſt of the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and next of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire. And this very cuſtome of taking <hi>Tobacco</hi> (whereof our preſent purpoſe is) is euen at this day accounted ſo effeminate among the <hi>Indians</hi> themſelues, as in the market they will offer no price for a ſlaue to be ſold, whom they find to be a great <hi>Tobacco</hi> taker.</p>
               <p>Now how you are by this cuſtome diſabled in your goods, let the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of this land beare witneſſe, ſome of them beſtowing three, ſome foure hundred pounds a yeere vpon this precious ſtinke, which I am ſure might be beſtowed vpon many farre better vſes. I read indeed of a knauiſh Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, who for abuſing the fauour of the Emperor <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, by taking bribes to intercede, for ſundry perſons in his maſters eare, (for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he neuer once opened his mouth) was iuſtly choked with ſmoke, with this doome, <hi>Fumo pereat, qui fumum vendidit:</hi> but of ſo many ſmoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buyers, as are at this preſent in this kingdome, I neuer read nor heard.</p>
               <p>And for the vanities committed in this filthy cuſtome, is it not both great vanitie and vncleanneſſe, that at the table, a place of reſpect, of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, of modeſtie, men ſhould not be aſhamed, to ſit toſſing of <hi>Tobacco pipes,</hi> and puffing of the ſmoke of <hi>Tobacco</hi> one to another, making the filthy ſmoke and ſtinke thereof, to exhale athwart the diſhes, and infect the aire, when very often, men that abhorre it are at their repaſt? Surely ſmoke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a kitchin farre better then a dining chamber, and yet it makes a kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin alſo oftentimes in the inward parts of men, ſoyling and infecting them, with an vnctuous and oily kind of ſoote, as hath bene found in ſome great <hi>Tobacco</hi> takers, that after their death were opened. And not onely
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:23110:133"/>meat time, but no other time nor action is exempted from the publike vſe of this vnciuill tricke: ſo as if the wiues of <hi>Diepe</hi> liſt to conteſt with this Nation for good maners, their worſt maners would in all reaſon be found at leaſt not ſo diſhoneſt (as ours are) in this point. The publike vſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, at all times, and in all places, hath now ſo farre preuailed, as diuers men very ſound both in iudgement and complexion, haue beene at laſt forced to take it alſo without deſire, partly becauſe they were aſhamed to ſeeme ſingular, (like the two Philoſophers that were forced to ducke themſelues in that raine water, and ſo become fooles as well as the reſt of the people) and partly to be as one that was content to eate Garlick (which he did not loue) that he might not be troubled with the ſmell of it, in the breath of his fellowes. And is it not a great vanitie, that a man cannot heartily welcome his friend now, but ſtraight they muſt be in hand with <hi>Tobacco:</hi> No it is become in place of a eure, a point of good fellowſhip, and hee that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to take a pipe of <hi>Tobacco</hi> among his fellowes, (though by his owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection hee would rather feele the ſauour of a Sinke) is accounted peeuiſh and no good company, euen as they doe with tipling in the colde Eaſterne countreys. Yea the Miſtreſſe cannot in a more manerly kind, entertaine her ſeruant, then by giuing him out of her faire hand a pipe of <hi>Tobacco.</hi> But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is not only a great vanity, but a great contempt of Gods good giftes, that the ſweetneſſe of mans breath, being a good gift of God, ſhould be wilfully corrupted by this ſtinking ſmoke, wherin I muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, it hath too ſtrong a vertue; and ſo that which is an ornament of nature, &amp; can neither by any artifice be at the firſt acquired, nor once loſt be recouered againe, ſhalbe fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily corrupted with an incurable ſtinke, which vile qualitie is as directly contrary to that wrong opinion which is holden of the wholeſomneſſe therof, as the venime of putrifaction is contrary to the vertue Preſeruatiue.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, which is a great iniquitie, and againſt all humanitie, the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhal not be aſhamed, to reduce therby his delicate, wholſom, &amp; cleane complexioned wife to that extremity, that either ſhe muſt alſo corrupt her ſweet breath therwith, or els reſolue to liue in a perpetual ſtinking torment.</p>
               <p>Haue you not reaſon then to be aſhamed, and to forbeare this filthie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueltie, ſo baſely grounded, ſo fooliſhly receiued, and ſo groſſely miſtaken in the right vſe thereof? In your abuſe thereof ſinning againſt God, harming your ſelues both in perſons and goods, and raking alſo thereby the markes and notes of vanitie vpon you; by the cuſtome thereof making your ſelues to be wondered at by all forreine ciuill Nations, and by all ſtrangers that come among you, to be ſcorned and contemned: A cuſtome loathſome to the eye, hatefull to the noſe, harmefull to the braine, dangerous to the lungs, and in the blacke ſtinking fume thereof, neereſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the horrible Stigian ſmoake of the pit that is bottomleſſe.</p>

               </note> being in his owne lodging ready to goe to ſupper at ſuen of the clocke at night, one of his foot-men (whom he had ſent of an errand ouer the ſtreet) was met by an vnknowen man of a reaſonable tall perſonage, who deliuered him a Letter, charging him to put it in my Lord his maſters hands: which my Lord no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, but that hauing broken it vp, and perceiuing the ſame to bee of an vnknowen and ſomewhat vnlegible hand, and without either date or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; did call one of his men vnto him for helping him to reade it. But no ſooner did he conceiue the ſtrange contents thereof, although hee was ſomewhat perplexed what conſtruction to make of it (as whether of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of conſequence, as indeed it was, or whether ſome fooliſh deuiſed Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil by ſome of his enemies, to skarre him from his attendance at the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) yet did he as a moſt dutifull and loyall Subiect, conclude not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it, what euer might come of it.

               </note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they two in preſence of the Lord <hi>Mountegle,</hi> calling to mind the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer intelligence already mentioned, which ſeemed to haue ſome relation with this Letter; The tender care which they euer caried to the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Maieſties perſon, made them apprehend, that ſome perillous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt did thereby appeare to be intended againſt the ſame, which did the more neerly concerne the ſaid L. <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> to haue a care of, in regard that it doth belong to the charge of his Office to ouerſee as well all places of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly where his Maieſty is to repaire, as his Highneſſe owne priuate hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And therfore did the ſaid two Counſailors conclude, That they ſhould ioyne vnto themſelues three more of the Councell, to wit, the Lord <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Worcester</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> to be alſo particularly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this accident, who hauing all of them concurred together to the re-examination of the Contents of the ſaid Letter, they did conclude, That how ſlight a matter it might at the firſt appeare to bee, yet was it not abſolutely to be contemned, in reſpect of the care which it behooued them to haue of the preſeruation of his Maieſties perſon: But yet reſolued for two reaſons,
<note place="margin">Thought meet by the Councellors to acquaint the King with the Letter.</note> firſt to acquaint the King himſelfe with the ſame before they proceeded to any further inquiſition in the matter, aſwell for the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and experience they had of his Maieſties fortunate Iudgement in clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ſoluing of obſcure riddles and doubtful myſteries; as alſo becauſe the more time would in the meane while be giuen for the Practiſe to ripen,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:23110:135"/>if any was, whereby the Diſcouery might be the more cleere and euident, and the ground of proceeding thereupon more ſafe, iuſt, and eaſie. And ſo according to their determination did the ſayd Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi> repaire to the King in his Gallery vpon Friday, being <hi>Athallow</hi> day, in the afternoone,
<note place="margin">Vpon Alhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low day the Earle of <hi>Saſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie</hi> ſhewed the Letter to the King.</note> which was the day after his Maieſties arriuall, and none but himſelfe being preſent with his Highneſſe at that time, where without any other ſpeach or iudgement giuing of the Letter, but onely relating ſimply the forme of the deliuery thereof, he preſented it to his Maieſtie. The contents whereof follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MY Lord, Out of the loue I beare to ſome of your friends, I haue a care of your preſeruation. Therefore I would aduiſe you, as you tender your life, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe ſome excuſe to ſhift off your attendance at this Parliament. For God and man haue concurred to puniſh the wickedneſſe of this Time. And thinke not ſlightly of this Aduertiſement, but retire your ſelfe into your Countrey, where you may expect the euent in ſafety. For though there be no apparance of any ſtirre, yet I ſay, they ſhal receiue a terrible Blow this Parliament, and yet they ſhall not ſee who burts them. This counſell is not to be contemned, becauſe it may doe you good, and can doe you no harme; for the danger is past ſo ſoone as you haue burnt the Letter. And I hope God will giue you the grace to make good vſe of it: To whoſe holy protection I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King no ſooner read the Letter, but after a little pauſe,
<note place="margin">His Maieſties iudgement of the Letter.</note> and then reading it ouer againe, he deliuered his iudgement of it in ſuch ſort, as hee thought it was not to be contemned, for that the Style of it ſeemed to bee more quicke and pithie, then is vſuall to be in any Paſquil or libel (the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities of idle braines:) But the Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi> perceiuing the King to apprehend it deepelier then he looked for, knowing his nature, told him that he thought by one ſentence in it, that it was like to be written by ſome foole or madman, reading to him this ſentence in it, <hi>For the danger is past as ſoone as you haue burnt the Letter;</hi> which hee ſaid, was likely to bee the ſaying of a foole: for if the danger was paſt ſo ſoone as the Letter was burnt, then the warning behooued to bee of little auayle, when the burning of the Letter might make the danger to be eſchewed. But the King by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſidering the former ſentence in the Letter, <hi>That they ſhould receiue a terrible Blow at this Parliament, and yet ſhould not ſee who hurt them,</hi> Ioyning it to the ſentence immediatly following, already alledged, did therupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, That the danger mentioned, ſhould bee ſome ſuddaine danger by blowing vp of Powder: For no other Inſurrection, Rebellion, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer other priuate and deſperate Attempt could bee committed or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in time of Parliament, and the Authours thereof vnſeene, except onely it were by a blowing vp of Powder, which might bee performed by one baſe knaue in a darke corner; whereupon he was moued to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete and conſtrue the latter Sentence in the Letter (alledged by the Earle of <hi>Salisburie</hi>) againſt all ordinarie ſence and conſtruction in Grammar,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:23110:136"/>as if by theſe words, <hi>For the danger is past as ſoone as you haue burned the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſhould be cloſely vnderſtood the ſuddaintie and quickeneſſe of the danger, which ſhould be as quickly perfourmed and at an end, as that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſhould be of bleaſing vp in the fire; turning that word of <hi>as ſoone,</hi> to the ſenſe of, <hi>as quickly:</hi> And therefore wiſhed, that before his going to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<note place="margin">His Maieſties opinion for ſearching of the vnder roume: of the Parliament Houſe.</note> the vnder roumes of the Parliament houſe might be well and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly ſearched. But the Earle of <hi>Salisbury</hi> wondering at this his Maieſties Commentary, which he knew to be ſo farre contrary to his ordinary and naturall diſpoſition, who did rather euer ſinne vpon the other ſide; in not apprehending nor truſting due Aduertiſements of Practiſes and Perils when hee was trewly enformed of them, whereby hee had many times drawen himſelfe into many deſperate dangers: and interpreting rightly this extraordinary Caution at this time to proceede from the vigilant care hee had of the whole State, more then of his owne Perſon, which could not but haue all periſhed together, if this deſignement had ſucceeded: Hee thought good to diſſemble ſtill vnto the King, that there had beene any iuſt cauſe of ſuch apprehenſion: And ending the purpoſe with ſome mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ieaſt vpon this Subiect, as his cuſtome is, tooke his leaue for that time.</p>
            <p>But though he ſeemed ſo to neglect it to his Maieſtie; yet his cuſtomable and watchfull care of the King and the State ſtill boyling within him, And hauing with the bleſſed Virgine <hi>Marie</hi> laid vp in his heart the Kings ſo ſtrange iudgement and conſtruction of it; He could not be at reſt til he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the foreſaid Lords what had paſſed betweene the King and him in priuat: Wherupon they were all ſo earneſt to renew againe the memory of the ſame purpoſe to his Maieſtie, as it was agreed that he ſhould the next day, being Saturday, repaire to his Highneſſe: which hee did in the ſame priuie Gallery, and renewed the memory thereof, the L. <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> then being preſent with the King.
<note place="margin">The determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ſearch the Parliament houſe and the roumes vnder it.</note> At what time it was determined, that the ſaid Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> ſhould, according to his cuſtome and Office, view all the Parliament Houſes, both aboue and below, and conſider what likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood or appearance of any ſuch danger might poſſibly be gathered by the ſight of them: But yet, as well for ſtaying of idle rumours, as for beeing the more able to diſcerne any myſterie, the nearer that things were in readineſſe, his iourney thither was ordeined to bee deferred till the afternoone before the ſitting downe of the Parliament, which was vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Munday following. At what time hee (according to this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) went to the Parliament houſe accompanied with my Lord <hi>Mountegle,</hi> beeing in zeale to the Kings ſeruice earneſt and curious to ſee the euent of that accident whereof hee had the fortune to be the firſt diſcouerer: where, hauing viewed all the lower roumes,
<note place="margin">Wood and Coale found by the Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> in the Vault.</note> hee found in the Vault vnder the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Houſe great ſtore and prouiſion of Billets, Faggots, and Coales: And enquiring of <hi>Whyneard</hi> Keeper of the Wardrobe, to what vſe hee had put thoſe lower roumes and cellars: he told him, That <hi>Thomas Percie</hi> had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:23110:136"/>both the Houſe, and part of the Cellar or Vault vnder the ſame, and that the Wood and Coale therein was the ſaid Gentlemansowne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion: Whereupon the Lord <hi>Chamberlaine,</hi> caſting his eye aſide, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a fellow ſtanding in a corner there, calling himſelf the ſaid <hi>Percies</hi> man, and keeper of that houſe for him, but indeed was <hi>Guido Fawkes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Guido Fawkes</hi> bearing the name of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> man.</note> the owner of that hand which ſhould haue acted that monſtrous Tragedie.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> looking vpon all things with a heedfull indeed, yet in outward appearance with but a careleſſe and rackleſſe eye (as became ſo wiſe and diligent a miniſter) hee preſently addreſſed himſelfe to the King in the ſaid priuie Gallery, wherein the preſence of the Lord <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> the Lord <hi>Admirall,</hi> the Earles of <hi>Worcester, Northampton,</hi> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Chamberlaines</hi> report and iudgement of what he had obſerued in the ſearch.</note> hee made his report, what hee had ſeene and obſerued there; noting that <hi>Mountegle</hi> had told him, That he no ſooner heard <hi>Thomas Percy</hi> named to be the poſſeſſour of that houſe, but conſidering both his backwardnes in Religion, and the old deareneſſe in friendſhip betweene himſelfe and the ſaid <hi>Percy,</hi> hee did greatly ſuſpect the matter, and that the Letter ſhould come from him. The ſaid Lord <hi>Chamberlaine</hi> alſo tolde, That he did not wonder a little at the extraordinary great prouiſion of wood and coale in that houſe, where <hi>Thomas Percie</hi> had ſo ſeldome occaſion to remaine; As likewiſe it gaue him in his minde that his man looked like a very tall and deſperate fellow.</p>
            <p>This could not but encreaſe the Kings former apprehenſion and iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie: whereupon hee inſiſted (as before) that the Houſe was narrowly to bee ſearched, and that thoſe Billets and Coales would be ſearched to the bottome, it beeing moſt ſuſpicious that they were layed there onely for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering of the powder. Of this ſame minde alſo were all the Counſailours then preſent:
<note place="margin">Diſputation about the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſearch.</note> But vpon the faſhion of making of the ſearch was it long debated: For vpon the one ſide they were all ſo iealous of the Kings ſafety, that they all agreed, that there could not be too much caution vſed for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting his danger. And yet vpon the other part they were all extreme loath and daintie, that in caſe this Letter ſhould proue to bee nothing but the euaporation of an idle braine; then a curious ſearch beeing made, and nothing found, ſhould not onely turne to the generall ſcandall of the King and the State, as being ſo ſuſpicious of euery light and friuolous toy, but likewiſe lay an ill fauoured imputation vpon the Earle of <hi>Northumberland</hi> one of his Maieſties greateſt Subiects and Counſailors, this <hi>Tho. Percie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his kinſman, and moſt confident familiar. And the rather were they cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vpon this point, knowing how far the King deteſted to be thought ſuſpitious or iealous of any of his good Subiects, though of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt degree. And therefore though they all agreed vpon the maine ground, which was to prouide for the ſecuritie of the Kings Perſon, yet did they much differ in the circumſtances, by which this action might be beſt caried with leaſt dinne and occaſion of ſlaunder. But the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſtill perſiſting that there were diuers ſhrewd appearances, and that
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:23110:137"/>a narrow ſearch of thoſe places could preiudge no man that was innocent, hee at laſt plainely reſolued them, That either muſt all the partes of thoſe roumes bee narrowly ſearched, and no poſſibilitie of danger left vnexami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or elſe hee and they all muſt reſolue not to meddle in it at all, but plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to goe the next day to the Parliament, and leaue the ſucceſſe to Fortune, which he beleeued they would be loth to take vpon their conſciences: for in ſuch a caſe as this,
<note place="margin">Agreed that the ſearch ſhould be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of ſeeking for Wardrobe ſtuffe miſſed by <hi>Whynniard.</hi>
               </note> an halfe doing was worſe then no doing at all. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was at laſt concluded, That nothing ſhould bee left vnſearched in thoſe Houſes: And yet for the better colour and ſtay of rumour, in caſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were found, it was thought meet, that vpon a pretence of <hi>Whyneards</hi> miſſing ſome of the Kings ſtuffe or Hangings which he had in keeping, all thoſe roumes ſhould be narrowly ripped for them. And to this purpoſe was Sir <hi>Thomas Kneuet</hi> (a Gentleman of his Maieſties priuie Chamber) em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, being a Iuſtice of Peace in <hi>Westminster,</hi> and one, of whoſe ancient fidelitie both the late Queene and our now Soueraigne haue had large proofe: who according to the truſt committed vnto him, went about the midnight next after, to the Parliament-houſe, accompanied with ſuch a ſmall number as was fit for that errand. But before his entry in the houſe,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fawkes</hi> found at midnight without the houſe.</note> finding <hi>Thomas Percies</hi> alleaged man ſtanding without the doores, his cloathes and bootes on at ſo dead a time of the night, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to apprehend him, as hee did, and thereafter went forward to the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the houſe, where after he had cauſed to be ouerturned ſome of the Billets and Coales, he firſt found one of the ſmall Barrels of Powder, and after all the reſt, to the number of thirty ſixe Barrels, great and ſmall: And thereafter ſearching the fellow, whom he had taken, found three matches, and all other inſtruments fit for blowing vp the Powder, readie vpon him, which made him inſtantly confeſſe his owne guiltineſſe, declaring alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, That if hee had happened to be within the houſe when hee tooke him, as he was immediatly before (at the ending of his worke) hee would not haue failed to haue blowen him vp, houſe and all.</p>
            <p>Thus after Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> had cauſed the wretch to bee ſurely bound, and well guarded by the company hee had brought with him, hee himſelfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned backe to the Kings Palace, and gaue warning of his ſucceſſe to the Lord Chamberlaine, and Earle of Salisburie, who immediatly warning the reſt of the Councell that lay in the houſe, as ſoone as they could get themſelues ready, came, with their fellow Counſellers, to the Kings Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, being at that time neere foure of the clocke in the morning. And at the firſt entry of the Kings Chamber doore,
<note place="margin">Vpon Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Kneuets</hi> returne the Councel war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> the Lord Chamberlaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not any longer able to conceale his ioy for the preuenting of ſo great a danger, told the King in a confuſed haſte, that all was found and diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the Traitor in hands and faſt bound.</p>
            <p>Then, order beeing firſt taken for ſending for the reſt of the Councell that lay in the Towne, The priſoner himſelfe was brought into the houſe, where in reſpect of the ſtrangenes of the accident, no man was ſtayed from
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:23110:137"/>the ſight or ſpeaking with him. And within a while after, the Council did examine him; Who ſeeming to put on a <hi>Romane</hi> reſolution, did both to the Councill, and to euery other perſon that ſpake with him that day, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare ſo conſtant and ſetled vpon his grounds, as wee all thought wee had found ſome new <hi>Mutius Scaeuola</hi> borne in England. For notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the horrour of the fact, the guilt of his conſcience, his ſudden ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the terrour which ſhould haue bene ſtroken in him by comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the preſence of ſo graue a Councill, and the reſtleſſe and confuſed que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions that euery man all that day did vexe him with; Yet was his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſo farre from being deiected, as he often ſmiled in ſcornefull maner, not onely auowing the Fact, but repenting onely, with the ſaid <hi>Scaeuola,</hi> his failing in the execution thereof, whereof (he ſaid) the diuel and not God, was the diſcouerer: Anſwering quickly to euery mans obiection, ſcoffing at any idle queſtions which were propounded vnto him, and ieſting with ſuch as he thought had no authoritie to examine him. All that day could the Councill get nothing out of him touching his Complices, refuſing to anſwere to any ſuch queſtions which hee thought might diſcouer the plot, and laying all the blame vpon himſelfe; Whereunto he ſaid hee was mooued onely for Religion and conſcience ſake, denying the King to be his lawfull Soueraigne, or the Anoynted of God, in reſpect he was an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, and giuing himſelfe no other name then <hi>Iohn Iohnſon,</hi> ſeruant to <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Percie.</hi> But the next morning being caried to the Tower, hee did not there remaine aboue two or three dayes, being twiſe or thriſe in that ſpace reexamined, and the Racke onely offered and ſhewed vnto him, when the maske of his Romane fortitude did viſibly beginne to weare and ſlide off his face; And then did hee beginne to confeſſe part of the trewth, and thereafter to open the whole matter, as doeth appeare by his depoſitions immediatly following.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot out of hope to obtaine pardon: for, ſpeaking of my temporall part, I may ſay, The fault is greater then can bee forgiuen; nor affecting hereby the title of a good Subiect; for I muſt redeeme my countrey from as great a danger, as I haue hazarded the bringing of her into, before I can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe any ſuch opinion, Onely at your Honours command I will briefly ſet downe mine owne accuſation, and how farre I haue proceeded in this buſineſſe; which I ſhall the faithfullier doe, ſince I ſee ſuch courſes are not pleaſing to Almightie God, and that all, or the moſt materiall parts haue bene already confeſſed.</p>
                        <p>I remained with my brother in the countrey, from Alhallontyde vntill the beginning of Lent, in the yeere of our Lord 1603. the firſt yeere of the Kings reigne: about which time maſter <hi>Catesby</hi> ſent thither, intreating me to come to London, where hee and other my friends would be glad to ſee me. I deſired him to excuſe me: for I found my ſelfe not very well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and (which had happened neuer to mee before) returned the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger without my company. Shortly I receiued another letter, in any wiſe to come. At the ſecond ſummons I preſently came vp, and found him with maſter <hi>Iohn Wright</hi> at Lambeth, where he brake with me, how neceſſary it was not to forſake our countrey (for he knew I had then a reſolution to goe ouer) but to deliuer her from the ſeruitude in which ſhee remained, or at leaſt to aſſiſt her with our vttermoſt endeuours. I anſwered, That I had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hazarded my life vpon farre lighter termes, and now would not refuſe any good occaſion, wherein I might doe ſeruice to the Catholicke cauſe; but for my ſelfe I knew no meane probable to ſucceed. He ſaid that he had bethought him of a way at one inſtant to deliuer vs from all our bonds, and without any forraine helpe to replant againe the Catholicke Religion; and with all told mee in a word, It was to blow vp the Parliament houſe with Gunpowder; for, ſaid he, in that place haue they done vs all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, and perchance God hath deſſeigned that place for their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I wondered at the ſtrangeneſſe of the conceipt, and told him that trew it was, this ſtrake at the root, and would breed a confuſion fit to beget new alterations; But if it ſhould not take effect (as moſt of this nature miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caried)
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:23110:139"/>the ſcandall would be ſo great which Catholicke Religion might hereby ſuſtaine, as not onely our enemies, but our friends alſo would with good reaſon condemne vs. He told me, The nature of the diſeaſe required ſo ſharpe a remedie, and asked me if I would giue my conſent. I told him, yes, in this or what els ſoeuer; if he reſolued vpon it, I would venture my life. But I propoſed many difficulties, As want of an houſe, and of one to cary the Myne, noyſe in the working, and ſuch like. His anſwere was, Let vs giue an attempt, and where it faileth, paſſe no further. But firſt, quoth hee, Becauſe wee will leaue no peaceable and quiet way vntryed, you ſhall goe ouer, and informe the Conſtable of the ſtate of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes here in England, intreating him to ſollicite his Maieſtie at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming hither, that the penall Lawes may be recalled, and wee admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the rancke of his other Subiects; withall, you may bring ouer ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Gentleman, ſuch as you ſhall vnderſtand beſt able for this buſineſſe, and named vnto mee maſter <hi>Fawkes.</hi> Shortly after, I paſſed the Sea, and found the Conſtable at <hi>Bergen</hi> neere <hi>Dunkirke,</hi> where, by helpe of maſter <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen</hi> I deliuered my meſſage; Whoſe anſwere was, that hee had ſtrict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from his Maſter, to doe all good Offices for the Catholickes, and for his owne part hee thought himſelfe bound in conſcience ſo to doe, and that no good occaſion ſhould be omitted, but ſpake to him nothing of this matter.</p>
                        <p>Returning to <hi>Dunkirck</hi> with maſter <hi>Owen,</hi> wee had ſpeach whether hee thought the Conſtable would faithfully helpe vs, or no. He ſaid he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued nothing leſſe, and that they ſought onely their owne ends, holding ſmall account of Catholicks. I told him that there were many Gentlemen in <hi>England,</hi> who would not forſake their countrey vntill they had tried the vttermoſt, &amp; rather venture their liues, then forſake her in this miſerie. And to adde one more to our number, as a fit man both for counſel and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of whatſoeuer we ſhould reſolue, wiſhed for maſter <hi>Fawkes,</hi> whom I had heard good commendations of: hee told mee the Gentleman deſerued no leſſe, but was at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and that if he came not, as happily he might, before my departure, he would ſend him ſhortly after into <hi>England.</hi> I went ſoone after to <hi>Oſtend,</hi> where ſir <hi>William Stanley</hi> as then was not, but came two daies after. I remained with him three or foure daies, in which time I asked him, if the Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> ſhould do any thing to helpe themſelues, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he thought the Archduke would ſecond them? He anſwered, No, for all thoſe parts were ſo deſirous of peace with <hi>England,</hi> as they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure no ſpeach of other enterpriſe: neither were it fit, ſaid hee, to ſet any proiect afoot, now the Peace is vpon concluding. I told him there was no ſuch reſolution, and ſo fell to diſcourſe of other matters, vntill I came to ſpeake of maſter <hi>Fawkes,</hi> whoſe company I wiſhed ouer into <hi>England.</hi> I asked of his ſufficiencie in the warres, and told him wee ſhould need ſuch as hee, if occaſion required; hee gaue very good commendations of him. And as wee were thus diſcourſing, and I ready to depart for <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi>
                           <pb n="236" facs="tcp:23110:140"/>and taking my leaue of Sir <hi>William,</hi> Maſter <hi>Fawkes</hi> came into our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, newly returned, and ſaluted vs. This is the Gentleman, ſaid Sir <hi>William,</hi> that you wiſhed for, and ſo we embraced againe. I told him ſome good friends of his wiſhed his companie in <hi>England,</hi> and that if hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to come to <hi>Dunkircke,</hi> wee would haue further conference, whither I was then going: ſo taking my leaue of them both, I departed. About two dayes after came Maſter <hi>Fawkes</hi> to <hi>Dunkirck,</hi> where I told him that we were vpon a reſolution to doe ſomewhat in <hi>England,</hi> if the Peace with <hi>Spaine</hi> helped vs not, but had as yet reſolued vpon nothing; ſuch or the like talke wee paſſed at <hi>Graueling,</hi> where I lay for a winde, and when it ſerued came both in one Paſſage to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> neere which place wee tooke a paire of Oares, and ſo came vp to <hi>London,</hi> and came to Maſter <hi>Catesby</hi> whom wee found in his lodging; hee welcommed vs into <hi>England,</hi> and asked mee what newes from the Conſtable. I told him, good words, but I feared the deedes would not anſwere: This was the beginning of Eaſter Terme, and about the middeſt of the ſame Terme, (whether ſent for by Maſter <hi>Catesby,</hi> or vpon ſome buſineſſe of his owne) vp came Maſter <hi>Thomas Percy.</hi> The firſt word hee ſpake (after hee came into our company) was, Shall we alwayes (Gentlemen) talke, and neuer doe any thing? Maſter <hi>Catesby</hi> took him aſide, and had ſpeach about ſomewhat to be done, ſo as firſt we might all take an oath of ſecrecie, which wee reſolued within two or three dayes to doe: ſo as there we met behind <hi>S. Clements,</hi> Maſter <hi>Catesby,</hi> Maſter <hi>Percy,</hi> Maſter <hi>Wright,</hi> Maſter <hi>Guy Fawkes,</hi> and my ſelfe; and hauing vpon a Primer giuen each other the oath of ſecrecie, in a chamber where no other bodie was, wee went after into the next roome and heard Maſſe, and receiued the bleſſed Sacrament vpon the ſame. Then did Maſter <hi>Catesby</hi> diſcloſe to Maſter <hi>Percy,</hi> and I together with <hi>Iacke Wright,</hi> tell to Maſter <hi>Fawkes</hi> the buſineſſe for which wee tooke this oath, which they both approued. And then was M. <hi>Percy</hi> ſent to take the houſe, which M. <hi>Catesby</hi> in mine ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, had learned did belong to one <hi>Ferris,</hi> which with ſome difficultie in the end he obtained, and became, as <hi>Ferris</hi> before was, Tenant to <hi>Whynniard.</hi> M. <hi>Fawkes</hi> vnderwent the name of M. <hi>Percies</hi> man, calling himſelfe <hi>Iohnſon,</hi> becauſe his face was the moſt vnknowen, and receiued the keyes of the houſe, vntill wee heard that the Parliament was adiourned to the ſeuenth of Februarie: At which time we all departed ſeuerall wayes into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to meete againe at the beginning of Michaelmas Terme. Before this time alſo it was thought conuenient to haue a houſe that might anſwere to M. <hi>Percies,</hi> where we might make prouiſion of powder and wood for the Mine, which beeing there made ready, ſhould in a night be conueyed by boate to the houſe by the Parliament, becauſe wee were loath to foile that with often going in and out. There was none that we could deuiſe ſo fit as <hi>Lambeth,</hi> where Maſter <hi>Catesby</hi> often lay, and to bee keeper thereof (by M. <hi>Catesbies</hi> choice) we receiued into the number, <hi>Keyes,</hi> as a truſtie honeſt man: this was about a moneth before Michaelmas.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="237" facs="tcp:23110:140"/>Some fortnight after towards the beginning of the Terme, M. <hi>Fawkes</hi> and I came to M. <hi>Catesby</hi> at <hi>Morecrofts,</hi> where we agreed that now was time to beginne and ſet things in order for the Mine. So as Maſter <hi>Fawkes</hi> went to <hi>London,</hi> and the next day ſent for me to come ouer to him: when I came, the cauſe was, for that the Scottiſh Lords were appointed to ſit in conference of the Vnion in Maſter <hi>Percies</hi> houſe. This hindered our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning vntill a fortnight before Chriſtmas, by which time both Maſter <hi>Percie</hi> and Maſter <hi>Wright</hi> were come to <hi>London,</hi> and wee againſt their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming had prouided a good part of the powder: ſo as wee all fiue entred with tooles fit to beginne our worke, hauing prouided our ſelues of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked-meates, the leſſe to need ſending abroad. We entred late in the night, and were neuer ſeene ſaue onely Maſter <hi>Percies</hi> man, vntill Chriſtmas Eue, In which time we wrought vnder a little Entry to the wall of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment houſe, and vnderpropped it, as we went, with wood.</p>
                        <p>Whileſt we were together, we began to faſhion our buſineſſe, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed what we ſhould doe after this deed was done. The firſt queſtion was how we might ſurprize the next heire, the Prince haply would bee at the Parliament with the King his Father, how ſhould wee then bee able to ſeaze on the Duke? This burthen Maſter <hi>Percie</hi> vndertooke, that by his acquaintance, hee, with another Gentleman would enter the Chamber without ſuſpition, and hauing ſome doozen others at ſeuerall doores to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his comming, and two or three on horſebacke at the Court gate to receiue him, hee would vndertake (the blow beeing giuen, vntill which hee would attend in the Dukes Chamber) to carrie him ſafe away: for hee ſuppoſed moſt of the Court would bee abſent, and ſuch as were there not ſuſpecting, or vnprouided for any ſuch matter. For the Lady ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH, it were eaſie to ſurprize her in the Countrey, by drawing friends together at an hunting neere the Lord <hi>Haringtons,</hi> and Aſhbie, M. <hi>Catesbies</hi> houſe, being not farre off was a fit place for preparation.</p>
                        <p>The next was for money and horſes, which if wee could prouide in any reaſonable meaſure (hauing the Heire apparant) and the firſt knowledge by foure or fiue dayes, was oddes ſufficient.</p>
                        <p>Then what Lords we ſhould ſaue from the Parliament, which was firſt agreed in generall as many as we could that were Catholickes, or ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: but after we deſcended to ſpeake of particulars.</p>
                        <p>Next, what forraine Princes wee ſhould acquaint with this before, or ioyne with after. For this point wee agreed, that firſt wee could not enioyne Princes to that ſecrecie, nor oblige them by oath, ſo to be ſecure of their promiſe: beſides, we knew not whether they will approue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect or diſlike it: And if they doe allow thereof, to prepare before, might beget ſuſpition, and not to prouide vntill the buſineſſe were acted, the ſame letter that caried newes of the thing done, might as well intreate their helpe and furtherance. <hi>Spaine</hi> is too ſlow in his preparations to hope any good from in the firſt extremities, and <hi>France</hi> too neere and too dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:23110:141"/>who with the ſhipping of <hi>Holland,</hi> we feared of all the world might make away with vs.</p>
                        <p>But while we were in the middle of theſe diſcourſes, we heard that the Parliament ſhould bee anew adiourned vntill after Michaelmas, vpon which tidings we broke off both diſcourſe and working vntill after Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas. About Candlemas we brought ouer in a boate the powder, which we had prouided at Lambeth, and laide it in M. <hi>Percies</hi> houſe, becauſe wee were willing to haue all our danger in one place.</p>
                        <p>We wrought alſo another fortnight in the Mine againſt the ſtone wall, which was very hard to beate thorow; at which time we called in <hi>Kit Wright,</hi> and neare to Eaſter, as we wrought the third time, opportunitie was giuen to hire the Cellar, in which we reſolued to lay the powder, and leaue the Mine.</p>
                        <p>Now by reaſon that the charge of maintaining vs all ſo long together, beſides the number of ſeuerall houſes, which for ſeuerall vſes had beene hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and buying of powder &amp;c. had layen heauie on M. <hi>Catesby</hi> alone to ſupport; it was neceſſarie for him to call in ſome others to eaſe his charge, and to that ende deſired leaue, that hee, with M. <hi>Percy,</hi> and a third, whom they ſhould call, might acquaint whom they thought fit and willing to the buſineſſe: for many, ſaid hee, may be content that I ſhould know, who would not therefore that all the company ſhould be acquainted with their names: to this we all agreed.</p>
                        <p>After this Maſter <hi>Fawkes</hi> laid into the Cellar (which hee had newly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) a thouſand of Billets, and fiue hundred of Faggots, and with that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the Powder, becauſe we might haue the Houſe free, to ſuffer any one to enter that would. Maſter <hi>Catesby</hi> wiſhed vs to conſider, whether it were not now neceſſary to ſend M. <hi>Fawkes</hi> ouer, both to abſent himſelfe for a time, as alſo to acquaint Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> and M. <hi>Owen</hi> with this matter. Wee agreed that he ſhould (prouided that hee gaue it them with the ſame othe that wee had taken it before) <hi>videlicet,</hi> to keepe it ſecret from all the world. The reaſon why we deſired Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> ſhould be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted herewith was, to haue him with vs ſo ſoone as he could: And for M. <hi>Owen,</hi> hee might holde good correſpondencie after with forreine Princes. So M. <hi>Fawkes</hi> departed about Eaſter for <hi>Flanders,</hi> and returned the latter end of Auguſt. He tolde me that when he arriued at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> was not returned from <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſo as hee vttered the matter onely to <hi>Owen,</hi> who ſeemed well pleaſed with the buſineſſe, but tolde him that fure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sir <hi>William</hi> would not be acquainted with any plot, as hauing buſineſſe now afoot in the Court of <hi>England;</hi> but he himſelfe would be alwayes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to tell it him, and ſend him away ſo ſoone as it were done.</p>
                        <p>About this time did M. <hi>Percy</hi> and M. <hi>Catesby</hi> meete at the <hi>Bathe,</hi> where they agreed that the company being yet but few, M. <hi>Catesby</hi> ſhould haue the others authoritie to call in whom hee thought beſt; By which autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie hee called in after, Sir <hi>Euerard Digby,</hi> though at what time I know not,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:23110:141"/>and laſt of all M. <hi>Francis Treſham.</hi> The firſt promiſed, as I heard M. <hi>Catesby</hi> ſay, fifteene hundred pounds; the ſecond two thouſand pounds; M. <hi>Percy</hi> himſelfe promiſed all that hee could get of the Earle of <hi>Northumberlands</hi> rents, which was about foure thouſand pounds, and to prouide many gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping horſes to the number of ten.</p>
                        <p>Meane while M. <hi>Fawkes</hi> and my ſelfe alone bought ſome new Powder, as ſuſpecting the firſt to be danke, and conueyed it into the Cellar, and ſet it in order, as wee reſolued it ſhould ſtand. Then was the Parliament anew prorogued vntill the fift of Nouember, ſo as we all went downe vntil ſome ten dayes before, when M. <hi>Catesby</hi> came vp with M. <hi>Fawkes</hi> to an houſe by <hi>Enfield Chace</hi> called <hi>White-webbes,</hi> whither I came to them, and M. <hi>Catesby</hi> willed me to enquire whether the yong Prince came to the Parliament: I tolde him that I heard that his Grace thought not to be there. Then muſt wee haue our Horſes ſaid M. <hi>Catesby</hi> beyond the water, and prouiſion of more company to ſurpriſe the Prince, and leaue the Duke alone.</p>
                        <p>Two dayes after being Sunday at night, in came one to my chamber, and told me that a letter had beene giuen to my L. <hi>Mountegle</hi> to this effect, That he wiſhed his Lordſhips abſence from the Parliament, becauſe a blow would there be giuen; which letter he preſently caried to my L. of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On the morrow I went to <hi>White-webbes,</hi> and told it M. <hi>Catesby,</hi> aſſuring him withall that the matter was diſcloſed; and wiſhing him in any caſe to forſake his Countrey. He told me he would ſee further as yet, and reſolued to ſend M. <hi>Fawkes</hi> to trie the vttermoſt, proteſting if the part belonged to himſelfe, he would trie the ſame aduenture.</p>
                        <p>On Wedneſday Maſter <hi>Fawkes</hi> went and returned at night, of which we were very glad.</p>
                        <p>Thurſday I came to London, and Friday Maſter <hi>Catesby,</hi> Maſter <hi>Treſham</hi> and I met at <hi>Barnet,</hi> where wee queſtioned how this Letter ſhould be ſent to my L. <hi>Mountegle,</hi> but could not conceiue, for Maſter <hi>Treſham</hi> forſware it, whom we onely ſuſpected.</p>
                        <p>On Saturday night I met M. <hi>Treſham</hi> againe in Lincolnes Inne walkes: wherein he tolde ſuch ſpeeches, that my Lord of <hi>Salisbury</hi> ſhould vſe to the King, as I gaue it loſt the ſecond time, and repeated the ſame to M. <hi>Catesby,</hi> who hereupon was reſolued to be gone, but ſtayed to haue M. <hi>Percy</hi> come vp, whoſe conſent herein wee wanted. On Sunday M. <hi>Percy</hi> being dealt with to that end, would needs abide the vttermoſt triall.</p>
                        <p>This ſuſpicion of all hands put vs into ſuch confuſion, as M. <hi>Catesby</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to goe downe into the countrey the Munday that M. <hi>Percy</hi> went to <hi>Syon,</hi> and M. <hi>Percy</hi> reſolued to follow the ſame night, or early the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. About fiue of the clocke being Tueſday, came the yonger <hi>Wright</hi> to my Chamber, and tolde me that a Nobleman called the L. <hi>Mountegle,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Ariſe, and come along to <hi>Eſſex</hi> houſe, for I am going to call vp my L. of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> ſaying withall, The matter is diſcouered Goe backe M. <hi>Wright</hi> (quoth I) and learne what you can about <hi>Eſſex</hi> gate. Shortly hee
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:23110:142"/>returned and ſaid, Surely all is loſt: for <hi>Lepton</hi> is got on horſebacke at <hi>Eſsex</hi> doore, and as he parted, he asked if their Lordſhips would haue any more with him: and being anſwered No, is rode faſt vp Fleetſtreete as hee can ride. Goe you then (quoth I) to M. <hi>Percy,</hi> for ſure it is for him they ſeeke, and bid him be gone, I will ſtay and ſee the vttermoſt. Then I went to the Court gates, and found them ſtraitly guarded, ſo as no body could enter. From thence I went downe towards the Parliament houſe, and in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of Kings-ſtreet, found the Guard ſtanding that would not let me paſſe. And as I returned I heard one ſay, There is a Treaſon diſcouered, in which the King and the Lords ſhould haue beene blowen vp. So then I was fully ſatisfied that all was knowen, and went to the Stable where my gelding ſtood, and rode into the countrey. Maſter <hi>Catesby</hi> had appointed our mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at <hi>Dunchurch,</hi> but I could not ouertake them vntill I came to my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which was Wedneſday night. On Thurſday wee tooke the Armour at my Lord <hi>Windſores,</hi> and went that night to one <hi>Stephen Littletons</hi> houſe, where the next day (being Friday) as I was early abroad to diſcouer, my man came to me, and ſaid, that an heauie miſchance had ſeuered all the company, for that M. <hi>Catesby,</hi> M. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and M. <hi>Grant,</hi> were burned with Gunpowder vpon which ſight the reſt diſperſed. Maſter <hi>Littleton</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed me to flie, and ſo would hee. I told him I would firſt ſee the body of my friend and bury him, whatſoeuer befell me. When I came, I found M. <hi>Catesby</hi> reaſonable well, Maſter <hi>Percy,</hi> both the <hi>Wrights,</hi> M. <hi>Rookwood,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Grant.</hi> I asked them what they reſolued to doe: they anſwered, We meane here to die. I ſaid againe, I would take ſuch part as they did. About eleuen of the clocke came the company to beſet the houſe, and as I walked into the court, I was ſhot into the ſhoulder, which loſt me the vſe of mine arme: the next ſhot was the elder <hi>Wright</hi> ſtricken dead, after him the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger M. <hi>Wright,</hi> and fourthly <hi>Ambroſe Rookwood</hi> ſhot. Then ſaid M. <hi>Catesby</hi> to me, (ſtanding before the doore they were to enter) Stand by me <hi>Tom,</hi> and we will die together. Sir (quoth I) I haue loſt the vſe of my right arme, and I feare that will cauſe me to be taken. So as wee ſtood cloſe together, M. <hi>Catesby,</hi> M. <hi>Percy,</hi> and my ſelfe, they two were ſhot (as farre as I could gueſſe with one Bullet) and then the company entred vpon me, hurt me in the Belly with a Pike, and gaue me other wounds, vntill one came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, and caught holde of both mine armes.</p>

The newes was no ſooner ſpred abroad that morning, which was vpon a Tueſday, the 5. of <hi>Nouember,</hi> and the firſt day deſigned for that Seſſion of Parliament; The newes (I ſay) of this ſo ſtrange and vnlooked for accident, was no ſooner diuulged, but ſome of thoſe Conſpiratours, namely <hi>Winter,</hi> and the two brothers of <hi>Wrights</hi> thought it high time for them to haſten out of the towne (for <hi>Catesby</hi> was gone the night before, and <hi>Percy</hi> at foure of the clocke in the morning the ſame day of the Diſcouerie) and all of them held their courſe, with more haſte then good ſpeed to <hi>Warwick</hi> Shire toward <hi>Couentry,</hi> where the next day morning being <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> and about the ſame houre that <hi>Fawks</hi> was taken in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> one <hi>Graunt</hi> a gentleman hauing aſſociated vnto him ſome others of his opinion, all violent Papiſts and ſtrong Recuſants, came to a Stable of one <hi>Benocke</hi> a rider of great
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:23110:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>Horſes,
<note place="margin">The taking of the horſes out of the ſtable at Warwicke by <hi>Granut</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> and hauing violently broken vp the ſame, caried along with them all the great Horſes that were therein, to the number of ſeuen or eight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to diuers Noblemen and Gentlemen of that Countrey, who had put them into the Riders hands to be made fit for ther ſeruice. And ſo both that company of them which fledde out of <hi>London,</hi> as alſo <hi>Graunt</hi> and his complices met all together at <hi>Dunchurch</hi> at Sir <hi>Euerard Digby</hi> his lodging the Tueſday at night, after the diſcouerie of this treacherous Attempt: The which <hi>Digby</hi> had likewiſe for his part appointed a match of hunting to haue beene hunted the next day,
<note place="margin">The hunting match ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Sir <hi>Euerard Digby.</hi>
               </note> which was Wedneſday, though his mind was <hi>Nimrod</hi>-like vpon a farre other maner of hunting, more bent vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the blood of reaſonable men then bruite beaſts.</p>
            <p>This company and helliſh ſocietie thus conuened, finding their purpoſe diſcouered,
<note place="margin">Their going into armes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Plot diſcouered.</note> and their treacherie preuented, did reſolue to runne a deſperate courſe, and ſince they could not preuaile by ſo priuate a Blow, to practiſe by a publike rebellion, either to attaine to their Intents, or at leaſt to ſaue themſelues in the throng of others. And therefore gathering all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany they could vnto them, and pretending the quarrell of Religion, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing intercepted ſuch prouiſion of Armour, Horſes, and Powder, as the time could permit, thought by running vp and downe the Countrey both to augment peece and peece their number (dreaming to themſelues that they had the vertue of a Snow-ball, which being little at the firſt, and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling downe from a great hill groweth to a great quantitie, by encreaſing it ſelfe with the Snow that it meeteth by the way) and alſo that they begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning firſt this braue ſhewe in one part of the Countrey, ſhould by their Sympathy and example ſtirre vp and encourage the reſt of their Religion in other parts of <hi>England</hi> to riſe, as they had done there. But when they had gathered their force to the greateſt,
<note place="margin">Their number neuer aboue foureſcore.</note> they came not to the number of foureſcore, and yet were they troubled all the houres of the day to keepe and containe their own ſeruants from ſtealing from them; who (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of all their care) daily left them, being farre inferiour to <hi>Gedeons</hi> hoſte in number, but farre more in faith or iuſtneſſe of quarrell.</p>
            <p>And ſo after that this Catholicke troupe had wandered a while through Warwicke-ſhire to Worceſter-ſhire, and from thence to the edge and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Stafford-ſhire, this gallantly armed band had not the honour at the laſt to be beaten with a Kings Lieutenant or extraordinary Commiſsioner ſent downe for the purpoſe,
<note place="margin">Their flight.</note> but onely by the ordinary Shiriffe of Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-ſhire were they all beaten, killed, taken and diſperſed. Wherein yee haue to note this following circumſtance ſo admirable, and ſo liuely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing the greatneſſe of Gods iuſtice, as it could not be concealed without betraying in a maner the glory due to the Almighty for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Although diuers of the Kings Proclamations were poſted downe after theſe Traitors with all the ſpeed poſſible, declaring the odiouſneſſe of that bloodie attempt, the neceſſitie to haue had <hi>Percie</hi> preſerued aliue, if it had beene poſſible, and the aſſembly together of that rightly-damned crew,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:23110:143"/>now no more darned Conſpirators, but open and auowed Rebels: yet the farre diſtance of the way (which was aboue an hundred miles) together with the extreme deepeneſſe thereof, ioyned alſo with the ſhortneſſe of the day, was the cauſe that the heartie and louing affections of the Kings good Subiects in thoſe partes preuented the ſpeed of his Proclamations: For vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the third day after the flying downe of theſe Rebels,
<note place="margin">Ouertaken at <hi>Holbeech,</hi> in Stafford ſhire, <hi>Stephen Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> houſe.</note> which was vpon the Friday next after the diſcouerie of their Plot, they were moſt of them all ſurprized by the Shiriffe of Worceſter-ſhire at <hi>Holbeach,</hi> about the noone of the day, and that in manner following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Graunt,</hi> of whom I haue made mention before for taking the great hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, who had not all the preceding time ſtirred from his owne houſe till the next morning after the attempt ſhould haue bene put in execution, he then laying his accompt without his Hoſt (as the prouerbe is) that their Plot had, without failing, receiued the day before their hoped-for ſucceſſe; Tooke, or rather ſtole out thoſe horſes (as I ſaid before) for enabling him, and ſo many of that ſoule-leſſe ſociety that had ſtill remained in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey neere about him, to make a ſudden ſurprize vpon the Kings elder daughter, the Lady ELIZABETH, hauing her reſidence nere by that place,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Grant</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </note> whom they thought to haue vſed for the colour of their treacherous deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne (His Maieſtie her father, her mother, and male children being all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed aboue.) And to this purpoſe alſo had that <hi>Nimrod, Digby,</hi> prouided his hunting match againſt that ſame time, that numbers of people beeing flocked together vpon the pretence thereof, they might the eaſilier haue brought to paſſe the ſudden ſurpriſe of her perſon.</p>
            <p>Now the violent taking away of thoſe horſes long before day, did ſeeme to bee ſo great a ryot in the eyes of the Common-people, that knew of no greater myſtery: And the bold attempting thereof did ingender ſuch a ſuſpition of ſome following Rebellion in the hearts of the wiſer ſort, as both great and ſmall beganne to ſtirre and arme themſelues, vpon this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked-for accident: Among whom Sir <hi>Fulke Greuill</hi> the Elder, Knight, as became one both ſo ancient in yeeres and good reputation, and by his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, beeing Deputie Lieutenant of Warwicke-ſhire, though vnable in his bodie, yet by the zeale and trew feruencie of his mind, did firſt apprehend this foreſaid Ryot to be nothing but the ſparkles and ſure <hi>indices</hi> of a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Rebellion; whereupon both ſtoutly and honeſtly hee tooke order to get into his owne hands, the Munition and Armour of all ſuch Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men about him, as were either abſent from their owne houſes, or in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full guard; and alſo ſent ſuch direction to the Townes about him, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon did follow the ſtriking of <hi>Winter</hi> by a poore Smith, who had likewiſe beene taken by thoſe vulgar people, but that he was reſcued by the reſt of his company, who perceiuing that the Countrey before them had notice of them, haſtened away with loſſe in their owne ſight, ſixteene of their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers being taken by the towneſ-men, and ſent preſently to the Shiriffe at Warwicke, and from thence to London.</p>
            <p>

For if thoſe

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:23110:146"/>2. For although the onely reaſon they gaue for plotting ſo heinous an attempt, was the zeale they caried to the Romiſh Religion; yet were neuer any other of that profeſsion the worſe vſed for that cauſe, as by our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Proclamation immediatly after the diſcouery of the ſaid fact doeth plainly appeare: onely at the next ſitting downe againe of the Parliament, there were Lawes made, ſetting downe ſome ſuch orders as were thought fit for preuenting the like miſchiefe in time to come. Amongſt which a forme of OATH was framed to be taken by my Subiects, whereby they ſhould make a cleare profeſſion of their reſolution, faithfully to perſiſt in their obedience vnto mee, according to their naturall allegiance; To the end that I might hereby make a ſeparation, not onely betweene all my good Subiects in generall, and vnfaithfull Traitors, that intended to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelues from my obedience; But ſpecially to make a ſeparation betweene ſo many of my Subiects, who although they were otherwiſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhly affected, yet retained in their hearts the print of their naturall due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to their Soueraigne; and thoſe who being caried away with the like fanaticall zeale that the Powder-Traitors were, could not conteine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues within the bounds of their naturall Allegiance, but thought diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of religion a ſafe pretext for all kinde of treaſons, and rebellions againſt their Soueraigne. Which godly and wiſe intent, God did bleſſe with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe accordingly: For very many of my Subiects that were Popiſhly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, aſwell Prieſts, as Layicks, did freely take the ſame Oath: whereby they both gaue me occaſion to thinke the better of their fidelitie, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe freed themſelues of that heauie ſlander, that although they were fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low profeſſors of one Religion with the powder-Traitors, yet were they not ioyned with them in treaſonable courſes againſt their Soueraigne; whereby all quietly minded Papiſts were put out of deſpaire, and I gaue a good proofe that I intended no perſecution againſt them for conſcience cauſe, but onely deſired to be ſecured of them for ciuill obedience, which for conſcience cauſe they were bound to performe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But the diuel could not haue deuiſed a more malicious tricke for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting this ſo calme and clement a courſe, then fell out by the ſending hither, and publiſhing a <hi>Breue</hi> of the Popes, countermanding all them of his profeſſion to take this Oath; Thereby ſowing new ſeeds of ielouſie betweene me and my Popiſh Subiects, by ſtirring them vp to diſobey that lawfull commandement of their Soueraigne, which was ordeined to bee taken of them as a pledge of their fidelitie; And ſo by their refuſall of ſo iuſt a charge, to giue mee ſo great and iuſt a ground for puniſhment of them, without touching any matter of conſcience: throwing themſelues needleſly into one of theſe deſperate ſtraits; either with the loſſe of their liues and goods to renounce their Allegiance to their naturall Soueraigne; or elſe to procure the condemnation of their ſoules by renouncing the Catholicke faith, as he alleadgeth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And on the other part, although diſparitie of Religion (the Pope
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:23110:146"/>being head of the contrary part) can permit no intelligence nor intercourſe of meſſengers betweene mee and the Pope: yet there being no denounced warre betweene vs, he hath by this action broken the rules of common ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilitie and iuſtice betweene Chriſtian Princes, in thus condemning me vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, both by accounting me a perſecutor, which cannot be but implied by exhorting the Papiſts to endure Martyrdome; as likewiſe by ſo ſtraitly commanding all thoſe of his profeſſion in England, to refuſe the taking of this Oath; thereby refuſing to profeſſe their naturall obedience to me their Soueraigne. For if he thinke himſelfe my lawfull Iudge, wherefore hath he condemned me vnheard? And, if he haue nothing to doe with me and my gouernment (as indeed he hath not) why doeth he <hi>mittere falcem in alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam meſſem,</hi> to meddle betweene me and my Subiects, eſpecially in matters that meerely and onely concerne ciuill obedience? And yet could <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> in his greateſt fury and auowed quarrell againſt the late Queene, doe no more iniurie vnto her; then hee hath in this caſe offered vnto mee, without ſo much as a pretended or an alleadged cauſe. For what difference there is, betweene the commanding Subiects to rebell, and looſing them from their Oath of Allegiance as <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> did; and the commanding of Subiects not to obey in making profeſſion of their Oath of their duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Allegiance, as this Pope hath now done: no man can eaſily diſcerne.</p>

Therein hauing as well in this reſpect as in the former, dealt both vndiſcreetly with me, and iniuriouſly with his owne Catholickes. With mee; in not refuting particularly what ſpeciall words he quarrelled in that Oath; which if hee had done, it might haue beene that for the fatherly care I haue not to put any of my Subiects to a needleſſe extremitie, I might haue beene contented in ſome ſort to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed or interpreted thoſe wordes. With his owne Catholickes: for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if I had ſo done, they had beene thereby fully eaſed in that buſineſſe; or at leaſt if I would not haue condeſcended to haue altered any thing in the ſaide Oath, yet would thereby ſome appearance or ſhadow of excuſe haue beene left vnto them for refuſing the ſame not as ſeeming thereby to ſwarue from their Obedience and Allegiance vnto mee, but onely beeing ſtayed from taking the ſame vpon the ſcrupulous tenderneſſe of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, in regard of thoſe particular words which the Pope had noted and condemned therein.</p>

                  <hi>Which things ſince they are thus; it must euidently appeare vnto you by the words themſelues, That ſuch an Oath cannot be taken without hurting of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Faith, and the ſaluation of your ſoules; ſeeing it conteines many things which are flat contrary to Faith and ſaluation. Wherefore wee doe admoniſh you, that you doe vtterly abſtaine from taking this and the like Oathes: which thing wee doe the more earneſtly require of you, becauſe wee haue experience of the conſtancie of your faith, which is tried like gold in the fire of perpetuall tribulation. Wee doe well know, that you will cheerefully vnder-goe all kinde of cruell torments whatſoeuer, yea and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly endure death it ſelfe, rather then you will in any thing offend the Maieſtie of</hi> GOD. <hi>And this our confidence is confirmed by thoſe things, which are dayly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported vnto vs, of the ſingular vertue, valour, and fortitude which in theſe laſt times doeth no leſſe ſhine in your</hi> Martyrs, <hi>then it did in the firſt beginning of the Church. Stand therefore, your loynes being girt about with veritie, and hauing on the breſt-plate of righteouſneſſe, taking the ſhield of Faith, be ye ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might; And let nothing hinder you. Hee which will crowne you, and doeth in Heauen behold your conflicts, will finiſh the good worke which hee hath begun in you.

Wherein, beſides the maine vntrewth whereby I am ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuriouſly vſed, I muſt euer auow and maintaine, as the trewth is according to mine owne knowledge, that the late Queene of famous memory, neuer puniſhed any Papiſt for Religion, but that their owne puniſhment was euer extorted out of her hands againſt her will, by their owne misbehauiour, which both the time and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of her actions will manifeſtly make proofe of. For before <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> his excommunication giuing her ouer for a prey, and ſetting her Subiects at libertie to rebell, it is well knowne ſhe neuer medled with the blood or hard puniſhment of any Catholique, nor made any rigorous Lawes againſt them. And ſince that time, who liſt to compare with an indifferent eye, the manifold intended inuaſions againſt her whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:23110:148"/>the forreine practiſes, the internall publike rebellions, the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate plots and machinations, poyſonings, murthers, and all ſorts of deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>&amp; quid non?</hi> daily ſet abroach; and all theſe wares continually foſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fomented from <hi>Rome;</hi> together with the continuall corrupting of her Subiects, as well by temporall bribes, as by faire and ſpecious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of eternall felicitie; and nothing but booke vpon booke publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet foorth by her fugitiues, for approbation of ſo holy deſignes: who liſt, I ſay, with an indifferent eye, to looke on the one part, vpon thoſe infinite and intollerable temptations, and on the other part vpon the iuſt, yet moderate puniſhment of a part of theſe hainous offendors; ſhall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſee that that bleſſed defunct LADIE was as free from perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they ſhall free theſe helliſh Inſtruments from the honour of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But now hauing ſacrificed (if I may ſo ſay) to the <hi>Manes</hi> of my late Predeceſſour, I may next with Saint PAVL iuſtly vindicate mine owne fame, from thoſe innumerable calumnies ſpread againſt me, in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying the trewth of my behauiour toward the Papiſts: wherein I may trewly affirme, That whatſoeuer was her iuſt and mercifull Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer the Papiſts in her time, my Gouernement ouer them ſince hath ſo farre exceeded hers, in Mercie and Clemencie, as not onely the Papiſts themſelues grewe to that height of pride, in confidence of my mildneſſe, as they did directly expect, and aſſuredly promiſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues libertie of Conſcience, and equalitie with other of my Subiects in all things; but euen a number of the beſt and faithfullieſt of my ſayde Subiects, were caſt in great feare and amazement of my courſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, euer prognoſticating and iuſtly ſuſpecting that ſowre fruite to come of it, which ſhewed it ſelfe clearely in the Powder-Treaſon. How many did I honour with Knighthood, of knowen and open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants? How indifferently did I giue audience, and acceſſe to both ſides, beſtowing equally all fauours and honours on both profeſſions? How free and continuall acceſſe, had all rankes and degrees of Papiſts in my Court and company? And aboue all, how frankely and freely did I free Recuſants of their ordinarie paiments? Beſides, it is cuident what ſtrait order was giuen out of my owne mouth to the Iudges, to ſpare the execution of all Prieſts, (notwithſtanding their conuiction,) ioyning thereunto a gracious Proclamation, whereby all Prieſts, that were at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and not taken, might goe out of the countrey by ſuch a day: my generall Pardon hauing beene extended to all conuicted Prieſtes in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: whereupon they were ſet at libertie as good Subiects: and all Prieſts that were taken after, ſent ouer and ſet at libertie there. But time and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per will faile me to make enumeration of all the benefits and fauours that I beſtowed in generall and particular vpon Papiſts: in recounting whereof, euery ſcrape of my penne would ſerue but for a blot of the Popes ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and iniuſtice, in meating me with ſo hard a meaſure for the ſame. So
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:23110:149"/>as I thinke I haue ſufficiently, or at leaſt with good reaſon wiped the
<note n="*" place="margin">Magno cum anims moerore, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>teares</hi> from the Popes eyes, for complaining vpon ſuch perſecution, who if hee had beene but politickely wiſe, although hee had had no reſpect to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Veritie, would haue in this complaint of his, made a difference betweene my preſent time, and the time of the late Queene: And ſo by his commending of my moderation, in regard of former times, might haue had hope to haue mooued me to haue continued in the ſame clement courſe: For it is a trew ſaying, that alledged kindneſſe vpon noble mindes, doeth euer worke much. And for the maine vntrewth of any perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in my time, it can neuer bee prooued, that any were, or are put to death ſince I came to the Crowne for cauſe of Conſcience; except that now this diſcharge giuen by the Pope to all Catholiques to take their Oath of Allegiance to me, be the cauſe of the due puniſhment of many: which if it fall out to be, let the blood light vpon the Popes head, who is the onely cauſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>As for the next point contained in his <hi>Breue</hi> concerning his diſcharge of all Papiſts to come to our Church, or frequent our rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, I am not to meddle at this time with that matter, becauſe my er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand now onely is to publiſh to the world the Iniurie and Iniuſtice done vnto me, in diſcharging my ſubiects to make profeſſion of their obedience vnto mee.
<note place="margin">The intende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this diſcourſe.</note> Now as to the point where the Oath is quarrelled, it is ſet downe in fewe, but very weighty wordes; to wit, <hi>That it ought to be cleare vnto all Catholiques, that this Oath cannot bee taken with ſafetie of the Catholique Faith, and of their ſoules health, ſince it containeth many things that are plainely and directly contrarie to their faith and ſaluation.</hi> To this, the old ſaying fathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon the Philoſopher, may very fitly bee applied, <hi>Multa dicit, ſed pauca probat;</hi> nay indeed, <hi>Nihil omnino probat:</hi> For how the profeſſion of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Allegiance of Subiects to their Prince can be directly oppoſite to the faith and ſaluation of ſoules, is ſo farre beyond my ſimple reading in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, as I muſt thinke it a ſtrange and new Aſſertion, to proceede out of the mouth of that pretended generall Paſtor of all Chriſtian ſoules. I reade indeede, and not in one, or two, or three places of Scripture, that Subiects are bound to obey their Princes for conſcience ſake, whether they were good or wicked Princes.

And for that cauſe the ſame men doe goe about to perſwade you, that our commands in the ſaid Letters are not to be regarded. Surely this newes did trouble vs; and that ſo much the more, becauſe hauing had experience of your obedience (most dearely beloued ſonnes) who to the end ye might obey this holy Sea, haue godlily and valiantly contemned your ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches wealth, honour, libertie, yea and life it ſelfe; wee ſhould neuer haue ſuspected that the trewth of our Apostolike Letters could once be called into question among you, that by this pretence ye might exempt your ſelues from our Commandements. But we doe herein perceiue the ſubtiltie and craft of the enemie of mans ſaluation, and we doe attribute this your backwardneſſe rather to him, then to your owne will. And for this cauſe, wee haue thought good to write the ſecond time vnto you, and to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vnto you againe, That our Apostolike Letters dated the last yeere on the tenth of the Calends of October, concerning the prohibition of the Oath, were written not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon our proper motion, and of our certaine knowledge, but alſo after long and weightie deliberation vſed concerning all thoſe things, which are contained in them; and that for that cauſe ye are bound fully to obſerue them, reiecting all interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perſwading to the contrary. And this is our meere, pure, and perfect will, being alwayes carefull of your ſaluation, and alwayes minding thoſe things, which are most profitable vnto you. And we doe pray without ceaſing, that hee that hath appointed our lowlineſſe to the keeping of the flocke of Chriſt, would inlighten our thoughts and our counſels: whom we doe alſo continually deſire, that he would increaſe in you (our beloued Sonnes) faith, constancie, and mutuall charitie and peace one to another.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Euerend Sir, and brother in <hi>CHRIST;</hi> It is almoſt fourtie yeeres ſince we did ſee one the other: but yet I haue neuer bene vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of our ancient acquaintance, neither haue I ceaſed, ſeeing I could doe you no other good, to commend your labouring most pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the Lords Vineyard, in my prayers to God. And I doubt not, but that I haue liued all this while in your memory, and haue had ſome place in your prayers at the Lords Altar. So therfore euen vnto this time we haue abidden, as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh, in the mutuall loue one of the other, not by word or letter, but in deed and trewth. But alate meſsage which was brought vnto vs within theſe few dayes, of your bonds and impriſonment, hath inforced mee to breake off this ſilence; which meſſage, although it ſeemed heauie in regard of the loſſe which that Church hath receiued, by their being thus depriued of the comfort of your pastorall function amongst them, yet withall it ſeemed ioyous, becauſe you drew neere vnto the glory of <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> then the which gift of God there is none more happy; That you, who haue fedde your flocke ſo many yeeres with the word and doctrine, ſhould now feed it more gloriouſly by the example of your patience. But another heauie tidings did not a little diſquiet and almost take away this ioy, which immediatly followed, of the aduerſaries aſſault, and peraduenture of the ſlip and fall of your constancie in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an vnlawfull Oath. Neither trewly (most deare brother) could that Oath therefore bee lawfull, becauſe it was offered in ſort tempered and modified: for you know that thoſe kinde of modifications are nothing elſe, but ſleights and ſubtilties of Satan, that the Catholique faith touching the Primacie of the Sea Apostolike, might either ſecretly or openly be ſhot at; for the which faith ſo many worthy Martyrs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in that very <hi>England</hi> it ſelfe, haue reſisted vnto blood. For most certaine it is, that in whatſoeuer words the Oath is conceiued by the aduerſaries of the faith in that Kingdome, it tends to this end, that the Authoritie of the head of the Church in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> may bee transferred from the ſucceſſour of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> to the ſucceſſour of King <hi>Henry the eight:</hi> For that which is pretended of the danger of the Kings life, if the high Priest ſhould haue the ſame power in <hi>England,</hi> which hee hath in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christian Kingdomes, it is altogether idle, as all that haue any vnderstanding, may eaſily perceiue. For it was neuer heard of from the Churches infancie vntill this day, that euer any <hi>Pope</hi> did command, that any Prince, though an Heretike, though an Ethnike, though a perſecutour, ſhould be murdered; or did approue of the fact, when it was done by any other. And why, I pray you, doeth onely the King of <hi>England</hi> ſeare that, which none of all other the Princes in Christendome either doeth feare, or euer did feare?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="261" facs="tcp:23110:152"/>But, as I ſaid, theſe vaine pretexts are but the traps and ſtratagemes of Satan: Of which kinde I could produce not a fewe out of ancient Stories, if I went about to write a Booke and not an Epiſtle. One onely for example ſake, I will call to your memory. <hi>S. Gregorius Nazianzenus</hi> in his firſt Oration againſt <hi>Iulian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, reporteth, That hee, the more eaſily to beguile the ſimple Chriſtians, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Images of the falſe gods into the pictures of the Emperour, which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes did vſe to bow downe vnto with a ciuill kinde of reuerence: ſo that no man could doe reuerence to the Emperours picture, but withall hee muſt adore the Images of the falſe gods; whereupon it came to paſſe that many were deceiued. And if there were any that found out the Emperours craft and refuſed to worſhip his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, thoſe were moſt grieuouſly puniſhed, as men that had contemned the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in his Image. Some ſuch like thing, me thinkes, I ſee in the Oath that is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to you; which is ſo craftily compoſed, that no man can deteſt Treaſon againſt the King and make profeſsion of his Ciuill ſubiection, but he muſt bee constramed perfidiouſly to denie the Primacie of the Apostolicke Sea. But the ſeruants of Christ, and especially the chiefe Prieſts of the Lord, ought to bee ſo farre from taking an vnlawfull Oath, where they may indamage the Faith, that they ought to beware that they giue not the leaſt ſuspicion of diſsimulation that they haue taken it, leaſt they might ſeeme to haue left any example of preuarication to faithfull people. Which thing that worthy <hi>Eleazar</hi> did most notably performe, who would neither eate ſwines fleſh, nor ſo much as faine to haue eaten it, although hee ſawe the great torments that did hang ouer his head; least, as himſelfe ſpeaketh in the ſecond Booke of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> many young men might bee brought through that ſimulation, to preuaricate with the Lawe. Neither did <hi>Baſil</hi> the Great by his example, which is more fit for our purpoſe, cary himſelfe leſſe worthily toward <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour. For as <hi>Theodoret</hi> writeth in his Historie, when the Deputy of that hereticall Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour did perſwade Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> that hee would not reſist the Emperour for a little ſubtiltie of a few points of doctrine; that most holy and prudent man made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, <hi>That it was not to be indured, that the leaſt ſyllable of Gods word ſhould bee corrupted, but rather all kind of torment was to be embraced, for the maintenance of the Trewth thereof.</hi> Now I ſuppoſe, that there wants not amongst you, who ſay that they are but ſubtilties of Opinions that are contained in the Oath that is offered to the Catholikes, and that you are not to ſtrius againſt the Kings Authoritie for ſuch a little matter. But there are not wanting alſo amongst you holy men like vnto <hi>Baſil</hi> the Great, which will openly auow, that the very leaſt ſyllable of Gods diuine Trewth is not to bee corrupted, though many torments were to bee endured, and death it ſelfe ſet before you: Amongst whom it is meete, that you ſhould bee one, or rather the Standard bearer, and Generall to the reſt. And whatſoeuer hath beene the cauſe, that your Conſtancie hath quailed, whether it bee the ſuddaineneſſe of your apprehenſion, or the bitterneſſe of your perſecution, or the imbecilitie of your old aage: yet wee truſt in the goodneſſe of God, and in your owne long continued vertue, that it will come to paſſe, that as you ſeeme in ſome part to haue imitated the fall of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> ſo you ſhall happily imitate their valour in recouering your ſtrength, and maintaining the Trewth: For if you will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently weigh the whole matter with your ſelfe, trewly you ſhall ſee, it is no ſmall
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:23110:153"/>matter that is called in queſtion by this Oath, but one of the principall heads of our Faith, and foundations of Catholique Religion. For heare what your Apostle <hi>Saint Gregorie</hi> the Great hath written in his <hi>24.</hi> Epiſtle of his <hi>11.</hi> Booke. <hi>Let not the reuerence due to the Apoſtolique Sea, be troubled by any mans preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for then the ſtate of the members doeth remaine entire, when the Head of the Faith is not bruiſed by any iniurie:</hi> Therefore by <hi>Saint Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> testimonie, when they are buſie about diſturbing or diminiſhing, or taking away of the Primacie of the Apoſtolique Sea; then are they buſie about cutting off the very head of the faith, and diſſoluing of the ſtate of the whole body, and of all the members.

You haue fought a good fight a long time, you haue wel-neere finiſhed your courſe; ſo many yeeres haue you kept the faith: do not therefore loſe the reward of ſuch labors; do not depriue your ſelfe of that crowne of righteouſnes, which ſo long agone is prepared for you; Do not make the faces of ſo many yours both brethren and children aſhamed.

But rather on the contrary, which we aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope, and for which we continually powre forth prayers to God, display gloriouſly the banner of faith, and make to reioyce the Church, which you haue made heauy; ſo ſhall you not onely merite pardon at Gods hands, but a Crowne.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd now that I am to enter into the field againſt him by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing his Letter, I muſt firſt vſe this proteſtation; That no deſire of vaine-glory by matching with ſo learned a man, maketh me to vndertake this taske; but onely the care and conſcience I haue, that ſuch ſmooth <hi>Circes</hi> charmes and guilded pilles, as full of exterior eloquence, as of inward vntrewths, may not haue that publike paſſage through the world without an anſwere: whereby my reputation might vniuſtly be darkened, by ſuch cloudie and foggie miſts of vntrewths and falſe imputations, the hearts of vnſtayed and ſimple men be miſſe-led, and the trewth it ſelfe ſmothered.</p>
                  <p>But before I come to the particular anſwere of this Letter,
<note place="margin">A great miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the ſtate of the Queſtion, and caſe in hand.</note> I muſt here deſire the world to wonder with me, at the committing of ſo groſſe an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by ſo learned a man as that he ſhould haue pained himſelfe to haue ſet downe ſo elaborate a Letter, for the refutation of a quite miſtaken que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: For it appeareth, that our Engliſh Fugitiues, of whoſe inward ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with him he ſo greatly vaunteth, haue ſo faſt hammered in his head the Oath of Supremacie, which hath euer bene ſo great a ſcarre vnto them, as he thinking by his Letter to haue refuted the laſt Oath, hath in place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of onely paied the Oath of Supremacie, which was moſt in his head; as a man that being earneſtly caried in his thoughts vpon another matter, then he is preſently in doing, will often name the matter or perſon he is think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, in place of the other thing he hath at that time in hand.</p>
                  <p>For as the Oath of Supremacie was deuiſed for putting a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Papiſts, and them of our profeſſion: ſo was this Oath,

Yet doeth all his Letter runne vpon an Inuectiue againſt the compulſion of Catholiques to deny the authoritie of <hi>S. Peters</hi> ſucceſſors, and in place thereof to acknowledge the Succeſſors of King <hi>Henry the eight:</hi> For in K. <hi>Henry the eights</hi> time, was the Oath of Supremacie firſt made: By him were <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> and <hi>Roffenſis</hi> put to death, partly for refuſing of it: From his time till now, haue all the Princes of this land profeſſing this Religion, ſucceſſiuely in effect maintained the ſame: and in that Oath onely is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Kings abſolute power, to be Iudge ouer all perſons, aſwell Ciuill as Eccleſiaſtical, excluding al forraigne powers and Potentates to be Iudges within his dominions; whereas this laſt made Oath containeth no ſuch

                  <p>And that it may the better appeare, that whereas by name hee ſeemeth to condemne the laſt Oath; yet indeed his whole Letter runneth vpon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but vpon the condemnation of the Oath of Supremacie: I haue here thought good to ſet downe the ſaid Oath, leauing it then to the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of euery indifferent reader to iudge, whether he doth not in ſubſtance onely anſwere to the Oath of Supremacie, but that hee giues the child a wrong name.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And now to come to a particular anſwere of his Letter. Firſt, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſweet memory hee hath of his old acquaintance with the Arch-prieſt; it may indeed be pleaſing for him to recount: but ſure I am, his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him and the reſt of his ſocietie, our Fugitiues (whereof he alſo vanteth himſelfe in his Preface to the Reader in his Booke of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies) hath prooued ſowre to vs and our State: For ſome of ſuch Prieſts and Ieſuits, as were the greateſt Traitors and fomenters of the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies againſt the late Queene, gaue vp Father <hi>Rob:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Campian</hi> and <hi>Hart.</hi> See the conference in the Tower.</note> Bellarmine</hi> for one of their greateſt authorities and oracles: And therfore I do not enuy the great honour he can winne, by his vaunt of his inward familiarity with an other Princes traitors &amp; fugitiues; whom vnto if he teach no better maners then hitherto he hath done, I thinke his fellowſhip are litle beholding vnto him.</p>
                  <p>And for deſiring him to remember him in his prayers at the Altar of the Lord: if the Arch-Prieſts prayers prooue no more profitable to his ſoule, then <hi>Bellarmines</hi> counſell is like to proue profitable, both to the ſoule and bodie of <hi>Blackwell</hi> (if he would follow it) the authour of this Letter might very well be without his prayers.</p>
                  <p>Now the firſt meſſenger that I can finde which brought ioyfull newes of the Arch-Prieſt to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> was hee that brought the newes of the Arch-Prieſts taking, and firſt appearance of Martyrdome. A great ſigne ſurely of the Cardinals mortification, that hee was ſo reioyced to heare of the apprehenſion, impriſonment and appearance of putting to death of ſo old and deare a friend of his. But yet apparantly he ſhould firſt haue beene
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:23110:156"/>ſure, that hee was onely to bee puniſhed for cauſe of Religion, before hee had ſo triumphed vpon the expectation of his Martyrdome. For firſt, by what rule of charitie was it lawfull for him to iudge mee a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals charitie.</note> before proofe had beene made of it by the ſaid Arch-Prieſts condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and death? What could hee know, that the ſaid Arch-Prieſt was not taken vpon ſuſpicion of his guiltineſſe in the Powder-Treaſon? What certaine information had hee then receiued vpon the particulars, whereupon hee was to bee accuſed? And laſt of all, by what inſpiration could he foretell whereupon hee was to bee accuſed? For at that time there was yet nothing layed to his charge. And if charitie ſhould not bee ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, what warrant had hee abſolutely to condemne mee of vſing perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and tyrannie, which could not bee but implyed vpon mee, if <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> was to bee a Martyr? But ſurely it may iuſtly be ſayd of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in this caſe, that our Sauiour CHRIST ſaith of all worldly and carnall men, who thinke it enough to loue their
<note n="1" place="margin">Mar. 5.43.</note> friends, and hate their enemies; the limits of the Cardinals charitie extending no farther, then to them of his owne profeſſion. For what euer hee added in ſuperfluous charitie to <hi>Blackwel,</hi> in reioycing in the ſpeculation of his future Martyrdome; hee detracted as much vniuſtly and vncharitably from me, in accounting of me thereby as of a bloody Perſecutour. And whereas this ioy of his was interrupted by the next meſſenger, that brought the newes of the ſaide Arch-Prieſt his failing in his conſtancie, by taking of this Oath; he needed neuer to haue beene troubled, either with his former ioy or his ſecond ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, both beeing alike falſly grounded. For as it was neuer my intention to lay any thing vnto the ſaid Arch-Prieſts charge, as I haue neuer done to any for cauſe of conſcience; ſo was <hi>Blackwels</hi> conſtancie neuer brangled by taking of this Oath; It beeing a thing which he euer thought lawfull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his apprehenſion, and whereunto hee perſwaded all Catholiques to giue obedience; like as after his apprehenſion, hee neuer made doubt or ſtop in it; but at the firſt offering it vnto him, did freely take it, as a thing moſt lawfull; neither meanes of threatening, or flatterie being euer vſed vnto him, as himſelfe can yet beare witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>And as for the temperature and modification of this Oath, except that a reaſonable and lawfull matter is there ſet downe in reaſonable and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate wordes, agreeing thereunto; I know not what he can meane, by quarelling it for that fault: For no temperatneſſe nor modifications in words therein, can iuſtly be called the Deuils craft; when the thing it ſelfe is ſo plaine, and ſo plainely interpreted to all them that take it; as the onely troubleſome thing in it all, bee the wordes vſed in the end thereof, for eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewing <hi>Aequiuocation</hi> and <hi>Mentall reſeruation.</hi> Which new Catholike do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, may farre iuſtlier bee called the Deuils craft, then any plaine and temperate wordes, in ſo plaine and cleare a matter. But what ſhall we ſay of theſe ſtrange countrey clownes, whom of with the <hi>Satyre</hi> we may iuſtly complaine, that they blow both hote &amp; cold out of one mouth? For <hi>Luther</hi>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:23110:156"/>and all our bold and free-ſpeaking Writers are mightily railed vpon by them, as hote-brained fellowes, and ſpeakers by the Deuils inſtinct: and now if we ſpeake moderately and temperately of them, it muſt be tearmed the Deuils craft: And therefore wee may iuſtly complaine with CHRIST, that when we
<note n="1" place="margin">Mat. 11.17.</note> mourne, they wil not lament: and when we pipe, they wil not dance. But neither <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> his ſeueritie, nor CHRIST his meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and lenitie can pleaſe them, who build but to their owne Monarchie vpon the ground of their owne Traditions; and not to CHRIST vpon the ground of his word and infallible trewth.</p>
                  <p>But what can bee meant by alleadging, that the craft of the Deuill herein, is onely vſed for ſubuerſion of the Catholique Faith, and euerſion of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Primacie; had neede bee commented anew by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe: For in all this Letter of his, neuer one word is vſed, to prooue that by any part of this Oath the Primacie of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is any way medled with, except Maſter <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his bare alleadging; which without proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it by more cleare demonſtration, can neuer ſatisfie the conſcience of any reaſonable man. For (for ought that I know) heauen and earth are no farther aſunder, then the profeſſion of a temporall obedience to a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall King, is different from any thing belonging to the Catholique Faith, or Supremacie of Saint <hi>Peter:</hi> For as for the Catholique Faith;
<note place="margin">No deciſion of any point of Religion in the Oath of Allegiance.</note> can there be one word found in all that Oath, tending or ſounding to matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? Doeth he that taketh it, promiſe there to beleeue, or not to beleeue any article of Religion? Or doeth hee ſo much as name a trew or falſe Church there? And as for Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Primacie; I know no Apoſtles name that is therein named, except the name of IAMES, it being my Chriſten name: though it pleaſe him not to deigne to name me in all the Letter; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, the contents thereof concerne mee in the higheſt degree. Neither is there any mention at all made therein, either <hi>diſertis verbis,</hi> or by any other indirect meanes, either of the Hierarchie of the Church, of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, of the Sea Apoſtolike, or of any ſuch matter: but that the Author of our Letter doeth brauely make mention of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſion, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it in compariſon with the ſucceſſion of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight. Of which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt and vnmannerly ſimilitude, I wonder he ſhould not be much aſhamed: For as to King <hi>Henries</hi> Succeſſour (which hee meaneth by mee) as I, I ſay, neuer did, nor will preſume to create any Article of Faith, or to bee Iudge thereof; but to ſubmit my exemplarie obedience vnto them, in as great humilitie as the meaneſt of the land: ſo if the Pope could bee as well able to prooue his either Perſonall or Doctrinall Succeſſion from Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> as I am able to prooue my lineall deſcent from the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> there had neuer beene ſo long adoe, nor ſo much ſturre kept about this queſtion in Chriſtendome; neither had

                  <p>But now wee come to his ſtrongeſt argument, which is, That he would alledge vpon mee a Panicke terrour, as if I were poſſeſſed with a needleſſe feare:
<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Argument.</note> 
                     <hi>For,</hi> ſaith the Cardinall, <hi>from the beginning of the Churches firſt infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, euen to this day, where was it euer heard, that euer a</hi> Pope <hi>either commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to bee killed, or allowed the ſlaughter of any Prince whatſoeuer, whether hee were an Hereticke, an Ethnicke, or Perſecutour?</hi> But firſt, wherefore doeth he here wilfully, and of purpoſe omit the reſt of the points mentioned in that Oath, for depoſing; degrading, ſtirring vp of armes, or rebelling againſt them, which are as well mentioned in that Oath, as the killing of them? as beeing all of one conſequence againſt a King, no Subiect beeing ſo ſcrupulous, as that hee will attempt the one, and leaue the other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performed if hee can. And yet ſurely I cannot blame him for paſſing it ouer, ſince he could not otherwiſe haue eſchewed the direct belying of himſelfe in tearmes, which hee now doeth but in ſubſtance and effect: For
<note n="1" place="margin">

                  <p>But to returne to the <hi>Popes</hi> allowing of killing of Kings, I know not with what face hee can ſet ſo ſtout a deniall vpon it againſt his owne knowledge. How many Emperours did the <hi>Pope</hi> raiſe warre againſt in their owne bowels? Who as they were ouercome in battaile, were ſubiect to haue beene killed therein, which I hope the <hi>Pope</hi> could not but haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, when he was ſo farre inraged at

                  <p>But ſure I am, if ſome Cardinals had not beene more wiſe and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in that errand, then the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe was, the <hi>Popes</hi> owne Kalender of his Saints would haue ſufficiently proued <hi>Bellarmin</hi> a lier in this caſe. And
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:23110:157"/>to draw yet neerer vnto our ſelues; how many practiſes and attempts were made againſt the late Queenes life, which were directly enioyned to thoſe Traitours by their Confeſſors, and plainly authorized by the <hi>Popes</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? For verification whereof, there needs no more proofe, then that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Pope</hi> either then or ſince, called any Church-man in queſtion for med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in any thoſe treaſonable conſpiracies; nay, the Cardinals owne S. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derus</hi> mentioned in his Letter, could well verifie this trewth, if hee were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue; and who will looke his bookes, will finde them filled with no other doctrine then this. And what difference there is betweene the killing, or allowing the ſlaughter of Kings, and the ſtirring vp and approbation of practiſes to kill them; I remit to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne iudgement. It may then very clearely appeare, how ſtrangely this Authors paſſion hath made him forget himſelfe, by implicating himſelfe in ſo ſtrong a contradiction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne knowledge and conſcience, againſt the witneſſe of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bookes, and againſt the practiſe of our owne times.

                  <p>Firſt, by the ſending foorth of theſe Bulles whereof I made mention al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, for debarring me from entrie vnto this Crowne, and Kingdome. And next after my entrie, and full poſſeſſion thereof, by the horrible Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-treaſon, which ſhould haue bereft both me and mine, both of crowne and life. And howſoeuer the Pope will ſeeme to cleare himſelfe of any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the ſaid Powder-treaſon, yet can it not be denied, that his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall miniſters here, and his chiefe <hi>Mancipia</hi> the Ieſuites, were the plaine
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:23110:159"/>practiſers thereof: for which the principall of them hath died confeſſing it, and other haue fled the Countrey for the crime; yea, ſome of them gone into <hi>Italy:</hi> and yet neither theſe that fled out of this Countrey for it, nor yet <hi>Baldwine,</hi> who though he then remained in the Low-countreys, was of counſell in it, were euer called to account for it by the Pope; much leſſe puniſhed for medling in ſo ſcandalous and enormous buſineſſe. And now what needs ſo great wonder and exclamation, that <hi>the only King of</hi> England <hi>feareth:</hi> And <hi>what other Chriſtian King doeth, or euer did feare but hee?</hi> As if by the force of his rhetoricke he could make me and my good Subiects to miſtruſt our ſenſes, deny the Sunne to ſhine at midday, and not with the ſerpent to ſtop our cares to his charming, but to the plaine and viſible ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie it ſelfe. And yet for all this wonder, he can neuer prooue mee to be troubled with ſuch a Panicke terrour. Haue I euer importuned the Pope with any requeſt for my ſecuritie? Or haue I either troubled other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes my friends and allies, to intreat for me at the Popes hand? Or yet haue I begged from them any aide or aſſiſtance for my farther ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie? No. All this wondred-at feare of mine, ſtretcheth no further, then wiſely to make diſtinction betweene the ſheepe and goats in my owne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. For ſince, what euer the Popes part hath beene in the Powder-trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; yet certaine it is, that all theſe caitife monſters did to their death main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that onely zeale of Religion mooued them to that horrible attempt: yea, ſome of them at their death, would not craue pardon at God or King for their offence; exhorting other of their followers to the like conſtancie. Had not wee then, and our Parliament great reaſon, by this Oath to ſet a marke of diſtinction betweene good Subiects, and bad? Yea, betweene Papiſts, though peraduenture zealous in their religion, yet otherwiſe ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilly honeſt and good Subiects, and ſuch terrible firebrands of hell, as would maintaine the like maximes, which theſe Powder-men did? Nay, could there be a more gracious part in a King, ſuppoſe I ſay it, towards Subiects of a contrary Religion, then by making them to take this Oath, to publiſh their honeſt fidelitie in temporal things to me their Soueraigne, and thereby to wipe off that imputation and great ſlander which was laide vpon the whole profeſſours of that Religion, by the furious enterpriſe of theſe Powder-men?</p>

But the greateſt diſſimilitude of all, is in this: that <hi>Iulian</hi> preſſed them to commit idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie to Idoles and Images: but as well I, as all the Subiects of my profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are ſo farre from guilt in this point, as wee are counted heretiques by you, becauſe we will not commit idolatrie. So as in the maine point of all, is the greateſt contrarietie. For, <hi>Iulian</hi> perſecuted the Chriſtians becauſe they would not commit idolatrie; and ye count me a perſecutour, becauſe I will not admit idolatrie: So as to conclude this point, this old ſentence may well be applied to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in vſing ſo vnapt a ſimilitude,</p>
                  <q>Perdere quos vult Iupiter, hos dementat.</q>
                  <p>And therefore his vncharitable concluſion doeth not rightly follow: <hi>That it ſeemeth vnto him, that ſome ſuch thing ſhould be ſubtilly or fraudulently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in this Oath;</hi> as if no man can deteſt Treaſon againſt the King, or profeſſe ciuill ſubiection, except hee renounce the Primacie of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique Sea. But how he hath ſuckt this apprehenſion out at his fingers ends, I cannot imagine: for ſure I am, as I haue oft ſaid, hee neuer goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prooue it: and to anſwere an improbable imagination, is to fight againſt a vaniſhing ſhadow. It cannot be denied indeed, that many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of CHRIST, as well Prieſts, as others, haue endured conſtantly all ſorts of torments, and death, for the profeſſion of CHRIST: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to all ſuch his examples, as hee bringeth in for verifying the ſame, I need not to giue him any other anſwere, ſaue onely to remember him, that he playeth the part of a ſophiſter in all theſe his examples of the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Martyrs; euer taking <hi>Controuerſum pro confeſſo,</hi> as if this our caſe were of the ſame nature.</p>
                  <p>But yet that the Reader may the better diſcouer, not onely how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aptly his ſimilitudes are applied, but likewiſe how diſhoneſtly hee vſeth himſelfe in all his citations: I haue thought good to ſet downe the very places themſelues cited by him, together with a ſhort deduction of the trew ſtate of thoſe particular caſes: whereby, how little theſe examples can touch our caſe; nay, by the contrary, how rightly their trew ſenſe may bee

                     </note> For as <hi>Eleazar</hi> was a principall Scribe, ſo is he a principall Prieſt: As <hi>Eleazars</hi> example had a great force in it, to animate the yonger Scribes to keepe the Lawe, or in his colourable eating it, to haue taught them to diſſemble: ſo hath the Arch-prieſts, either to make the inferiour Prieſts to take the Oath, or to refuſe it: but the ground failing, the building can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand: For what example is there in all the Scripture, in which diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Oath of the King, or want of Allegiance is allowed? If the Cardinall would remember, that when the Church maketh a Lawe (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to forbid fleſh on certaine dayes) he that refuſeth to obey it, incurreth the iuſt cenſure of the Church: If a man then ought to die rather then to breake the leaſt of Gods Ceremoniall Lawes, and to pine and ſtarue his body, rather then to violate the Church his poſitiue Law: will he not giue leaue to a man to redeeme his ſoule from ſinne, and to keepe his body from puniſhment, by keeping a Kings politike Law, and by giuing good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in his Perſon, raiſe vp a good opinion in me of like Allegiance in the inferiour of his order? This application, as I take it, would haue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fitted this example.</p>

                  <p>Now indeed for one word of his in the middeſt of his examples, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but greatly commend him; that is, that Martyrs ought to endure all ſorts of tortures and death, before they ſuffer one ſyllable to be corrupted of the Law of God.

                  <p>And as for <hi>Roffenſis</hi> his fellow Martyr (who could haue bene content to haue taken the Oath of the Kings Supremacie, with a certaine modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which <hi>Moore</hi> refuſed) as his impriſonment was neither onely, nor principally for the cauſe of Supremacie, ſo died hee but a halting and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Martyr or witneſſe for that moſt weighty head of doctrine; the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> going at that time, in one current and ſtreame as it were againſt him in that Argument, diuers of them being of farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reputation for learning and ſound iudgement, then euer he was. So as in this point we may well arme our ſelues with the Cardinals owne reaſon, where he giueth amongſt other notes of the trew Church, <hi>Vniuerſalitie</hi> for one, wee hauing the generall and Catholique concluſion of the whole Church of <hi>England,</hi> on our ſide in this caſe, as appeareth by their booke ſet out by the whole Conuocation of <hi>England,</hi> called, <hi>The Institution of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man;</hi> the ſame matter being likewiſe very learnedly handled by diuers particular learned men of our Church, as by <hi>Steuen Gardiner</hi> in his booke <hi>De vera obedientia,</hi> with a Preface of Biſhop <hi>Boners</hi> adioyning to it, <hi>De ſummo &amp; abſoluto Regis Imperio,</hi> publiſhed by M. <hi>Bekinſaw, De vera differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Regiae Potestatis &amp; Eccleſiasticae,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Tonſtals</hi> Sermon, Biſhop <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Sermon, the letter of <hi>Tonstall</hi> to Cardinall <hi>Poole,</hi> and diuers other both in Engliſh and Latine. And if the bitterneſſe of <hi>Fiſhers</hi> diſcontentment had not bene fed with his dayly ambitious expectation of the Cardinals hat, which came ſo neere as <hi>Calis</hi> before he loſt his head to fill it with, I haue great reaſon to doubt, if he would haue conſtantly perſeuered in induring his Martyrdome for that one moſt waighty head of doctrine.</p>
                  <p>And ſurely theſe two Captaines and ringleaders to Martyrdome were but ill followed by the reſt of their countreymen: for I can neuer reade of any after them, being of any great accompt, and that not many, that euer ſealed that weighty head of doctrine with their blood in <hi>England.</hi> So as the trew cauſes of their firſt falling in trouble (whereof I haue already made mention) being rightly conſidered vpon the one part, and vpon the other the ſcant number of witneſſes, that with their blood ſealed it, (a point ſo greatly accompted of by our Cardinal) there can but ſmal glory redound thereby to our Engliſh nation, theſe onely two, <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> ſeruing for witneſſes againſt our Antichriſtian doctrine.</p>
                  <p>And I am ſure the Supremacie of Kings may,

                  <p>Theſe contrarieties betweene the Booke of God, and <hi>Bellarmines</hi> bookes, haue I heere ſet in oppoſition each to other, <hi>Vt ex contrariis iuxta ſe poſitis, veritas magis eluceſcere poſsit.</hi> And thus farre I dare boldly affirme, that whoſoeuer will indifferently weigh theſe irreconciliable contradictions here ſet downe, will eaſily confeſſe, that CHRIST is no more contrarie to Belial, light to darkneſſe, and heauen to hell, then <hi>Bellarmines</hi> eſtimation of Kings, is to Gods.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the concluſion of his letter, which is onely filled with ſtrong and pithie exhortations, to perſwade and confirme <hi>Blackwell</hi> to the patient and conſtant induring of martyrdome, I haue nothing to anſwere, ſaue by way of regrate; that ſo many good ſentences drawen out of the Scripture, ſo well and ſo handſomely packed vp together, ſhould be ſo ill and vntrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied: But an euill cauſe is neuer the better for ſo good a cloake; and an ill matter neuer amended by good wordes: And therefore I may iuſtly turne ouer that craft of the diuell vpon himſelfe, in vſing ſo holy-like an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to ſo euill a purpoſe. Onely I could haue wiſhed him, that hee
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:23110:165"/>had a little better obſerued his <hi>decorum</hi> herein, in not letting ſlippe two or three prophane words amongſt ſo many godly mortified Scripture ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For in all the Scripture, eſpecially in the New Teſtament, I neuer read of <hi>Pontifex Maximus.</hi> And the Pope muſt be content in that ſtyle to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to the Law and inſtitution of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> and not to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> who neuer heard nor dreamed of ſuch an Office.</p>
                  <p>And for his <hi>Caput fidei,</hi> which I remembred before, the Apoſtles (I am ſure) neuer gaue that ſtyle to any, but to CHRIST: So as theſe ſtyles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome were neuer found in Scripture, and ſome were neuer applyed but to CHRIST in that ſenſe, as hee applieth it, had beene better to haue beene left out of ſo holy and mortified a letter.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then this preſent Diſcourſe, I heartily wiſh all indifferent readers of the <hi>Breues</hi> and Letter, not to iudge by the ſpeciouſneſſe of the wordes, but by the weight of the matter; not looking to that which is ſtrongly alledged, but iudiciouſly to conſider what is iuſtly prooued. And for all my owne good and naturall Subiects, that their hearts may remaine eſtabliſhed in the trewth; that theſe forraine inticements may not ſeduce them from their natall and naturall duetie; and that all, aſwell ſtrangers, as naturall ſubiects, to whoſe eyes this Diſcourſe ſhall come, may wiſely and vnpartially iudge of the Veritie, as it is nakedly here ſet downe, for clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe miſts and cloudes of calumnies, which were iniuſtly heaped vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; for which end onely I heartily pray the courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be perſwaded, that I tooke occaſion to publiſh this Diſcourſe.</p>

            <p>To you, I ſay, as of right belongeth, doe I conſecrate and direct this Warning of mine, or rather <hi>Preamble</hi> to my reprinted <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie for the Oath of Allegiance:</hi> For the cauſe is generall, and concerneth the Authoritie and priuiledge of Kings in generall, and all ſupereminent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall powers. And if in whatſoeuer Societie, or Corporation of men, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Corporations of Cities, or in the Corporation of any mechanicke craft or handie-worke, euery man is carefull to maintaine the priuiledges of that Societie whereunto he is ſworne; nay, they will rather cluſter all in one, making it a common cauſe, expoſing themſelues to all ſorts of perill, then ſuffer the leaſt breach in their Liberties; If thoſe of the baſer ſort of people, I ſay, be ſo curious and zealous for the preſeruation of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon priuiledges and liberties, as if the meaneſt amongſt them be touched in any ſuch point, they thinke it concerneth them all: Then what ſhould wee doe in ſuch a caſe, whom GOD hath placed in the higheſt thrones vpon earth, made his Lieutenants and Vice-gerents, and euen ſeated vs vpon his owne Throne to execute his Iudgements? The conſideration hereof hath now mooued mee to expone a Caſe vnto you, which doeth not ſo neerely touch mee in my particular, as it doeth open a breach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Authoritie, (I ſpeake in the plurall of all Kings) and priuiledge in generall. And ſince not onely all rankes and ſorts of people in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe inuiolably obſerue this <hi>Maxime,</hi> but euen the Ciuil Law, by which the greateſt part of Chriſtendome is gouerned, doeth giue them an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, <hi>qui fouent conſimilem cauſam;</hi> How much more then haue yee intereſt in this cauſe, not beeing <hi>ſimilis</hi> or <hi>par cauſa</hi> to yours, but <hi>eadem</hi> with yours?
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:23110:167"/>and indeed yee all <hi>fouetis,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>fouere debetis eandem cauſam mecum.</hi> And ſince this cauſe is common to vs all; both the Ciuill Lawes, and the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipall Lawes of all Nations, permit and warne them, that haue a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt, to concurre in one for the defence of their common cauſe; yea, common ſenſe teacheth vs with the Poet, <hi>Ecquid</hi>

            <p>A wake then while it is time, and ſuffer not, by your longer ſleepe, the ſtrings of your Authoritie to be cut <hi>in ſingulis,</hi> and one and one to your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ruine, which by your vnited forces, would rather make a ſtrong rope for the enemie to hang himſelfe in, with <hi>Achitophel,</hi> then that hee ſhould euer bee able to breake it. As for this <hi>Apologie</hi> of mine, it is trew, that I thought good to ſet it firſt out without putting my name vnto it; but neuer ſo, as I thought to denie it, remembring well mine owne words, but taken out of the Scripture, in the beginning of the Preface to the Reader, in my <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that nothing is ſo bid, which ſhall not bee opened, &amp;c.</hi> promiſing there, which with GOD his grace I ſhall euer performe, neuer to doe that in ſecret, which I ſhall need to be aſhamed of, when it ſhall come to be proclaimed in publique.</p>
            <p>In deed I thought it fit, for two reſpects, that this my <hi>Apologie</hi> ſhould firſt viſite the world without hauing my name written in the forehead thereof. Firſt becauſe of the <hi>matter,</hi> and next of the <hi>perſons</hi> that I medled with. The <hi>matter,</hi> it being a <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> which I was to write, conteining reaſons and diſcourſes in <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> for the defence of the <hi>Oath of Alleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> and refutation of the condemners thereof; I thought it not comely for one of my place, to put my name to bookes concerning Scholaſticke <hi>Disputations;</hi> whoſe calling is to ſet forth <hi>Decrees</hi> in the Imperatiue mood: for I thinke my ſelfe as good a man as the Pope, by his reuerence, for whom theſe my <hi>Anſwerers</hi> make the like excuſe; for that his <hi>Breues</hi> are ſo ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary without yeelding any reaſon vnto them. My next reaſon was the reſpect of the <hi>perſons</hi> whom with I medled. Wherein, although I ſhortly anſwered the Popes <hi>Breues;</hi> yet the point I moſt laboured, being the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Letter, I was neuer the man, I confeſſe, that could thinke a <hi>Cardinall</hi> a meet match for a <hi>King:</hi> eſpecially, hauing many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth thouſands of my ſubiects of as good birth as hee. As for his Church dignitie, his <hi>Cardinalſhip</hi> I meane, I know not how to ranke or value it, either by the warrant of God his word, or by the ordinance of <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> or <hi>Kings,</hi> it being indeed onely a new <hi>Papall</hi> erection, tolerated by the ſleeping conniuence of our <hi>Predeceſſours</hi> (I meane ſtill by the plurall of <hi>Kings</hi>) But notwithſtanding of this my forbearing to put my name vnto it, ſome <hi>Embaſſadours</hi> of ſome of you (my louing <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> and <hi>Couſins</hi>) whome this cauſe did neerelieſt concerne, can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that I made Preſents of ſome of thoſe bookes, at their firſt printing, vnto them, and that auowedly in my owne name. As alſo the Engliſh
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:23110:167"/>
               <hi>Paragraphist,</hi> or rather peruerſe Pamphleter <hi>Parſons,</hi> ſince all his deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt runne vpon a <hi>P.</hi> hath trewly obſerued, that my Armes are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed in the frontiſpice thereof, which vſeth not to bee in bookes of other mens doing; whereby his malice in pretending his ignorane, that hee might pay mee the ſoundlier, is the more inexcuſable. But now that I finde my ſparing to put my name vnto it hath not procured my ſparing by theſe anſwerers, who haue neither ſpared my Perſon directly in naming me, nor indirectly by railing vpon the Author of the Booke: it is now high time for me no longer to conceale nor diſauow my ſelfe, as if I were aſhamed of my owne deed. And therefore that ye may the better vnderſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the cauſe, I will begin at the firſt ground thereof.</p>
            <p>The neuer enough wondered at and abhorred POVVDER-TREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON (though the repetition thereof grieueth, I know, the gentle hearted Ieſuite <hi>Parſons</hi>) this Treaſon, I ſay, being not onely intended a gainſt mee and my Poſteritie, but euen againſt the whole houſe of Parliament, plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely by Papiſts, and they onely led thereto by a prepoſterous zeale for the aduancement of their Religion; ſome of them continuing ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that euen at their death they would not acknowledge their fault; but in their laſt words, immediatly before the expiring of their breath, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to condemne themſelues and craue pardon for their deed, except the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church ſhould firſt condemne it; And ſoone after, it being diſcouered, that a great number of my Popiſh Subiects of all rankes and ſexes, both men and women, as well within as without the Countrey; had a confuſed notion and an obſcure knowledge, that ſome great thing was to bee done in that Parliament for the weale of the Church; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, for ſecrecies cauſe, they were not acquainted with the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; certaine formes of prayer hauing likewiſe beene ſet downe and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for the good ſucceſſe of that great errand; adding heereunto, that diuers times, and from diuers Prieſtes, the Archtraitours themſelues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Sacrament for confirmation of their heart, and obſeruation of ſecrecie; Some of the principall Ieſuites likewiſe being found guiltie of the foreknowledge of the Treaſon it ſelfe; of which number ſome fled from their triall, others were apprehended (as holy <hi>Garnet</hi> himſelfe and <hi>Owldcorne</hi> were) and iuſtly executed vpon their owne plaine confeſſion of their guilt: If this Treaſon now, clad with theſe circumſtances, did not miniſter a iuſt occaſion to that Parliament houſe, whome they thought to haue deſtroyed, courageouſly and zealouſly at their next ſitting downe, to vſe all meanes of triall, whether any more of that minde were yet left in the Countrey; I leaue it to you to iudge, whom God hath appointed his higheſt Depute Iudges vpon earth: And amongſt other things for this purpoſe, This <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> ſo vniuſtly impugned, was then deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and enacted. And in caſe any ſharper Lawes were then made againſt the Papiſts, that were not obedient to the former Lawes of the Countrey; if ye will conſider the <hi>Time, Place</hi> and <hi>Perſons,</hi> it will be thought no wonder,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:23110:168"/>ſeeing that occaſion did ſo iuſtly exaſperate them to make ſeuerer Lawes, then otherwiſe they would haue done. The <hi>Time,</hi> I ſay, being the very next ſitting downe of the Parliament, after the diſcouerie of that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Treaſon: the <hi>Place</hi> being the ſame, where they ſhould all haue bene blowne vp, and ſo bringing it freſhly to their memorie againe: the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> being the very Parliament men whom they thought to haue deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And yet ſo farre hath both my heart and gouernment bene from any bitternes, as almoſt neuer one of thoſe ſharpe additions to the former Lawes haue euer yet bene put in execution.</p>
            <p>And that ye may yet know further, for the more conuincing theſe Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of wilfull malice, who impudently affirme, That this <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> was deuiſed for deceiuing and intrapping of Papiſts in points of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; The trewth is, that the Lower houſe of Parliament at the firſt fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of this Oath, made it to containe, That the Pope had no power to excommunicate me, which I cauſed them to reforme, onely making it to conclude, That no excommunication of the Popes, can warrant my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to practiſe againſt my Perſon or State; denying the depoſition of Kings to be in the Popes lawfull power; as indeed I take any ſuch tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall violence, to be farre without the limits of ſuch a Spirituall cenſure as Excommunication is. So carefull was I that nothing ſhould be contained in this Oath, except the profeſſion of natural Allegiance, and ciuil and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall obedience, with a promiſe to reſiſt to all contrary vnciuill violence.</p>
            <p>This Oath now grounded vpon ſo great and iuſt an occaſion, ſet forth in ſo reaſonable termes, and ordained onely for making of a trew diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betweene Papiſts of quiet diſpoſition, and in all other things good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and ſuch other Papiſts as in their hearts maintained the like violent bloody <hi>Maximes,</hi> that the Powder-Traitours did: This Oath, I ſay, being publiſhed and put in practiſe, bred ſuch euill blood in the Popes head and his Cleargie, as <hi>Breue</hi> after <hi>Breue</hi> commeth forth, <hi>vt vndam vnda ſequitur;</hi> prohibiting all Catholikes from taking the ſame, as a thing cleane contrary to the Catholike faith; and that the taking thereof cannot ſtand with the ſaluation of their ſoules.</p>
            <p>There commeth likewiſe a letter of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> to <hi>Blackwell</hi> to the ſame purpoſe; but diſcourſing more at length vpon the ſaid Oath. Whereupon, after I had entred in conſideration of their vniuſt impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that ſo iuſt and lawfull an Oath; and fearing that by their vntrew calumnies and Sophiſtrie the hearts of a number of the moſt ſimple and ignorant of my people ſhould bee miſſe-led, vnder that faire and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cloake of Conſcience; I thought good to ſet foorth an <hi>Apologie</hi> for the ſaid Oath: wherein I prooued, that as this Oath contained nothing but matter of ciuill and temporall Obedience, due by Subiects to their Soueraigne Prince; ſo this quarrelling therewith was nothing but a late vſurpation of Popes (againſt the warrant of all Scriptures, ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and Fathers) vpon the Temporall power of Kings, wherewith onely
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:23110:168"/>my <hi>Apologie</hi> doeth meddle. But the publiſhing of this Booke of mine hath brought ſuch two Anſwerers, or rather Railers vpon mee, as all the world may wonder at: For my Booke being firſt written in Engliſh, an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Oath being the ſubiect thereof, and the vſe of it properly belonging to my Subiects of <hi>England;</hi> and immediatly thereafter being tranſlated into Latine, vpon a deſire that ſome had of further publiſhing it abroad; it commeth home to mee now anſwered in both the Languages. And, I thinke, if it had bene ſet foorth in all the tongues that were at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> it would haue bene returned anſwered in them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Thus may a man ſee how buſie a Biſhop the Diuell is, and how hee omitteth no diligence for venting of his poyſoned wares. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their malice doeth clearely appeare, that they pay mee ſo quickly with a double anſwere; and yet haue neuer anſwered their owne Arch-prieſt, who hath written a booke for the maintenance of the ſame Oath, and of the temporall authoritie of Kings, alledging a cloud of their owne Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men againſt them.</p>
            <p>As for the Engliſh <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> my vnnaturall and fugitiue Subiect; I will neither defile my pen, nor your ſacred eyes or eares with the deſcribing of him, who aſhames, nay, abhorres not to raile, nay, to rage and ſpew foorth blaſphemies againſt the late Queene of famous memory. A Subiect to raile againſt his naturall Soueraigne by birth; A man to raile againſt a Lady by ſexe; A holy man (in outward profeſſion) to inſult vpon the dead; nay to take <hi>Radamanthus</hi> office ouer his head, and to ſit downe and play the Iudge in hell, And all his quarrell is, that either her Succeſſour, or any of her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants ſhould ſpeake honourably of her. Curſed be he that curſeth the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed of God: and deſtroyed mought he be with the deſtruction of <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> that hath ſinned in the contradiction of <hi>Korah.</hi> Without mought ſuch dogs and ſwine be caſt forth, I ſay, out of the Spirituall <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for my Latine <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> I haue nothing to ſay to his perſon; hee is not my Subiect; hee ſtandeth or falleth vnto his owne Lord: But ſure I am, they two haue caſten lotts vpon my Booke, ſince they could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide it: the one of them, my fugitiue, to raile vpon my late Predeceſſour, (but a rope is the fitteſt anſwere for ſuch an Hiſtorian;) the other, a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thinketh he may be boldeſt both to pay my perſon and my Booke, as indeed he doeth; which how iuſtly either in matter or maner, wee are now to examine.</p>
            <p>But firſt, who ſhould be the trew Authour of this booke, I can but gueſſe. Hee calleth himſelfe <hi>Mattheus Tortus,</hi> Cardinall <hi>Bellarmins</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine. A

But who will conſider the carriage of the whole booke, ſhall finde that hee writeth with ſuch authoritie, or at the leaſt <hi>tam elato ſtylo,</hi>
               <pb n="294" facs="tcp:23110:169"/>ſo little ſparing either Kings in generall, or my perſon in particular; and with ſuch a greatneſſe,

               <hi>Decernimus:</hi> as it ſhall appeare, or at leaſt bee very probable, that it is the Maſters, and not the mans labour; eſpecially in one place, where hee quarrelleth mee for caſting vp his <hi>moralis certitudo</hi> and <hi>pie credi</hi> vnto him;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 69.</note> hee there groſſely forgetting himſelfe, ſaith, <hi>malâ fide nobiſcum agit,</hi> thereby making this Authour to be one perſon with <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> But let it bee the worke of a <hi>Tortus</hi> indeed, and not of a perſonated Cardinall; yet muſt it bee the Cardinals deed, ſince Maſter <hi>Tortus</hi> is the Cardinals man, and doeth it in his Maſters defence. The errand then being the Cardinals, and done by his owne man, it cannot but bee accounted as his owne deed; eſpecially ſince the Engliſh Anſwerer doeth foure times promiſe, that <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or one by his appointment, ſhall ſufficiently anſwere it.</p>
            <p>And now to come to his matter and maner of Anſwere: Surely if there were no more but his vnmanerly maner, it is enough to diſgrace the whole matter thereof. For firſt, to ſhew his pride, in his Printers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the <hi>Politan</hi> edition of this <hi>elegans libellus,</hi> hee muſt equall the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals greatneſſe with mine in euery thing. For though hee confeſſeth this Maſter <hi>Tortus</hi> to bee an obſcure man; yet being the Cardinals Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leine, he is ſufficient enough forſooth to anſwere an Engliſh booke, that lacketh the name of an Authour; as if a perſonated obſcure name for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of a Cardinals booke, were a meete match for anſwering a KINGS Booke, that lacketh the name of an Authour; and a Cardinals Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leine to meete with the Deane of the Kings Chappell, whom <hi>Parſons</hi> with the Cardinall, haue (as it ſeemeth) agreed vpon to intitle to bee the Authour of my <hi>Apologie.</hi> And not onely in the Preface, but alſo through the whole booke doeth hee keepe this comparatiue greatneſſe. Hee muſt bee as ſhort in his anſwere, as I am in my Booke, hee muſt refute all that I haue ſaid againſt the Popes ſecond <hi>Breue,</hi> with equall breuitie, and vpon one page almoſt, as I haue done mine: and becauſe I haue ſet downe the ſubſtance of the Oath in foureteene Articles; in iuſt as many Articles muſt he ſet downe that Acte of Parliament of mine, wherein the Oath is contained: And yet, had hee contented himſelfe with his owne pride, by the demonſtration of his owne greatneſſe, without further wronging of mee, it had bene the more tollerable. But what cauſe gaue I him to farce his whole booke with iniuries, both againſt my Perſon and Booke? For whereas in all my <hi>Apologie</hi> I haue neuer giuen him a foule word, and eſpecially neuer gaue him the Lye: hee by the contrary giueth mee nine times the Lye in expreſſe termes, and ſeuen times chargeth mee with falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, which phraſe is equiualent with a Lye. And as for all other wordes of reproch, as <hi>nugae, conuitia, temeritas, vanitas, impudentia, blasphemiae, ſermonis barbaries, cum eadem foelicitate ſcribendi, cauillationes, applicatio inepta, fingere historias, audacia quae in hominem ſanae mentis cadere non

<note place="margin">Pag. 47.</note> that <hi>Pope</hi> Clement <hi>thought mee to bee inclined to their Religion:</hi> Sometimes, that I <hi>was a Puritane in Scotland,
<note place="margin">Pag. 98.</note> and a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutour of Protestants.</hi> In one place hee concludeth,
<note place="margin">Pag. 87.</note> 
               <hi>Quia Iacobus non eſt Catholicus, hoc ipſo Haereticus eſt.</hi> In another place,
<note place="margin">Pag. 98.</note> 
               <hi>Ex Chriſtiano Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistam fecerunt.</hi> In another place hee ſayeth, <hi>Neque omnino verum eſt,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Iacobum nunquam deſeruiſſe Religionem quam primò ſuſceperat.</hi> And in another place, after that hee hath compared and ranked mee with <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> the Apoſtate, hee concludeth, <hi>Cùm Catholicus not ſit,
<note place="margin">Pag. 97.</note> neque Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus eſt.</hi> If this now bee mannerly dealing with a King, I leaue it to you to iudge, who cannot but reſent ſuch indignities done to one of your qualitie.</p>
            <p>And as for the Matter of his Booke, it well fittes indeede the Manner thereof: for hee neuer anſwereth directly to the maine queſtion in my Booke. For whereas my <hi>Apologie</hi> handleth onely two points, as I told you before; One, to prooue that the <hi>Oath of Allegiance</hi> doeth onely meddle with the ciuill and temporall Obedience, due by Subiects to their naturall So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignes: The other, that this late vſurpation of Popes ouer the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power of Princes, is againſt the rule of all Scriptures, auncient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and Fathers: hee neuer improoues the firſt, but by a falſe inference; that the Oath denyeth the Popes power of Excommunication directly, ſince it denieth his authoritie in depoſing of Kings. And for the ſecond point, he bringeth no proofe to the contrary, but, <hi>Paſce oues meas:</hi> and, <hi>Tibi dabo claues regni Coelorum:</hi> and, That no Catholike euer doubted of it. So as I may trewly ſay of him, that hee either vnderſtandeth not, or at leaſt will not ſeeme to vnderſtand my Booke, in neuer directly anſwering the maine queſtion, as I haue alreadie ſaide; and ſo may I iuſtly turne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vpon himſelfe that doome of ignorance, which in the beginning of his Booke hee raſhly pronounceth vpon mee; ſaying, that I neither vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Popes <hi>Breues,</hi> his <hi>Letter,</hi> nor the Oath it ſelfe: And as hee deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to repeate ouer and ouer, I know not how oft, and triumpheth in this wrong inference of his; That to deny the Popes power to depoſe Kings, is to denie the Popes Primacie, and his ſpirituall power of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: So doeth hee, vpon that ground of <hi>Paſce oues meas,</hi> giue the Pope ſo ample a power ouer Kings, to throne or dethrone them at his pleaſure (and yet onely ſubiecting Chriſtian Kings to that ſlauerie) as I doubt not but in your owne Honours yee will reſent you of ſuch indignities; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſince it concernes ſo many of you as profeſſe the Romiſh religion, farre
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:23110:170"/>more then me: For ſince he accounteth me an heretike, and like <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtate; I am conſequently <hi>extra caulam,</hi> and none of the Popes flocke, and ſo am in the caſe of Ethnicke Princes, ouer whom he confeſſeth the Pope hath no power. But yee are in the Popes folde; and you, that great Paſtour may leade as ſheepe to the ſlaughter, when it ſhall pleaſe him. And as the Aſſes eares muſt be hornes, if the Lion liſt ſo to interprete it; ſo muſt yee be remooued as ſcabbed ſheepe from the flocke, if ſo the Pope thinke you to be, though your skinne be indeed neuer ſo ſound.</p>
            <p>Thus hath he ſet ſuch a new goodly interpretation vpon the wordes of CHRIST, <hi>Paſce, oues meas,</hi> as if it were as much to ſay, as, depoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings; and that <hi>Quodcunque ſolueris</hi> gaue the Pope power to diſpenſe with all ſorts of Oathes, Vowes, Penalties, Cenſures and Lawes, euen with the naturall obedience of Subiects to their Souereigne Lords; much like to that new coyned gloſſe that his brother
<note n="1" place="margin">Senten. Card. Baron. ſuper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. Venet.</note> 
               <hi>Baronius</hi> made vpon the wordes in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> viſion, <hi>Surge Petre, occide &amp; manduca;</hi> That is (ſaid he to the Pope) Goe kill and confound the <hi>Venetians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe I haue in my Booke (by citing a place in his controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies) diſcouered him to be a ſmall friend to Kings, he is much commoued: For whereas in his ſaid Controuerſies,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib. de Cler. cap.</hi> 28.</note> ſpeaking <hi>de Clericis,</hi> he is ſo bolde as to affirme, that Church-men are exempted from the power of earthly Kings; and that they ought them no ſubiection euen in temporall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but onely <hi>vi rationis</hi> and in their owne diſcretion, for the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of peace and good order, becauſe, I ſay, citing this place of his in my Booke, I tell with admiration, that hee freeth all Church-men from any ſubiection to Kings, euen thoſe that are their borne Subiects: hee is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with this phraſe, and ſayth it is an addition for breeding enuie vnto him, and raiſing of hatred againſt him: For, ſayth hee, although <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> affirmed generally, that Church-men were not ſubiect to earthly Kings; yet did hee not inſert that particular clauſe <hi>[though they were borne and dwelling in their Dominions]</hi> as if the words of Church-men and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kings in generall imported not as much: for Layickes as well as Church-men are ſubiect to none but to their naturall Soueraigne: And yet doeth hee not ſticke to confeſſe, that he meant it, though it was not fit (he ſayth) to be expreſſed.</p>
            <p>And thus quarrels hee me for reuealing his Printed ſecret. But whoſe hatred did hee feare in this? was it not yours? Who haue intereſt, but KINGS, in withdrawing of due ſubiection from KINGS? And when the greateſt Monarches amongſt you will remember, that almoſt the third part of your Subiects and of your Territories, is Church-men, and Church-liuings; I hope, yee will then conſider and weigh, what a feather hee pulles out of your wings, when hee denudeth you of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Subiects and their poſſeſſions, in the Popes fauour: nay, what briars and thornes are left within the heart of your dominions, when ſo popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and potent a partie ſhall haue their birth, education and liuelihood in
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:23110:170"/>your Countries, and yet owe you no ſubiection, nor acknowledge you for their SOVERAIGNES? So as where the Church-men of old were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their tythe of euery mans goods; the Pope now will haue little leſſe then the third part of euery Kings <hi>Subiects</hi> and <hi>Dominions.</hi> And as in this place, ſo throughout all the reſt of his booke, hee doeth nothing but amplifie the Popes power ouer Kings, and exaggerate my vnreaſonable rigour for preſſing this Oath; which hee will needs haue to bee nothing but a renewed Oath of <hi>Supremacie</hi> in more ſubtill and craftie termes, onely to robbe the Pope of his <hi>Primacie</hi> and ſpirituall power: making his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall power and authoritie ouer Princes, to be one of the chiefe Articles of the Catholike Faith.</p>
            <p>But that it may the better appeare vnto you, that all my labour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in this errand, was onely to meddle with that due temporall Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which my Subiects owe vnto mee; and not to intrap or inthrall their Conſciences, as hee moſt falſely affirmes: Yee ſhall firſt ſee how farre other Godly and Chriſtian <hi>Emperours</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> were from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the Popes temporall <hi>Supremacie</hi> ouer them; nay, haue crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, controlled and depoſed Popes: and next, what a number of my <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors</hi> in this Kingdome haue at all occaſions, euen in the times of the greateſt Greatneſſe of Popes, reſiſted and plainely withſtood them in this point.</p>
            <p>And firſt, all Chriſtian <hi>Emperours</hi> were for a long time ſo farre from acknowledging the Popes Superioritie ouer them, as by the contrary the Popes acknowledged themſelues for their <hi>Vaſsals,</hi> reuerencing and obeying the <hi>Emperours</hi> as their <hi>Lords,</hi> for proofe whereof, I remit you to my <hi>Apologie.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Lewes</hi> the ninth, ſurnamed <hi>Sanctus,</hi> had by a publique inſtrument (called <hi>Pragmatica ſanctio</hi>) forbidden all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of the Popes Court within his Realme: Pope <hi>Pius</hi>
               <note n="6" place="margin">Ioan. Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius. lib. de Sciſmat &amp; Concil.</note> the ſecond, in the beginning of <hi>Lewes</hi> the eleuenth his time, greatly miſſeliking this Decree ſo long before made, ſent his Legate to the ſaide King <hi>Lewes,</hi> with Letters-patents, vrging his promiſe which hee had made when hee was Dolphin of France, to repeale that Sanction if euer hee came to bee King. The King referreth the Legate ouer with his Letters-patents to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Paris: where the matter being propounded, was impugned by <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes Romanus,</hi> the Kings Atturney; with whoſe opinion the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of Paris concurring, an Appeale was made from the attempts of the Pope to the next generall Councell; the Cardinall departing with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation.</p>
            <p>But that the King of France and Church thereof haue euer ſtoken to their <hi>Gallican</hi> immunitie, in denying the Pope any Temporall power ouer them, and in reſiſting the Popes as oft as euer they preſt to meddle with their Temporall power, euen in the donation of Benefices; the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories are ſo full of them, as the onely examples thereof would make vp a bigge Volume by it ſelfe. And ſo farre were the <hi>Sorbonistes</hi> for the Kings and French Churches priuiledge in this point, as they were wont to maintaine; That if the Pope fell a quarrelling the King for that cauſe,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:23110:171"/>the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church might elect a <hi>Patriarch</hi> of their owne, renouncing any obedience to the Pope. And <hi>Gerſon</hi> was ſo farre from giuing the Pope that temporall authority ouer Kings (who otherwiſe was a deuoute <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholike) as hee wrote a Booke <hi>de Auferibilitate Papae;</hi> not onely from the power ouer Kings, but euen ouer the Church.</p>
            <p>And now pretermitting all further examples of forraigne Kings actions, I will onely content me at this time with ſome of my owne Predeceſſors examples of this kingdome of England; that it may thereby the more clearely appeare, that euen in thoſe times when the world was fulleſt of darkened blindnes and ignorance, the Kings of England haue oftentimes, not onely repined, but euen ſtrongly reſiſted and withſtood this temporall vſurpation and encrochment of ambitious Popes.</p>
            <p>And I will firſt begin at

               <hi>Calixtus</hi> held a Councell at RHEMES, whither King <hi>Henry</hi> had appointed certaine Biſhops of ENGLAND and NORMAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIE to goe; <hi>Thurſtan</hi> alſo, elected Archbiſhop of YORKE, got leaue of the King to goe thither, giuing his faith that hee would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Conſecration of the Pope; And comming to the Synode, by his liberall gifts (as the faſhion is) wanne the ROMANES fauour, and by their meanes obtained to bee conſecrated at the Popes hand: Which aſſoone as the King of ENGLAND knewe, hee forbade him to come within his Dominions.</p>
            <p>Moreouer King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt prohibited the <hi>Abbot</hi> of
<note n="4" place="margin">Ex Archiuis Regni.</note> 
               <hi>Waltham</hi> and <hi>Deane</hi> of <hi>Pauls,</hi> to collect a tenth of euery mans goods for a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the holy Land, which the Pope by three <hi>Bulles</hi> had committed to their charge; and the ſaid Deane of <hi>Pauls</hi> compeering before the King and his <hi>Councell,</hi> promiſed for the reuerence he did beare vnto the King, not to meddle any more in that matter, without the Kings good leaue and permiſſion. Here (I hope) a Church-man diſobeyed the <hi>Pope</hi> for obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his <hi>Prince</hi> euen in Church matters: but this new <hi>Ieſuited</hi> Diuinitie was not then knowen in the world.</p>
            <p>The ſame <hi>Edward I.</hi> impleaded the Deane of the Chappell of <hi>Vuluer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton,</hi> becauſe the ſaid Deane had, againſt the priuiledges of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, giuen a Prebend of the ſame Chappell to one at the Popes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: whereupon the ſaid Deane compeered, and put himſelfe in the Kings will for his offence.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Edward I.</hi> depriued alſo the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Durham</hi> of all his liberties, for diſobeying a prohibition of the Kings. So as it appeareth, the Kings
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:23110:172"/>in thoſe dayes thought the Church-men their <hi>Subiects,</hi> though now we be taught other Seraphicall doctrine.</p>
            <p>For further proofe whereof <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Ibſtocke</hi> was committed to the goale by the ſayde King, for hauing a ſuite in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſeuen yeeres for the Rectorie of <hi>Newchurch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Edward</hi> II. following the footſteps of his Father; after giuing out a Summons againſt the Abbot of <hi>Walden,</hi> for citing the Abbot of Saint <hi>Albons</hi> and others in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> gaue out letters for his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe, becauſe a certaine Prebend of <hi>Banburie</hi> had drawen one <hi>Beuercoat</hi> by a Plea to <hi>Rome</hi> without the Kings Dominions, therefore were letters of Caption ſent foorth againſt the ſaid Prebend.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Edward</hi> III. following likewiſe the example of his Predeceſſours; Becauſe a Parſon of <hi>Liche</hi> had ſummoned the Prior of <hi>S. Oſwalds</hi> before the Pope at <hi>Auinion;</hi> for hauing before the Iudges in <hi>England</hi> recouered the arrerage of a penſion; directed a Precept, for ſeaſing vpon all the goods both Spirituall and Temporall of the ſaid Parſon, becauſe hee had done this in preiudice of the King and Crowne. The ſaide King alſo made one <hi>Harwoden</hi> to bee declared culpable and worthie to bee puniſhed, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Popes <hi>Bulles</hi> againſt a Iudgement that was giuen by the Kings Iudges.</p>
            <p>And likewiſe; Becauſe one entred vpon the Priorie of <hi>Barnewell</hi> by the <hi>Popes Bul,</hi> the ſaid Intrant was committed to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> there to remaine during the Kings pleaſure.</p>
            <p>So as my Predeceſſors (ye ſee) of this Kingdome, euen when the <hi>Popes</hi> triumphed in their greatneſſe, ſpared not to puniſh any of their Subiects, that would preferre the <hi>Popes</hi> Obedience to theirs, euen in Church-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: So farre were they then from either acknowledging the <hi>Pope</hi> for their temporall Superiour, or yet from doubting that their owne Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were not their Subiects. And now I will cloſe vp all theſe examples with an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> in King <hi>Richard</hi> II. his time; whereby it was prohibited, That none ſhould procure a Benefice from <hi>Rome,</hi> vnder paine to be put out of the Kings protection. And thus may yee ſee, that what thoſe Kings ſucceſſiuely one to another by foure generations haue acted in priuate, the ſame was alſo maintained by a publike Law.</p>
            <p>By theſe few examples now (I hope) I haue ſufficiently cleered my ſelfe from the imputation, that any ambition or deſire of Noueltie in mee ſhould haue ſtirred mee, either to robbe the <hi>Pope</hi> of any thing due vnto him, or to aſſume vnto my ſelfe any farther authoritie, then that which other Chriſtian <hi>Emperours</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> through the world, and my owne Predeceſſours of <hi>England</hi> in eſpeciall, haue long agone maintained. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it enough to ſay (as <hi>Parſons</hi> doeth in his Anſwere to the Lord <hi>Coke</hi>) That farre more Kings of this Countrey haue giuen many more exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of acknowledging, or not reſiſting the <hi>Popes</hi> vſurped Authorities; ſome
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:23110:172"/>perchance lacking the occaſion; and ſome the abilitie of reſiſting them: for euen by the Ciuill Law, in the caſe of violent intruſion and long and wrongfull poſſeſſion againſt mee, it is enough if I prooue that I haue made lawfull interruption vpon conuenient occaſions.</p>
            <p>But the Cardinall thinkes the Oath, not onely vnlawfull for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance therof, but alſo in regard of the Perſon whom vnto it is to be ſworne: For (ſaith he) <hi>The King is not a Catholique;</hi> And in two or three other places of his booke, he ſticketh not to call me by my name very broadly, an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike, as I haue already told. But yet before I be publikely declared an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike; by the Popes owne Law my people ought not to refuſe their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto me. And (I truſt) if I were but a ſubiect, and accuſed by the Pope in his <hi>Conclaue</hi> before his Cardinals, hee would haue hard prouing mee an Heretike, if he iudged me by their owne ancient Orders.</p>
            <p>For firſt, I am no <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> as the Cardinal would make me; not onely ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing euer bene brought vp in that Religion which I preſently profeſſe, but euen my Father and Grandfather on that ſide profeſſing the ſame: and ſo cannot be properly an Heretike, by their owne doctrine, ſince I neuer was of their Church. And as for the Queene my Mother of worthy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; although ſhe continued in that Religion wherein ſhee was nouriſhed, yet was ſhe ſo farre from being ſuperſtitious or <hi>Ieſuited</hi> therein, that at my Baptiſme (although I was baptized by a Popiſh Archbiſhop) ſhe ſent him word to forbeare to vſe the ſpettle in my Baptiſme; which was obeyed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed a filthy and an apiſh tricke, rather in ſcorne then imitation of CHRIST. And her owne very words were, <hi>That ſhe would not haue a pockie priest to ſpet in her childs mouth.</hi> As alſo the Font wherein I was Chriſtened, was ſent from the late Queene here of famous memory, who was my God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother; and what her Religion was, <hi>Pius V.</hi> was not ignorant. And for further proofe, that that renowmed Queene my Mother was not ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; as in all her Letters (whereof I receiued many) ſhe neuer made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion, nor laboured to perſwade me in it; ſo at her laſt words, ſhe commanded her Maſter-houſhold, a Scottiſh Gentleman my ſeruant and yet aliue, ſhe commanded him (I ſay) to tell me; That although ſhe was of another Religion then that wherein I was brought vp; yet ſhe would not preſſe me to change, except my owne Conſcience forced mee to it: For ſo that I led a good life, and were carefull to doe Iuſtice and gouerne well; ſhe doubted not but I would be in a good caſe with the profeſſion of my owne Religion. Thus am I no <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> nor yet a deborder from that Religion which one part of my Parents profeſſed, and an other part gaue mee good allowance of. Neither can my Baptiſme in the rites of their Religion make me an <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> or Heretike in reſpect of my preſent profeſſion, ſince we all agree in the ſubſtance thereof, being all Baptized <hi>In the Name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost:</hi> vpon which head there is no variance amongſt vs.</p>
            <p>And now for the point of Heretike; I will neuer bee aſhamed to render
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:23110:173"/>an accompt of my profeſſion, and of that hope that is in me, as the Apoſtle preſcribeth. I am ſuch a CATHOLIKE CHRISTIAN, as belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the three <hi>Creeds;</hi> That of the Apoſtles, that of the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> and that of <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> the two latter being Paraphraſes to the former: And I beleeue them in that ſenſe, as the ancient Fathers and Councels that made them did vnderſtand them: To which three <hi>Creeds</hi> all the Miniſters of England doe ſubſcribe at their Ordination. And I alſo acknowledge for Orthodoxe all thoſe other formes of <hi>Creedes,</hi> that either were deuiſed by Councels or particular Fathers, againſt ſuch particular Hereſies as moſt reigned in their times.</p>
            <p>I reuerence and admit the foure firſt generall Councels as Catholique and Orthodoxe: And the ſaid foure generall Councels are acknowledged by our Acts of Parliament, and receiued for Orthodoxe by our Church.</p>
            <p>As for the Fathers; I reuerence them as much and more then the <hi>Ie ſuites</hi> doe, and as much as themſelues euer craued. For what euer the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for the firſt fiue hundreth yeeres did with an vnanime conſent agree vpon, to be beleeued as a neceſſary point of ſaluation, I either will beleeue it alſo, or at leaſt will be humbly ſilent; not taking vpon mee to condemne the ſame: But for euery priuate Fathers opinion, it bindes not my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence more then <hi>Bellarmines;</hi> euery one of the Fathers vſually contradicting others. I will therefore in that caſe follow
<note n="1" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cont. Creſconium. cap.</hi> 32.</note> 
               <hi>S. Augustines</hi> rule in iudging of their opinions, as I finde them agree with the Scriptures: what I finde agreeable thereunto I will gladly imbrace; what is otherwiſe I will (with their reuerence) reiect.</p>
            <p>As for the Scriptures; no man doubteth I will beleeue them: But euen for the <hi>Apocrypha;</hi> I hold them in the ſame accompt that the Ancients did: They are ſtill printed and bound with our Bibles, and publikely read in our Churches: I reuerence them as the writings of holy and good men: but ſince they are not found in the <hi>Canon,</hi> wee accompt them to bee <hi>ſecundae lectionis,</hi> or
<note n="2" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de verb. Vei. c.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>ordinis</hi> (which is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne diſtinction) and therefore not ſufficient whereupon alone to ground any article of Faith, except it be confirmed by ſome other place of Canonicall Scripture; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding this point with <hi>Ruffinus</hi> (who is no Noueliſt, I hope) That the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphall</hi> books were by the Fathers permitted to be read; not for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Doctrine, but onely for inſtruction of the people.</p>
            <p>As for the Saints departed, I honour their memory, and in honour of them doe we in our Church obſerue the dayes of ſo many of them, as the Scripture doeth canonize for Saints; but I am loath to beleeue all the tales of the <hi>Legended ſaints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt for the bleſſed Virgin MARIE, I yeeld her that which the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> pronounced of her, and which in her <hi>Canticle</hi> ſhee prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied of herſelfe: that is, That
<note n="3" place="margin">Luk. 1.28.</note> ſhe is bleſſed amongſt women, and
<note n="4" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 48.</note> That all generations ſhall call her bleſſed. I reuerence her as the Mother of CHRIST, whom of our Sauiour tooke his fleſh, and ſo the Mother
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:23110:173"/>of GOD, ſince the Diuinitie and Humanitie of CHRIST are inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. And I freely confeſſe, that ſhee is in glory both aboue Angels and men, her owne Sonne (that is both GOD and man) onely excepted. But I dare not mocke her and blaſpheme againſt GOD, calling her not onely <hi>Diua</hi> but <hi>Dea,</hi> and praying her to command and controule her Sonne, who is her GOD; and her SAVIOVR: Nor yet not I thinke, that ſhee hath no other thing to doe in heauen, then to heare euery idle mans ſuite, and buſie her ſelfe in their errands; whiles requeſting, whiles commanding her Sonne, whiles comming downe to kiſſe and make loue with Prieſtes, and whiles diſputing and brawling with Deuils. In heauen ſhee is in eternall glory and ioy, neuer to bee interrupted with any worldly buſineſſe; and there I leaue her with her bleſſed Sonne our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOVR and hers in eternall felicitie.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Prayer to Saints;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mart. 11.28.</note> CHRIST (I am ſure) hath commanded vs to Come all to him that are loaden with ſinne, and hee will relieue vs: and <hi>Saint Paul</hi> hath forbidden vs to worſhip Angels;
<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2.8, 23.</note> or to vſe any ſuch voluntary worſhip, that hath a ſhew of humilitie in that it ſpareth not the fleſh. But what warrant wee haue to haue recourſe vnto theſe <hi>Dij Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates</hi> or <hi>Tutelares,</hi> theſe Courtiers of GOD, I know not; I remit that to theſe Philoſophicall Neoterike Diuines. It ſatisfieth mee to pray to GOD through CHRIST as I am commanded, which I am ſure muſt be the ſafeſt way; and I am ſure the ſafeſt way is the beſt way in points of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. But if the Romiſh Church hath coined new Articles of Faith, neuer heard of in the firſt 500. yeeres after CHRIST, I hope I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee condemned for an Heretike, for not being a Noueliſt. Such are the <hi>priuate Maſses,</hi> where the Prieſt playeth the part both of the Prieſt and of the people; And ſuch are the <hi>Amputation of the one halfe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> from the people; <hi>The Tranſsubstantiation, Eleuation for Adoration,</hi> and <hi>Circumportation</hi> in Proceſſion of the Sacrament; <hi>the workes of Superero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> rightly named <hi>Theſaurus Eccleſiae; the Baptiſing of Bels,</hi> and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other trickes: But aboue all, <hi>the worſhipping of Images.</hi> If my faith beeweake in theſe, I confeſſe I had rather beleeue too little then too much: And yet ſince I beleeue as much as the Scriptures doe warrant, the Creeds doe perſwade, and the ancient Councels decreed, I may well be a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike from <hi>Rome,</hi> but I am ſure I am no Heretike.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Reliques of Saints;</hi> If I had any ſuch that I were aſſured were members of their bodies, I would honourably bury them, and not giue them the reward of condemned mens members, which are onely ordeined to bee depriued of buriall. But for worſhipping either them or <hi>Images,</hi> I muſt account it damnable Idolatrie.</p>
            <p>I am no <hi>Iconomachus;</hi> I quarrell not the making of Images, either for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like decoration, or for mens priuate vſes: But that they ſhould bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, bee prayed to, or any holineſſe attributed vnto them, was neuer knowen of the Ancients: And the Scriptures are ſo directly, vehemently
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:23110:174"/>and punctually againſt it, as I wonder what braine of man, or ſuggeſtion of Sathan durſt offer it to Chriſtians; and all muſt bee ſalued with nice Philoſophicall diſtinctions: As, <hi>Idolum nihilest:</hi> and, They worſhip (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) the Images of things <hi>in being,</hi> and the Image of the trew GOD. But the Scripture forbiddeth to worſhip the Image of any thing that GOD created. It was not a <hi>nibil</hi> then that God forbade onely to be worſhipped, neither was the braſen Serpent, nor the body of <hi>Moſes</hi> a <hi>nihil;</hi> and yet the one was deſtroyed, and the other hidden for eſchewing of Idolatrie. Yea, the Image of GOD himſelfe is not onely expreſly forbidden to bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, but euen to bee made. The reaſon is giuen, That no eye euer ſaw GOD; and how can we paint his face, when <hi>Moſes</hi> (the man that euer was moſt familiar with GOD) neuer ſawe but his backe parts? Surely, ſince he cannot be drawen to the <hi>viue,</hi> it is a thankeleſſe labour to marre it with a falſe repreſentation; which no Prince, nor ſcarce any other man will bee contented with in their owne pictures. Let them therefore that maintaine this doctrine, anſwere it to CHRIST at the latter day, when he ſhall accuſe them of Idolatrie; And then I doubt if hee will bee payed with ſuch nice ſophiſticall Diſtinctions.</p>
            <p>But CHRISTS Croſſe muſt haue a particular priuiledge (ſay they) and bee worſhipped <hi>ratione contactus.</hi> But firſt wee muſt know what kinde of touching of CHRISTS body drew a vertue from it; whether euery touching, or onely touching by faith? That euery touching of his body drew not vertue from it, is more then manifeſt. When
<note n="1" place="margin">Luke 8.</note> the woman in the bloody fluxe touched him, ſhe was healed of her faith: But <hi>Peter</hi> then told him that a crowd and throng of many people then touched him; and yet none of them receiued any benefite or vertue from him. <hi>Iudas</hi> touched him many and many a time, beſides his laſt kiſſe; ſo did the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines that buffeted and crucified him; and yet I may ſafely pronounce them accurſed, that would beſtow any worſhip vpon their reliques: yea wee cannot denie but the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> itſelfe (whereupon our Lord did dayly tread) is ſo viſibly accurſed, beeing gouerned by faithleſſe <hi>Turkes,</hi> full of innumerable ſects of hereticall Chriſtians, and the very fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie thereof ſo farre degenerated into a pitifull ſterilitie, as hee muſt bee accurſed that accounteth it bleſſed. Nay, when a certaine
<note n="2" place="margin">Luk. 11.28.</note> woman bleſſed the belly that bare CHRIST, and the breaſtes that gaue him ſucke; Nay, rather (ſaith hee) <hi>Bleſsed are thoſe that heare the Word of God, and keepe it.</hi> Except then they could firſt prooue that CHRIST had reſolued to bleſſe that tree of the Croſſe whereupon hee was nailed; they can neuer proue that his touching it could giue it any vertue. And put the caſe it had a vertue of doing miracles, as <hi>Peters</hi> ſhadow had; yet doeth it not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it is lawful to worſhip it, which <hi>Peter</hi> would neuer accept of. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Prophets that in ſo many places curſe thoſe that worſhip Images, that haue eyes and ſee not, that haue eares and heare not, would much more haue curſed them that worſhip a piece of a ſticke, that hath not ſo much
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:23110:174"/>as any reſemblance or repreſentation of eyes or eares.</p>
            <p>As for Purgatorie and all the
<note n="*" place="margin">Iubilees, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions for the dead, &amp;c.</note> traſh depending thereupon, it is not worth the talking of; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cannot finde any ground for it in all the Scriptures. Onely I would pray him to tell me; If that faire greene Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow that is in Purgatorie, haue a brooke running thorow it;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> 2 <hi>de Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat. cap</hi> 7.</note> that in caſe I come there, I may haue hawking vpon it. But as for me; I am ſure there is a Heauen and a Hell, <hi>praemium &amp; poena,</hi> for the Elect and reprobate: How many other roomes there be, I am not on God his counſell.
<note place="margin">Iohn 14.</note> 
               <hi>Multae ſunt manſiones in domo Patris mei,</hi> ſaith CHRIST, who is the trew Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for our ſinnes: But how many chambers and anti-chambers the diuell hath, they can beſt tell that goe to him: But in caſe there were more places for ſoules to goe to then we know of, yet let vs content vs with that which in his Word he hath reuealed vnto vs, and not inquire further into his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.

            <p>Now in all this diſcourſe haue I yet left out the maine Article of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh faith; and that is the <hi>Head of the Church</hi> or <hi>Peters Primacie;</hi> for who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth this, denieth <hi>fidem Catholicam,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> That Biſhops ought to be in the Church, I euer maintained it, as an Apoſtolique inſtitution, and ſo the ordinance of God; contrary to the <hi>Puritanes,</hi> and likewiſe to

               <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine;</hi> who denies that Biſhops haue their Iuriſdiction immediatly from God (But it is no wonder he takes the <hi>Puritanes</hi> part, ſince <hi>Ieſuits</hi> are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Puritan-papists.</hi>) And as I euer maintained the ſtate of Biſhops, and the Eccleſiaſticall Hierarchie for order ſake; ſo was I euer an enemie to the confuſed Anarchie or paritie of the <hi>Puritanes,</hi> as well appeareth in my <gap reason="foreign">

Heauen is gouerned by order, and all the good Angels there; nay, Hell it ſelfe could not ſubſiſt without ſome order; And the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deuils are diuided into Legions, and haue their chiefetaines: how can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſocietie then vpon earth, ſubſiſt without order and degrees? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot enough wonder with what braſen face this Anſwerer could ſay, <hi>That I was a Puritane in Scotland, and an enemie to Proteſtants:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 98.</note> I that was perſecuted by <hi>Puritanes</hi> there, not from my birth onely, but euen ſince foure moneths before my birth? I that in the yeere of God 84 erected Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and depreſſed all their popular Paritie, I then being not 18. yeeres of aage? I that in my ſaid Booke to my Sonne, doe ſpeake tenne times more bitterly of them nor of the Papiſts; hauing in my ſecond Edition thereof, affixed a long Apologetike Preface, onely in <hi>odium Puritanorum?</hi> and I that for the ſpace of ſixe yeeres before my comming into England, laboured no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as to depreſſe their Paritie, and re-erect Biſhops againe? Nay, if the dayly Commentaries of my life and actions in Scotland, were written (as <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> were) there would ſcarcely a moneth paſſe in all my life, ſince my entring into the 13. yeere of my aage, wherein ſomeac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or other would not conuince the Cardinall of a Lye in this point.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:23110:175"/>And ſurely I giue a faire commendation to the Puritanes in that place of my booke, Where I affirme that I haue found greater honeſtie with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and border theeues, then with that ſort of people. But leauing him to his owne impudence, I returne to my purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and Church Hierarchie I very well allowe (as I ſaid before) and likewiſe of Ranks and Degrees amongſt <hi>Biſhops. Patriarches</hi> (I know) were in the time of the Primitiue Church, and I likewiſe reuerence that Inſtitution for order ſake: and amongſt them was a contention for the firſt place. And for my ſelfe (if that were yet the queſtion) I would with all my heart giue my conſent that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould haue the firſt Seate: I being a weſterne King would goe with the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of the Weſt. And for his temporall Principalitie ouer the Signory of <hi>Rome,</hi> I doe not quarrell it neither; let him in God his Name be <hi>Primus Epiſcopus inter om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Epiſcopos,</hi> and <hi>Princeps Epiſcoporum;</hi> ſo it be no otherwiſe but as <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>Princeps Apoſtolorum.</hi> But as I well allow of the Hierarchie of the Church for diſtinction of orders (for ſo I vnderſtand it) ſo I vtterly deny that there is an earthly <hi>Monarch</hi> thereof, whoſe word muſt be a Law, and who cannot erre in his Sentence, by an infallibilitie of Spirit. Becauſe carthly Kingdomes muſt haue earthly <hi>Monarches;</hi> it doeth not follow, that the Church muſt haue a viſible <hi>Monarch</hi> too: for the world hath not ONE earthly temporall <hi>Monarch.</hi> CHRIST is his Churches <hi>Monarch,</hi> and the holy Ghoſt his Deputie:
<note place="margin">Luke 22.25.</note> 
               <hi>Reges gentium dominantur eorum, vos au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem non ſic.</hi> CHRIST did not promiſe before his aſcenſion, to leaue <hi>Peter</hi> with them to direct and iuſtruct them in all things;
<note place="margin">Iohn 14.26.</note> but he promiſed to ſend the holy Ghoſt vnto them for that end.</p>
            <p>And as for theſe two before cited places, whereby <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maketh the Pope to triumph ouer Kings:
<note place="margin">Matth. 18.18.</note> I meane <hi>Paſce oues,</hi> and <hi>Tibi dobo claues:</hi> the Cardinall knowes well enough, that the ſame words of <hi>Tibi dabo,</hi> are in another place ſpoken by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the plurall number. And he likewiſe knowes what reaſon the Ancients doe giue, why <hi>Chriſt</hi> bade <hi>Pater paſcere oues</hi> and alſo what a cloude of witneſſes there is, both of Ancients, and euen of late Popiſh writers, yea diuers Cardinals, that do all agree that both theſe ſpeeches vſed to <hi>Peter,</hi> were meant to all the Apoſtles repreſenred in his perſon:
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.4.</note> Otherwiſe how could <hi>Paul</hi> direct the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to excommunicate the inceſtuous perſon <hi>cum ſpiritu ſuo,</hi> whereas he ſhould then haue ſayd, <hi>cum ſpiritu Petri?</hi> And how could all the Apoſtles haue otherwiſe vſed all their cenſures, onely in <hi>Chriſts</hi> Name, and neuer a word of his Vicar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> (wee reade) did in all the Apoſtles meetings ſit amongſt them as one of their number: And when choſen men were ſent to <hi>Antiochia</hi> from that great Apoſtolike <hi>Councel</hi> at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 15.)
<note place="margin">Act. 15.22, 23.</note> The text ſaith, It ſeemed good to the Apoſtles and Elders with the whole Church, to ſend choſen men, but no mention made of the Head thereof; and ſo in their Letters no mention is made of <hi>Peter,</hi> but onely of the Apoſtles, Elders and Brethren. And it is a wonder, why <hi>Paul</hi> rebuketh the Church of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:23110:175"/>
               <hi>Corinth</hi> for making exception of Perſons, becauſe ſome followed <hi>Paul,</hi> ſome <hi>Apollos,</hi> ſome <hi>Cephas,</hi> if <hi>Peter</hi> was their viſible Head!
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.12.</note> for then thoſe that followed not <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> renounced the Catholike faith. But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth well that <hi>Paul</hi> knew little of our new doctrine, ſince he handleth <hi>Peter</hi> ſo rudely,
<note place="margin">Galat. 2.</note> as he not onely compareth but preferreth himſelfe vnto him. But our Cardinall proues <hi>Peters</hi> ſuperioritie,
<note place="margin">Galat. 1.18.</note> by <hi>Pauls</hi> going to viſite him. Indeed <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, hee went to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to viſite <hi>Peter,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with him; but he ſhould haue added, and to kiſſe his feet.</p>
            <p>To conclude then, The trweth is that <hi>Peter</hi> was both in aage, and in the time of CHRISTS calling him, one of the firſt of the Apoſtles; In order the principall of the firſt twelue, and one of the three whom CHRIST for order ſake preferred to all the reſt. And no further did the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> claime for three hundred yeeres after CHRIST: Subiect they were to the generall Councels, and euen but of late did the Councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> depoſe three Popes, and ſet vp the fourth. And vntill Phocas dayes (that murthered his maſter) were they ſubiect to Emperours. But how they are now come to be <hi>Chriſts</hi> Vicars, nay, Gods on earth, triple-crowned, Kings of heauen, earth and hell, Iudges of all the world, and none to iudge them; Heads of the faith, Abſolute deciders of all Controuerſies by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of their ſpirit, hauing all power both Spirituall and Temporall in their hands; the high Biſhops, Monarches of the whole earth, Superiours to all Emperours and Kings; yea, Supreme Vice-gods, who whether they will or not cannot erre: how they are now come (I ſay) to the toppe of greatneſſe, I know not: but ſure I am, Wee that are KINGS haue greateſt neede to looke vnto it. As for me, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> I know, but theſe men I know not: And yet to doubt of this, is to denie the Catholique faith; Nay, the world it ſelfe muſt be turned vpſide downe,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellar. de Rom. Pont. li.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.</note> and the order of Nature inuerted (making the left hand to haue the place before the Right, and the laſt named to bee the firſt in honour) that this primacie may bee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I now made a free Confeſſion of my Faith: And (I hope) I haue fully cleared my ſelfe from being an Apoſtate, and as farre from being an Heretike, as one may bee that beleeueth the Scriptures, and the three Creedes, and acknowledgeth the foure firſt generall Councels. If I bee loath to beleeue too much, eſpecially of Nouelties, men of greater knowledge may well pitie my weakeneſſe; but I am ſure none will condemne me for an Heretike, ſaue ſuch as make the Pope their God; and thinke him ſuch aſpeaking Scripture, as they can define Hereſie no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but to bee whatſoeuer Opinion is maintained againſt the Popes definition of faith. And I will ſincerely promiſe, that when euer any point of the Religion I profeſſe, ſhalbe proued to be new, and not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, Catholike, and Apoſtolike (I meane for matter of Faith) I will as ſoone renounce it; cloſing vp this head with the <hi>Maxime</hi> of <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Libello ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſus hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> that I will neuer refuſe to imbrace any opinion in Diuinity neceſſary to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:23110:176"/>ſaluation, which the whole Catholike Church With an vnanime conſent, haue conſtantly taught and beleeued euen from the Apoſtles dayes, for the ſpace of many aages thereafter without any interruption. But in the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals opinion, I haue ſhewed my ſelfe an Heretike (I am ſure) in playing with the name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Towne vpon <hi>ſeuen hilles;</hi> as if I would inſinuate <hi>Rome</hi> at this preſent to be ſpiritually <hi>Babylon.</hi> And yet that <hi>Rome</hi> is called <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.13.</note> both in <hi>Saint Peters</hi> Epiſtle, and in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer freely confeſſeth. As for the definition of the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> I will not vrge ſo obſcure a point, as a matter of Faith to bee neceſſarily beleeued of all Chriſtians; but what I thinke herein, I will ſimply declare.</p>
            <p>That there muſt be an <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and in his time a generall Defection; wee all agree. But the <hi>Time, Seat,</hi> and <hi>Perſon</hi> of this <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> are the chiefe Queſtions whereupon wee differ: and for that we muſt ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for our reſolution.
<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.</note> As for my opinion; I thinke S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 2. to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> doeth vtter more clearely that which <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh more myſtically of the <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, that in that place hee meaneth the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> it is plaine, ſince hee ſaith,
<note place="margin">Verſe 3.</note> 
               <hi>There muſt bee first a Defection;</hi> and that in the <hi>Antichriſts</hi> time onely that eclipſe of Defection muſt fall vpon the Church, all the <hi>Romiſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes</hi> are ſtrong enough: otherwiſe their Church muſt be daily ſubiect to erre,
<note place="margin">Verſe 3, 4.</note> which is cleane contrary to their maine doctrine. Then deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing him (hee ſaith) that <hi>The man of Sinne, Filius perditionis, ſhall exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aboue all that is called God.</hi> But who theſe be whom of the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> ſaith <hi>Dixi vos Dij estis,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 82.6.</note> Bellarmine</hi> can tell. In old Diuinitie it was wont to bee <hi>Kings; Bellarmine</hi> will adde <hi>Churchmen;</hi> Let it bee both. It is well enough knowen, who now exalteth himſelfe aboue both the ſwords.</p>
            <p>And after that S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath thus deſcribed the <hi>Perſon,</hi> he next deſcribeth the <hi>Seat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2.4.</note> and telleth that <hi>He ſhall ſit in the Temple of God,</hi> that is, the boſome of the Church; yea, in the very heart thereof. Now where this Apoſtolike Seat is, I leaue to bee gueſſed: And likewiſe who it is that ſitting there, ſheweth himſelfe to be GOD; pardoning ſinnes, redeeming ſoules, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining Faith, controlling and iudging all men, and to be iudged of none.</p>
            <p>Anent the <hi>Time, S. Paul</hi> is plaineſt of all: For hee calleth the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> to memorie,
<note place="margin">Verſe 5.</note> 
               <hi>That when hee was with them, hee told them theſe things;</hi> and therefore <hi>they know</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>what the impediment was,
<note place="margin">Verſe 6.</note> and who did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold that the man of Sinne was not reuealed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſe 7.</note> although <hi>the myſterie of iniquitie was already working.</hi> That the Romane Emperours in <hi>Saint Pauls</hi> time needed no reuealing to the Chriſtians to bee men of Sinne or ſinfull men, no childe doubteth: but the reuelation hee ſpeaketh of was a <hi>mysterie,</hi> a <hi>ſecret;</hi> It ſhould therefore ſeeme that hee durſt not publiſh in his Epiſtle what that impediment was. It may be he meant by the tranſlating of the Seat of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, and that the tranſlation thereof ſhould leaue a roume for the man of <hi>Sinne</hi> to ſit downe in. And that he meant not <hi>that man of Sinne</hi> of theſe Ethnicke Emperours in his time, his introduction to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:23110:176"/>this diſcourſe maketh it more then manifeſt. For he ſaith (fearing they ſhould be deceiued, thinking the day of the Lords ſecond comming to bee at hand) he hath therefore thought good to forewarne them that this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Defection muſt firſt come: Whereby it well appeareth that hee could not meane by the preſent time but by a future, and that a good long time; otherwiſe he proued ill his argument, that the Lords comming was not at hand. Neither can the forme of the Deſtruction of this man of <hi>Sinne</hi> agree with that maner of ſpoile, that the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> made of
<note n="*" place="margin">For ſo doeth <hi>Tortus</hi> call <hi>Rome</hi> when it was ſpoiled by them, though it was Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an many yeres before.</note> 
               <hi>Ethnick Rome:</hi> For our Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 Verſe 8.</note> 
               <hi>That this wicked man ſhull bee conſumed by the Spirit of the Lords mouth, and aboliſhed by his comming.</hi> Now I would thinke that the word of God and the Preaching thereof, ſhould be meant <hi>by the Spirit of the Lords mouth,</hi> which ſhould peece and peece con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and diminiſh the power of that man of Sinne, till the brightnes of the Lords ſecond comming ſhould vtterly aboliſh him. And by his expreſſing the meanes of his working, he doeth likewiſe (in my opinion) explane his meaning very much: For he ſaith, <hi>It ſhall be by a ſtrong deluſion,
<note place="margin">Verſe. 8.9.</note> by lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp;c.</hi> Well, what Church it is that vanteth them of their innumerable miracles, and yet moſt of them contrary to their owne doctrine; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can beſt tell you with his hungry Mare,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bellar lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Euchariſt. cap.</hi> 8</note> that turned her taile to her prouen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and kneeled to the Sacrament: And yet (I am ſure) he will be aſhamed to ſay, that the holy Sacrament is ordained to be worſhipped by <hi>Oues &amp; Boues, &amp; caetera pecora campi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus haue I prooued out of <hi>S. Paul</hi> now, that the time of the Antichriſts comming, and the generall Defection was not to be till long after the time that he wrote in; That his Seat was to be in the Temple and Church of God; and, That his Action (which can beſt point at his Perſon) ſhould be to <hi>Exalt himſelfe aboue all that were called Gods. S. Iohn</hi> indeed doth more amply, though myſtically deſcribe this Antichriſt, which vnder the figure of a monſtrous Beaſt, with ſeuen heads and ten hornes, he ſets forth in the xiij. chap. and then interpreteth in the xvij. where hee calles her a <hi>Whore ſitting vpon many waters,</hi> and <hi>riding vpon the ſayd monſtrous Beast;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reuel. 17. v. 1. Verſ. 3.</note> concluding that chapter with calling that Woman, <hi>that great City which reigneth ouer the Kings of the earth.</hi> And both in that Chapter,
<note place="margin">Verſ 18.</note> and in the beginning of the next he calles that great Citie, <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 5. Cap. 18. v. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>So as to continue herein my formerly purpoſed Methode, of the Time, Seat, and Perſon of Antichriſt; this place doth clearely and vndenyably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that <hi>Rome</hi> is, or ſhalbe the Seat of that Antichriſt. For firſt, no Papiſt now denieth that by <hi>Babylon</hi> here <hi>Rome</hi> is directly meant; and that this Woman is the Antichriſt, doeth clearely appeare by the time of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (deſcribed by 42. moneths in the xiij. Chap.)
<note place="margin">Verſ. 5.</note> which doeth iuſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with that three yeeres and a halfes time, which all the Papiſts giue to the Reigne of Antichriſt. Beſides that, the Beaſt it ſelfe with ſeuen heads and tenne hornes, hauing one of her heads wounded and healed againe, is deſcribed iuſt alike in the xiij. and xvij. Chap. being in the former prooued
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:23110:177"/>to be the <hi>Antichrist</hi> by the time of her reigne; and in the latter <hi>Rome</hi> by the name of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the confeſſion of all the Papiſts, So as one point is now cleare, that <hi>Rome</hi> is the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Antichrist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither will that place in the eleuenth Chapter ſerue to ſhift off this point, and proue the <hi>Antichrists Seat</hi> to bee in <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> where it is ſaide;
<note place="margin">Chap. 11.8.</note> 
               <hi>That the Corpſes of the Witneſſes ſhall lie in the great City, ſpiritually Sodome and Egypt, where our Lord alſo was crucified.</hi> For the word <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> is applied both to <hi>Sodome, Egypt</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in that place; And when hee hath named <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> hee doeth not ſubioyne <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> with a ſingle <hi>vbi;</hi> but with an <hi>vbi &amp;,</hi> as if hee would ſay; and this <hi>Antichriſts</hi> abomination ſhall bee ſo great, as his Seate ſhall bee as full of Spirituall whoredomes and Idolatries, as <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> was; nay, and ſo bloody in the perſecution of the Saints, as our Lord ſhall be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againe in his members. And who hath ſo meanely read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (if he haue euer read them at all) that knoweth it not to be a common phraſe in them,
<note place="margin">Matt. 25.40.</note> to call CHRIST perſecuted and ſlaine, when his Saints are ſo vſed?
<note place="margin">Acts 9.4.</note> So did CHRIST ſay, ſpeaking of the latter day; and in the ſame ſtyle did hee ſpeake to <hi>S. Paul</hi> at his conuerſion. And that <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> (ſince <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is contented it bee ſo called) is that great Citie where our Lord was crucified,
<note place="margin">Reuel. 18.24.</note> the laſt verſe of the xviij. Chap. doeth alſo clearely proue it: For there it is ſaid, That <hi>in that City was found the blood of the Prophets, and of the Saints, and of all that were ſlaine vpon the earth;</hi> and I hope CHRIST was one of them that were ſlaine vpon the earth. And beſides that it may well bee ſaid that hee was ſlaine in that great Citie <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſince by the <hi>Romane</hi> authoritie hee was put to death, vnder a <hi>Romane</hi> Iudge, and for a <hi>Romane</hi> quarrell: for he could not be a friend to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that was not his enemie.</p>
            <p>This point now being cleared of the <hi>Antichriſts Seate,</hi> as I haue already ſayd; we are next to find out the <hi>Time</hi> when the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall reigne, if it be not already come.
<note place="margin">Cha. 13.3.</note> In the xiij. Chapter. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> ſaith, that this Beaſt with the ſeuen heads and tenne hornes,
<note place="margin">Chap. 17.10.</note> 
               <hi>had one of his heads wounded and healed againe;</hi> and interpreting that in the xvij. he ſaith, that <hi>theſe ſeuen heads are alſo ſeuen Kings, whereof fiue are fallen, one is, and an other is not yet come, and when hee commeth hee ſhall continue a ſhort ſpace.
<note place="margin">Verſe 11.</note> And the Beaſt that was and is not, is the eight, and yet one of the ſeuen.</hi> By which Beaſt hee meaneth the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who was not then come, I meane in the Apoſtles dayes, but was to come after. So as betweene the time of the Apoſtles and the ende of the worlde, muſt the <hi>Time</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſts</hi> comming be; and with this the Papiſts doe alſo agree. Whereby it appeareth that <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall bee the <hi>Seate</hi> of the <hi>Antichriſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reuel. 1.1. &amp; chap. 4.1.</note> but not that <hi>Ethnicke Rome</hi> which was in the Apoſtles dayes (for <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelfe profeſſeth that hee is to write of nothing, but that which is to come after his time.)

            <p>But here it may bee obiected, that the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> cannot reigne a long ſpace; ſince S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith in two or three ſundry places, that the <hi>Antichrist</hi> ſhall worke but the ſpace of three yeeres and a halfe.

For as to that literall interpretation (as all the Papiſts make it) of three yeeres and a halfe, and that time to ſall out direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the very laſt dayes, ſaue fiue and fourtie, before CHRIST his ſecond comming, it is directly repugnant to the whole New TESTAMENT.

Thus ye ſee: how ſhamefully he abuſeth CHRISTS words, who in three ſundry places (as I haue ſaid) interpreteth the ſecond comming of <hi>Elias</hi> to be meant by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> He likewiſe cauils moſt diſhoneſtly vpon that word <hi>Venturus.</hi> For CHRIST vſeth that word but in the repeating their opinion: but interpreting it that he was already come, in the <hi>perſon of Iohn Baptist.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 17.11.</note> As if hee had ſaid, The prophecie is indeed trew that <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall come; but I ſay vnto you, that <hi>Elias iam venit,</hi> meaning of <hi>Iohn Baptist:</hi> and ſo he firſt repeats the words of the prophecie in the future time, as the

And ſince <hi>Ipſe dixit;</hi> nay, <hi>ter dixit, per quem facta ſunt omnia,</hi> what mortall man dare interprete him otherwiſe; nay, directly contrary?</p>
            <p>Now for that place of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ecclus. 48.8.</note> as the ſon of <hi>Sirach</hi> onely borroweth it from <hi>Malachie</hi> (as appeareth by theſe words of his,

            <p>But <hi>Enoch</hi> muſt be ioyned to <hi>Elias</hi> in this errand, onely to beare vp the couples, as I thinke. For no place of Scripture ſpeaketh of his returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, onely it is ſaid in <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> the 44. that <hi>Enoch</hi> pleaſed GOD, and was tranſlated to <hi>Paradiſe, vt daret Gentibus ſapientiam,</hi> or <hi>poenitentiam;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ecclus. 44.16.</note> ſince they will haue it ſo. And what is this to ſay? marry that <hi>Enoch</hi> ſhall returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to this world, and fight againſt the <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> A prettie large Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment indeed, but no right Commentary vpon that Text. When <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> was talking of <hi>Elias;</hi> he inſiſted, That <hi>Elias</hi> muſt come to conuert the <hi>Iewes</hi> principally, <hi>reſtituere tribus Iacob.</hi> But when he ſpeaketh here of <hi>Enoch,</hi> he muſt <hi>dare Gentibus paenitentiam,</hi> and not a word of <hi>Iewes.</hi> Belike they ſhall come for ſundry errands, and not both for one: Or like <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> the one ſhall be Apoſtle for the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and the other for the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> What need ſuch wilde racked Commentaries for ſuch three wordes? Will not the ſenſe ſtand well and clearely enough, that <hi>Enoch</hi> pleaſed GOD, and was tranſlated to <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> that by the example of his reward, the Nations might repent and imitate his Holy footſteps? For what could more mightily perſwade the Nations to repent; then by letting them ſee that holy Man carried quicke vp to Heauen, for reward of his vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; whereas all the reſt of the people died and went to corruption? And where Scripture faileth, the Cardinall muſt helpe himſelfe with the Fathers, to prooue both that <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> are yet aliue, and that they ſhall hereafter die; but with the like felicitie, as in his alledging of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; to vſe his owne words of mee in his

<note place="margin">Mart. 22, 32.</note> as CHRIST telleth vs; for God is <hi>Deus viuentium, non mortuorum.</hi> Much more then are <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> aliue, who neuer taſted of death after the maner of other men.

               <hi>Tertullian</hi> likewiſe agreeing hereunto, ſaith moſt clearely, That <hi>Enoch</hi> hath neuer taſted of death, <hi>vt aeternitatis candida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi> now he is ill priuiledged with eternitie, if he muſt die againe. As for his places cited out of the other three Fathers, they all confirme that firſt point, That they are ſtil aliue but that they muſt die again, they make no mention.</p>
            <p>But he ſpeaking of the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> let mee take this occaſion to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne you concerning them: That though they miſtake and vnderſtand not rightly many myſteries in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> it is no wonder: For the booke thereof,
<note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 2.</note> was ſtill ſealed in their dayes. And though <hi>the myſterie of iniquitie</hi> was already working, yet was not <hi>the man of Sinne</hi> yet reuealed. And it is a certaine rule in all darke prophecies; That they are neuer clearely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, till they be accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>And thus hauing anſwered his two places, in the Old <hi>Teſtament,</hi> by his third in the New <hi>Teſtament,</hi> conteining <hi>Chriſts</hi> owne words: which being <hi>luce clariora,</hi> I need ſpeake no more of them. I am now to ſpeake of the fourth place of Scripture, which is in the xj. of the <hi>Apocalyps:</hi> For the two Witneſſes (forſooth) there mentioned,
<note place="margin">Reuelat. 11.</note> muſt be <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi> But how this can ſtand with any point of Diuinitie or likelihood of reaſon, that theſe two glorified Bodies ſhall come downe out of heauen or Paradiſe, (make it what you will) preach, and fight againſt the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> bee ſlaine by him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many thouſand yeeres exempted from the naturall courſe of death, riſe againe the third day in imitation of CHRIST, and then (hauing wrought many wonders) to goe vp againe to Heauen, making an ordinary Poſte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Heauen and Earth: how this (I ſay) can agree either with Diuinitie or good Reaſon, I confeſſe it paſſeth my capacitie. And eſpecially that they muſt be clad in Sackcloth, whoſe bodies (I hope) haue bene ſo long agone free from ſinne, as I thinke they ſhall neede no more ſuch maceration for ſinne: For they muſt be now either in Heauen or <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> If in heauen, (as doubtleſſe they are) their bodies muſt bee glorified; for no corruptible thing can enter there;
<note place="margin">Reuel. 21.27.</note> and conſequently they can no more bee ſubiect to the ſenſible things of this world, eſpecially to death: But if they be in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> we muſt firſt know where it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> indeed in his Controuerſies is much troubled to finde out the place where <hi>Paradiſe</hi> is,
<note place="margin">Lib de Grat. primi hominis.</note> and whether it bee in the earth, or in the ayre.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:23110:179"/>But theſe are all vanities. The Scriptures tell vs,
<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> that <hi>Paradiſe</hi> and the garden of <hi>Eden</hi> therein, was a certaine place vpon the earth, which GOD choſe out to ſet <hi>Adam</hi> into, and hauing thereafter for his ſinne baniſhed him from the ſame, it is a blaſphemie to thinke that any of <hi>Adams</hi> poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie came euer there againe. For in <hi>Adam</hi> were all his poſteritie accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and baniſhed from the earthly <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> like as all the earth in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and <hi>Paradiſe</hi> in ſpeciall were accurſed in him; the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by grace, called a certaine number of them to bee Coheritours with him of the heauenly <hi>Paradiſe</hi> and <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> And doubtleſly, the earthly <hi>Paradiſe</hi> was defaced at the Flood, if not before: and ſo loſt all that exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite fertilitie and pleaſantneſſe, wherein it once ſurpaſſed all the reſt of the earth. And that it ſhould be lifted vp in the ayre, is like one of the dreames of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Surely no ſuch miracle is mentioned in the Scriptures, and hath no ground but from the curious fancies of ſome boyling braines, who cannot be content, <hi>Sapere ad ſobrietatem.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12.3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In heauen then for certaine are <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen 5.24. 2. King. 2.10, 11.</note> for <hi>Enoch</hi> (ſaith the Text) walked with GOD, and was taken vp, and <hi>Elias</hi> was ſeene catied vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in a fierie chariot. And that they who haue beene the In-dwellers of Heauen theſe many thouſand yeeres, and are freed from the Lawes of mortalitie; that theſe glorious and incorruptible bodies (I ſay) ſhall come in the world againe, preach and worke miracles, and fighting againſt the <hi>Antichrist</hi> be ſlaine by him, whom naturall death could not before take hold of: as it is a fabulous inuention, ſo is it quite contrary to the nature of ſuch ſanctified creatures. Eſpecially I wonder, why <hi>Enoch</hi> ſhould bee thought to bee one of theſe two Witneſſes for CHRIST: For it was <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> that were with CHRIST, at the tranſſiguration; ſignifying the Law and the Prophets: which would be the fitteſt witneſſes for conuincing of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> But why they haue exempted <hi>Moſes,</hi> and put <hi>Enochs</hi> head in the yoake, I cannot conceiue. So as I haue too much laboured in the refuting of this fooliſh, and indeed childiſh fable; which I am ſo farre from belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in any ſort, as I proteſt in GODS preſence, I cannot hold any learned Diuine (in our aage now) to be a Chriſtian, that will beleeue it; but worthy to bee ranked with the Scribes and Phariſes, that raued and dreamed vpon the comming againe of <hi>Elias,</hi> though CHRIST told them the contrary. As for ſome of the Ancients that miſtooke this matter, I doe not cenſure them ſo hardly; for the reaſon that I haue already alleaged concerning them.</p>
            <p>And hauing now refuted that idle fable; that thoſe two Witneſſes were <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias:</hi> it falleth mee next to gueſſe, what in my opinion ſhould bee meant by them. I confeſſe, it is farre eaſier to refute ſuch a groundleſſe fable as this is, contrary to all grounds of Diuinitie and Reaſon; then to ſet downe a trew interpretation of ſo high and darke a Miſtery. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as I will not preſume to bind any other man to my opinion herein, if his owne reaſon leade him not thereunto; ſo ſhall I propone ſuch probable coniectures, as (I hope) ſhall be free from Hereſie, or vnlawfull curioſitie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:23110:180"/>In two diuers faſhions may the Myſterie of theſe Witneſſes be lawfully and probably interpreted, in my opinion. Whereof the one is, that by theſe two Witneſſes ſhould be meant the Old and New Teſtaments: For as the <hi>Antichrist</hi> cannot chuſe but bee an aduerſary to the Word of GOD aboue all things; ſo will hee omit no endeuour to diſgrace, corrupt, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and deſtroy the ſame. And now whether this Booke of the two Teſtaments, or two Witneſſes of CHRIST, haue ſuffered any violence by the <hi>Babylonian Monarchie</hi> or not; I need ſay nothing; <hi>Res ipſaloquitur.</hi> I will not weary you with recounting thoſe Common Places vſed for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing it: as calling it a <hi>Noſe of waxe,</hi> a <hi>dead Letter,</hi> a <hi>leaden Rule,</hi> a hundreth ſuch like phraſes of reproch. But how farre the Traditions of men, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Church are preferred to theſe Witneſſes, doeth ſufficiently appeare in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> doctrine.

<note place="margin">Verſe 11.12.</note> and ſhine in their former glory: GOD, as it were, <hi>ſetting them vp againe vpon their feete,</hi> and <hi>raiſing them to the Heauens</hi> in a triumphall cloud of glory, like <hi>Elias</hi> his fiery chariot. Which exalting of the Goſpel againe,
<note place="margin">13.</note> hath bred ſuch <hi>an earthquake</hi> and alteration amongſt many Nations; as <hi>a tenth part,</hi> or a good portion of theſe that were in ſubiection to <hi>that Great Citie,</hi>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:23110:181"/>to wit, <hi>Babylon,</hi> are fallen from her; <hi>ſeuen thouſand,</hi> that is, many thouſands <hi>hauing bene killed</hi> vpon the occaſion of that great alteration; and many other conuerted to the feare of GOD, <hi>and giuing glory to the God of heauen.</hi> This now is one of the wayes, by which (I thinke) this place of Scripture may be lawfully and probably interpreted.</p>
            <p>The other is more common, and ſeemeth more literally to agree with the Text. And this is to interpret, not the <hi>word of God,</hi> but the <hi>Preachers thereof</hi> to bee meant by theſe <hi>Witneſſes.</hi> Few they were that firſt began to reueale the man of <hi>Sinne,</hi> and diſcouer his corruptions; and therefore well deſcribed by the number of <hi>two Witneſſes:

               <hi>they roſe againe;</hi> and that in ſuch power and efficacie, as is more then miraculous: For where it is accounted in the Scriptures a miraculous worke of GOD wrought by his holy Spirit,
<note place="margin">Actes 2.41.</note> When the Apoſtle <hi>Saint Peter</hi> conuerted about three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in one day; theſe <hi>Witneſſes</hi> I ſpeake of, by the force of the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, conuerted many mightie Nations in few yeeres, who ſtill continue praiſing GOD, that hee hath deliuered vs from the tyrannie of Antichriſt, that reigneth ouer that great Citie; and with a full crie proclaiming, <hi>Goe out of her my people,

Thus hauing in two faſhions deliuered my coniecture, what I take to bee meant by theſe two <hi>Witneſſes</hi> in the xj. of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> there beeing no great difference betweene them: In the one, taking it to bee the Word of GOD it ſelfe; In the other, the Word of God too, but in the mouthes of his Preachers: It reſteth now that I come to the <hi>third</hi> point of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Antichrist;</hi> which is anent his <hi>Perſon.</hi>

            <p>That by the Whore of Babylon that rideth vpon the Beaſt, is meant a Seate of an Empire, and a ſucceſſiue number of men ſitting thereupon, and not any one man; doeth well appeare by the forme of the deſcription of the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> thorowout all the ſaid Booke.

<note place="margin">Verſe 9.</note> That that deſcription now of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> endeth there, it is more then plaine: for at the opening of the firſt Seale, the ſoules and blood of the murthered Saints cry for vengeance and haſting of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

Theſe Spirits indeed, thus ſent foorth by this three-fold authoritie for the defence of their Triple-crowned Monarch, are well likened to frogges; for they are <hi>Amphibions,</hi> and can liue in either Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, earth or water: for though they be Churchmen by profeſſion, yet can they vſe the trade of politique Stateſmen;

And that ſhee may the better bee knowen, hee writeth her name vpon her forehead agreeable to her qualities: A <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> that <hi>great Babylon, the Mother of whoredomes and abominations of the earth.</hi> A <hi>Mysterie</hi> is a name that belongeth vnto her two maner of wayes:
<note place="margin">Verſe 5.</note> One, as ſhee taketh it to her ſelfe; another, as ſhee deſerueth indeed.

And if the obſeruation of one be trew, that hee had of old the word <hi>Mysterie</hi> written on his Myter; then is this Prophecie very plainely accompliſhed.

            <p>Now after that this ſcarlet or bloody Beaſt and her Rider are deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, by their ſhape, garments name and qualities: the Angel doeth next interprete this viſion vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi> expounding vnto him what is ſignified both by the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>her Rider;</hi> telling him,

               <note place="margin">Verſe 12.</note> which hee ſheweth to be <hi>tenne Kings, that ſhall at one houre receiue their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and kingdome with the Beaſt,</hi> I take that number of <hi>ten</hi> to be <hi>Numerus cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus pro incerto;</hi> euen as the number of ſeuen heads and ten hornes vpon the Dragon the Deuill, cannot but be an vncertaine number.

<note place="margin">Verſe 12, 13.</note> And there he deſcribeth all ſorts of <hi>rich wares,</hi> whereof that great Citie was the Staple: for indeed ſhee hath a neceſſary vſe for all ſuch rich and glorious wares, as well for ornaments to her Churches and princely Prelates, as for garments and ornaments to her woodden Saints; for the <hi>bleſſed Virgin</hi> muſt be dayly clothed and decked in the neweſt and moſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious faſhion, though it ſhould reſemble the habit of a <hi>Curtizane.</hi> And of all thoſe rich wares,

               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:23110:186"/>Thus hath the <hi>Cardinals</hi> ſhameleſſe wreſting of thoſe two places of Scripture, <hi>Paſce oues meas,</hi> and <hi>Tibi dabo claues,</hi> for proouing of the Popes ſupreame Temporall authoritie ouer Princes; animated mee to prooue the Pope to bee THE ANTICHRIST, out of this foreſaid booke of Scripture; ſo to pay him in his owne money againe. And this opinion no Pope can euer make me to recant; except they firſt renounce any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther medling with Princes, in any thing belonging to their Temporall Iuriſdiction. And my onely wiſh ſhall bee, that if any man ſhall haue a fancie to refute this my coniecture of the <hi>Antichrist;</hi> that hee anſwere mee orderly to euery point of my diſcourſe; not contenting him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue my opinion, except hee ſet downe ſome other Methode after his forme for interpretation of that Booke of the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> which may not contradict no part of the Text, nor conteine no abſurdities: Otherwiſe, it is an eaſie thing for <hi>Momus</hi> to picke quarrels in another mans tale, and tell it worſe himſelfe; it being a more eaſie practiſe to finde faults, then amend them.</p>
            <p>Hauing now made this digreſſion anent the <hi>Antichrist,</hi> which I am ſure I can better faſten vpon the Pope, then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> can doe his pretended Temporall Superioritie ouer Kings: I will returne againe to ſpeake of this Anſwerer; who (as I haue already told you) ſo fitteth his matter with his manner of anſwering, that as his Style is nothing but a Satyre and heape full of iniurious and reprochfull ſpeaches, as well againſt my Perſon, as my Booke; ſo is his matter as full of lyes and falſities indeed, as hee vniuſtly layeth to my charge: For three lies hee maketh againſt the Oath of Alleagiance, conteined and maintained in my Booke; beſides that ordinary repeated lie againſt my Booke, of his omitting to anſwere my lyes, trattles, iniurious ſpeaches and blaſphemies. One groſſe lye he maketh euen of the Popes firſt <hi>Breue.</hi> One lye of the Puritanes, whom he would gladly haue to be of his partie. And one alſo of the Powder-Traitours, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent the occaſion that mooued them to vndertake that treaſonable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. Three lies hee makes of that Acte of Parliament wherein this Oath of Alleagiance is conteined. Hee alſo maketh one notable lie againſt his owne Catholike Writers. And two, of the cauſes for which two <hi>Ieſuites</hi> haue beene put to death in <hi>England.</hi> And he either falſifies, denies or wreſts fiue ſundry Hiſtories and a printed Pamphlet: beſides that impudent lye that hee maketh of my Perſon; that I was a Puritane in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which I haue already refuted. And for the better filling vp of his booke with ſuch good ſtuffe; hee hath alſo fiue ſo ſtrange and new principles of Diuinitie therein, as they are either new, or at leaſt allowed by very few of his owne Religion. All which lyes, with diuers others, and fiue ſtrange, and (as I thinke) erroneous points of Doctrine, with ſundry falſifications of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories; are ſet downe in a Table by themſelues in the end of this my Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, hauing their Refutation annexed to euery one of them.</p>
            <p>But as for the particular anſwering of his booke; it is both vnneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:23110:186"/>and vncomely for me to make a Reply. Vnneceſſary, becauſe (as I haue already told you) my Booke is neuer yet anſwered, ſo farre as belongeth to the maine queſtion anent the Oath of Alleagiance: the picking of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages vpon the wrong placing of the figures in the citations, or ſuch errors in the Print by caſuall addition, or omiſſion of words that make nothing to the Argument; being the greateſt weapons wherewith hee aſſaults my Booke. And vncomely it muſt needs be (in my opinion) for a <hi>King</hi> to fall in altercation with a <hi>Cardinal,</hi> at leaſt with one no more nobly deſcended then he is: That Eccleſiaſticall dignitie, though by the ſloath of Princes (as I ſaid before) it be now come to that height of vſurped honour, yet being in the trew originall and foundation thereof nothing elſe, but the title of the Prieſts and Deacons of the Pariſh Churches in the towne of <hi>Rome;</hi> at the firſt, the ſtile of <hi>Cardinals</hi> being generally giuen to all Prieſts and Deacons of any Cathedral Church, though the multitude of ſuch <hi>Cardinal</hi> Prieſts and Deacons reſorting to <hi>Rome,</hi> was the cauſe that after bred the reſtraining of that title of <hi>Cardinall</hi> Prieſts and Deacons, onely to the Pariſh-prieſts and Deacons of <hi>Rome.</hi> And ſince that it is <hi>S. Gregorie,</hi> who in his Epiſtles ſixe hundreth yeeres after CHRIST, maketh the firſt mention of <hi>Cardinals</hi> (and ſo theſe now <hi>Electours</hi> of the Apoſtolike Sea, beeing long and many hundreth yeeres vnknowen or vnheard of, after the Apoſtolik aage; and yet doeth hee ſpeake of them but in this ſence as I haue now deſcribed) I hope the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> who calleth him the <hi>Apostle</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> cannot blame mee that am King thereof, to acknowledge the <hi>Cardinall</hi> in no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of honour, then our ſaid Apoſtle did. But how they ſhould now become to bee ſo ſtrangely exalted aboue their firſt originall inſtitution, that from Pariſh-prieſts and Deacons (Prieſts inferiours) they ſhould now come to bee Princes and Peeres to Kings; and from a degree vnder Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops (as both

But the ſpeciall harme they do vs, is by their defrauding vs of our common &amp; Chriſtian intereſt in General Councels; they hauing (as I ſaid) vtterly aboliſhed the ſame, by rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it vp, &amp; making as it were a Monopoly thereof, in their Conclaue with the Pope. Whereas, if euer there were a poſſibilitie to be expected of redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all Chriſtians to an vniformitie of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it muſtcome by the means of a Generall Councel: the place of their meeting being choſen ſo indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as all Chriſtian Princes, either in their owne Perſons, or their Deputie
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:23110:187"/>Commiſſioners, and all Church-men of Chriſtian profeſſion that beleeue and profeſſe all the ancient grounds of the trew, ancient, Catholike, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike Faith, might haue <hi>tutum acceſſum</hi> thereunto; All the incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Noueliſt fire-brands on either ſide being debarred from the ſame, as well <hi>Ieſuites</hi> as <hi>Puritanes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore hauing reſolued not to paine my ſelfe with making a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie for theſe reaſons heere ſpecified, grounded as well vpon the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the matter, as of the perſon of the Anſwerer; I haue thought good to content my ſelfe with the reprinting of my <hi>Apologie:</hi> hauing in a manner corrected nothing but the Copiers or Printers faults therein, and prefixed this my Epiſtle of Dedication and Warning thereunto; that I may yet ſee, if any thing will be iuſtly ſaid againſt it: Not doubting but enow of my Subiects will replie vpon theſe Libellers, and anſwere them ſufficiently; wiſhing YOV deepely to conſider, and weigh your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt in this Cauſe. For neither in all my <hi>Apologie,</hi> nor in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Refutation thereof, is there any queſtion made anent the Popes power ouer mee in particular, for the excommunicating or depoſing of mee: For in my particular; the Cardinall doeth mee that grace, that hee ſaith, The Pope thought it not expedient at this time to excommunicate mee by name; our queſtion being onely generall, Whether the Pope may lawfully pretend any temporall power ouer Kings, or no?</p>
            <p>That no Church-men can by his rule bee ſubiect to any Temporall Prince, I haue already ſhewed you; And what Obedience any of you may looke for of any of them <hi>de facto,</hi> hee plainely forewarneth you of, by the example of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great his obedience to the Emperour <hi>Mauritius:</hi> not being aſhamed to ſlaunder that great Perſonages Chriſtian humilitie and Obedience to the Emperour, with the title of a conſtrained and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced obedience, becauſe hee might, or durſt doe no otherwiſe. Whereby he not onely wrongs the ſaid <hi>Gregory</hi> in particular, but euen doeth by that meanes lay on an heauie ſlaunder and reproach vpon the Chriſtian humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and patience of the whole Primitiue Church, eſpecially in the time of perſecution: if the whole glory of their Martyrdome and Chriſtian patience ſhall bee thus blotted with that vile gloſſe of their coacted and conſtrained ſuffering, becauſe they could or durſt doe no otherwiſe; like the patience and obedience of the Iewes or Turkiſh ſlaues in our time, cleane contrary to <hi>Saint Paul</hi> and <hi>Saint Peters</hi> doctrine of obedience for conſcience ſake;
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.5. 1. Pet. 2.13.</note> and as contrary to <hi>Tertullians Apologie</hi> for Chriſtians, and all the proteſtations of the ancient Fathers in that caſe. But it was good lucke for the ancient Chriſtians in the dayes of Ethnicke Emperours, that this prophane and new conceit was then vnknowen among them: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they would haue beene vtterly deſtroyed and rooted out in that time, and no man to haue pitied them, as moſt dangerous members in a Common-wealth; who would no longer be obedient, then till they were furniſhed with ſufficient abilitie and power to reſiſt and rebell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:23110:187"/>Thus may ye ſee, how vpon the one part our <hi>Cardinall</hi> will haue all Kings and Monarchs to bee the <hi>Popes Vaſſals;</hi> and yet will not on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, allow the meaneſt of the <hi>Pope</hi> his vaſſals, to be ſubiect to any Chriſtian Prince. But he not thinking it enough to make the <hi>Pope</hi> our Superior, hath in a late Treatiſe of his (called the <hi>Recognition of his bookes of Controuerſies</hi>) made the people and Subiects of euery one of vs, our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors. For hauing taken occaſion to reuiſite againe his bookes of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies, and to correct or explaine what he findeth amiſſe or miſtaketh in them; in imitation of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> his retractions (for ſo he ſaith in his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>) he doth in place of retracting any of his former errours, or any matter of ſubſtance; not retract, but <hi>recant</hi> indeed, I meane ſing ouer againe, and obſtinatly confirme a number of the groſſeſt of them: Among the which, the exempting of all Church-men from ſubiection to any Temporall Prince, and the ſetting vp not onely of the <hi>Pope,</hi> but euen of the People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue their naturall King; are two of his maine points.</p>
            <p>As for the exemption of the Clerickes; he is ſo greedy there to proue that point, as he denieth <hi>Caeſar</hi> to haue beene <hi>Pauls</hi> lawfull Iudge:
<note place="margin">Acts. 25.10.</note> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the expreſſe Text, and <hi>Pauls</hi> plaine Appellation, and acknowledging him his Iudge; beſides his many times claiming to the Roman priuiledges,
<note place="margin">Actes 22.28.</note> and auowing himſelfe a Roman by freedome; and therefore of neceſſitie a Subiect to the Roman Emperour. But it is a wonder that theſe <hi>Romane Catholikes,</hi> who vaunt themſelues of the ancientie both of their doctrine and Church, and reproch vs ſo bitterly of our Nouelties, ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to make ſuch a new inept gloſſe as this vpon S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Text; which as it is directly contrary to the Apoſtles wordes, ſo is it without any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, either of any ancient <hi>Councell,</hi> or of ſo much as any one particular <hi>Father</hi> that euer interprets that place in this ſort: Neither was it euer doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any Chriſtian in the Primitiue Church, that the Apoſtles, or any other degree of Chriſtians, were ſubiect to the Emperour.</p>
            <p>And as for the ſetting vp of the People aboue their owne naturall King, he bringeth in that principle of Sedition, that he may thereby proue, that Kings haue not their power and authoritie immediatly from God, as the Pope hath his: For euery King (ſaith he) is made and choſen by his people; nay, they doe but ſo transferre their power in the Kings perſon, as they doe notwithſtanding retaine their habituall power in their owne hands, which vpon certaine occaſions they may actually take to themſelues againe. This, I am ſure, is an excellent ground in Diuinitie for all Rebels and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious people, who are hereby allowed to rebell againſt their Princes; and aſſume libertie vnto themſelues, when in their diſcretions they ſhall thinke it conuenient.</p>
            <p>And amongſt his other Teſtimonies for probation, that all Kings are made and created by the People; he alledgeth the Creation of three Kings in the Scripture, <hi>Saul, Dauid</hi> and <hi>Ieroboam;</hi> and though hee bee compelled by the expreſſe words of the Text, to confeſſe, that God by his
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:23110:188"/>Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> annointed both
<note n="1" place="margin">1. Sam. 10.1</note> 
               <hi>Saul</hi> and
<note n="2" place="margin">1. Sam. 16.12.13.</note> 
               <hi>Dauid;</hi> yet will he, by the poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſent of the people, proue that thoſe Kings were not immediatly made by God, but mediatly by the people; though he repeat thriſe that word of <hi>Lott,</hi> by the caſting whereof he confeſſeth that <hi>Saul</hi> was choſen. And if the Election by <hi>Lott</hi> be not an immediate Election from God; then was not <hi>Matthias,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Actes 1.</note> who was ſo choſen and made an Apoſtle, immediatly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by GOD: and conſequently, he that ſitteth in the Apoſtolike Sea can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not for ſhame claime to be immediatly choſen by God, if <hi>Matthias</hi> (that was one of the twelue Apoſtles, ſupplying <hi>Iudas</hi> his place) was not ſo cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. But as it were a blaſphemous impietie, to doubt that <hi>Matthias</hi> was immediatly choſen by GOD, and yet was hee choſen by the caſting of Lots, as <hi>Saul</hi> was: ſo is it well enough knowen to ſome of you (my louing <hi>Brethren</hi>) by what holy Spirit or caſting of Lots the <hi>Popes</hi> vſe to be elected; the Colledge of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> his electors, hauing beene diuided in two mightie factions euer ſince long before my time; and in place of caſting of Lotts, great fat penſions beeing caſt into ſome of their greedy mouthes for the election of the <hi>Pope,</hi> according to the partiall humours of Princes. But I doe moſt of all wonder at the weakeneſſe of his memorie: for in this place he maketh the poſt-conſent of the people to be the thing that made both theſe Kings, notwithſtanding of their preceding inauguration and anoyntment by the Prophet at GODS commandement; forgetting that in the beginning of this ſame little booke of his, anſwering one that alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth a ſentence of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> to prooue that the Biſhops were iudged by the people in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, he there confeſſeth, that by theſe words, the <hi>conſent of the people</hi> to the Biſhops Election muſt be onely vnderſtood. Nor will he there any wayes be mooued to graunt, that the peoples power, in conſenting to or refuſing the Election of a Biſhop, ſhould be ſo vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as that thereby they haue <hi>power to elect Biſhops:</hi> And yet do theſe words of <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſeeme to bee farre ſtronger, for granting the peoples power to elect Churchmen, then any words that he alledgeth out of the Scripture are for the peoples power in electing a King. For the very words of <hi>Cyprian</hi> by himſelfe there cited,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cyprian. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4.</note> are, That <hi>the very people haue prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally the power, either to chuſe ſuch Prieſts as are worthy, or to refuſe ſuch as are vnworthie:</hi> And, I hope, hee can neuer prooue by the Scripture, that it had beene lawfull to the people of Iſrael, or that it was left in their choiſe, to haue admitted or refuſed <hi>Saul</hi> or <hi>Dauid</hi> at their pleaſure, after that the Prophet had anoynted them, and perſented them vnto them.</p>
            <p>Thus ye ſee how little he careth (euen in ſo little a volume) to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelfe, ſo it may make for his purpoſe; making the <hi>conſent</hi> of the people to ſignifie their <hi>power of Election</hi> in the making of Kings: though in the making of Biſhops, by the peoples <hi>conſent,</hi> their <hi>approbation</hi> of a deed done by others muſt onely be vnderſtood. And as for his example of <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams</hi> election to bee King;
<note place="margin">1 King. 12.20.</note> hee knoweth well enough, that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was made King in a popular mutinous tumult and rebellion; onely
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:23110:188"/>permitted by God, and that in his wrath, both againſt theſe two Kings and their people. But if he will needs helpe himſelfe, againſt all rules of Diuinitie, with ſuch an extraordinary example for proofe of a generall Rule; why is it not as lawfull for vs Kings to oppoſe hereunto the example of <hi>Iehu</hi> his Inauguration to the Kingdome;
<note place="margin">2. King. 9.2, 3.</note> who vpon the Prophets priuat anointment of him, and that in moſt ſecret manner, tooke preſently the Kings office vpon him, without euer crauing any ſort of approbation from the people?</p>
            <p>And thus may ye now clearely ſee, how deepe the claime of the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Monarch toucheth vs in all our common intereſt: for (as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told) the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor any of his Vaſſals, I meane Church-men muſt be ſubiect to no Kings nor Princes: and yet all Kings and their Vaſſals muſt not onely be ſubiect to the Pope, but euen to their owne people. And now, what a large libertie is by this doctrine left to Church-men, to hatch or foſter any treaſonable attempts againſt Princes; I leaue it to your conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, ſince do what they will, they are accountable to none of vs: nay, all their treaſonable practiſes muſt be accounted workes of pietie, and they (being iuſtly puniſhed for the ſame) muſt be preſently inrolled in the liſt of Martyrs and Saints; like as our new printed Martyrologie hath put <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Ouldcorne</hi> in the Regiſter of Engliſh <hi>Martyrs</hi> abroad, that were hanged at home for <hi>Treaſon</hi> againſt the Crowne and whole State of <hi>England:</hi> ſo as I may iuſtly with <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> pronounce a <hi>Woe to them that ſpeake good of euill,
<note place="margin">Iſai 5.20.</note> and euill of good; which put light for darkeneſſe, and darkeneſse for light;
<note place="margin">Verſe 23.</note> which iuſtifie the wicked for are ward, and take away the righteouſnes of the righteous from him.</hi> For euen as in the time of the greateſt blindneſſe in Popery, though a man ſhould find his wife or his daughter lying a bed in her Confeſſors armes; yet was it not lawfull for him ſo much as to ſuſpect that the Frier had any errand there, but to Confeſſe and inſtruct her: Euen ſo, though <hi>Ieſuites</hi> practiſing in Treaſon be ſufficiently verified, and that themſelues cannot but confeſſe it; yet muſt they be accounted to ſuffer <hi>Martyrdome</hi> for the Faith, and their blood worke miracles, and frame a <hi>ſtramineum argumentum</hi> vpon ſtrawes; when their heads are ſtanding aloft, withered by the Sunne and the winde, a publike ſpectacle for the eternall commemoration of their treacherie. Yea, one of the reaſons, that is giuen in the Printers Epiſtle of the <hi>Colonian</hi> edition of the Cardinall or his Chaplains pamphlet, why he doth the more willingly print it, is; becauſe that the innocencie of that moſt holy and conſtant man <hi>Henry Garnet,</hi> is declared and ſet forth in that booke; againſt whom, ſome <hi>(he knew not who)</hi> had ſcattered a falſe rumour of his guiltineſſe of the Engliſh treaſon.</p>
            <p>But, Lord, what an impudencie or wilfull ignorance is this, that he, who was ſo publikely and ſolemnely conuicted and executed, vpon his owne ſo cleare, vnforced and often repeated confeſſion, of his knowledge and concealing of that horrible Treaſon, ſhould now be ſaid to haue a certaine rumor ſpred vpon him of his guiltineſſe, by <hi>I know not who?</hi> with ſo many
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:23110:189"/>attributes of godlineſſe, conſtancie and innocencie beſtowed vpon him, as if publike Sentences and Executions of Iuſtice, were rumors of <hi>I know not who.</hi> Indeed, I muſt confeſſe, the booke it ſelfe ſheweth a great affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to performe, what is thus promiſed in the Preface thereof: for in two or three places therein, is there moſt honorable lying mention made of that ſtraw-Saint; wherein, though he confeſſe that <hi>Garnet</hi> was vpon the foreknowledge of the Powder-Treaſon, yet in regard it was (as he ſaith) onely vnder the Seale of Confeſſion, he ſticketh not to praiſe him for his concealing thereof, and would gladly giue him the crowne of glory for the ſame: not being aſhamed to proclaime it as a principall head of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique doctrine; <hi>That the ſecret of Sacramentall confeſsion ought not to be reuealed, not for the eſchewing of whatſoeuer euill.</hi> But how damnable this doctrine is, and how dangerouſly preiudiciall to all Princes and States; I leaue it to you to iudge, whom all it moſt highly concerneth. For although it bee trew, that when the Schoolemen came to be Doctors in the Church, and to marre the old grounds in Diuinitie by ſowing in among them their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophicall diſtinctions; though they (I ſay) do maintaine, That whatſoeuer thing is told a Confeſſor vnder the vaile of confeſſion, how dangerous ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the matter be, yet he is bound to conceale the parties name: yet doe none of them, I meane of the old Schoolemen, deny; that if a matter be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto them, the concealing whereof may breed a great or publike danger; but that in that caſe the Confeſſor may diſcloſe the matter, though not the perſon, and by ſome indirect means make it come to light, that the danger thereof may be preuented. But that no treaſon nor deuiliſh plot, though it ſhould tend to the ruine or exterminion of a whole Kingdome, muſt be reuealed, if it be told vnder Confeſſion, no not the matter ſo farre indirectly diſcloſed, as may giue occaſion for preuenting the danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: though it agree with the conceit of ſome three or foure new <hi>Ieſuited</hi> Doctors, it is ſuch a new and dangerous head of doctrine, as no King nor State can liue in ſecuritie where that Poſition is maintained.</p>
            <p>And now, that I may as well prooue him a lyar <hi>in facto,</hi> in his narration of this particular Hiſtory; as I haue ſhewed him to be <hi>in iure,</hi> by this his damnable and falſe ground in Diuinity: I will trewly informe you of <hi>Garnets</hi> caſe, which is farre otherwiſe then this Anſwerer alleadgeth. For firſt, it can neuer be accounted a thing vnder Confeſſion, which he that reueals it doth not diſcouer with a remorſe, accounting it a ſinne whereof hee repenteth him; but by the contrary, diſcouers it as a good motion, and is therein not diſſuaded by his Confeſſor, nor any penance enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him for the ſame: and in this forme was this Treaſon reuealed to <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> as himſelfe confeſſed. And next, though he ſtood long vpon it, that it was reuealed vnto him vnder the vaile of Confeſſion, in reſpect it was done in that time, while as the partie was making his Confeſſion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; Yet at the laſt hee did freely confeſſe, that the party reuealed it vnto him as they were walking, and not in the time of Confeſſion: But
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:23110:189"/>(he ſaid) he deliuered it vnto him vnder the greateſt Seale that might bee, and ſo he tooke that he meant by the Seale of Confeſſion; And it had (as he thought) a relation to Confeſſion, in regard that hee was that parties Confeſſor, and had taken his Confeſſion ſometimes before, and was to take it againe within few dayes thereafter. He alſo ſaid, that he pretended to the partie, that he would not conceale it from his Superior. And further it is to be noted, that he confeſſed, that two diuers perſons conferred with him anent this Treaſon; and that when the one of them which was <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesby,</hi> conferred with him thereupon, it was in the other parties preſence and hearing: and what a Confeſſion can this be in the hearing of a third perſon? And how farre his laſt words (whereof our Anſwerer ſo much vaunts him) did diſproue it to haue bene vnder Confeſſion, the Earle of Northamptons booke doeth beare witneſſe.</p>
            <p>Now as to the other parties name, that reuealed the Powder-Treaſon vnto him, it was <hi>Greenewell</hi> the <hi>Ieſuite;</hi> and ſo a <hi>Ieſuite</hi> reuealed to a <hi>Ieſuite</hi> this Treaſonable plot, the <hi>Ieſuite</hi> reuealer not ſhewing any remorſe, and the <hi>Ieſuite</hi> whom-to it was reuealed not ſo much as enioyning him any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the ſame. And that ye may know that more <hi>Ieſuits</hi> were alſo vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the partie, <hi>Owldcorne</hi> the other Powder-Martyr, after the miſgiuing and diſcouery of that Treaſon, preached conſolatory doctrine to his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique auditorie; exhorting them not to faint for the miſgiuing of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, nor to thinke the worſe thereof that it ſucceeded not; alleadging diuers Preſidents of ſuch godly enterpriſes that miſgaue in like maner: eſpecially, one of <hi>S. Lewes</hi> King of France, who in his ſecond iourney to the <hi>Holy-land</hi> died by the way, the greateſt part of his armie being deſtroyed by the plague; his firſt iourney hauing likewiſe miſgiuen him by the <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dans</hi> taking of him: exhorting them thereupon not to giue ouer, but ſtill to hope that GOD would bleſſe their enterpriſe at ſome other time, though this did faile.</p>
            <p>Thus ſee ye now, with what boldneſſe and impudencie hee hath belied the publiquely knowne veritie in this errand; both in auowing generally that no <hi>Ieſuite</hi> was any wayes guiltie of that Treaſon, for ſo he affirmeth in his booke; and alſo that <hi>Garnet</hi> knew nothing thereof, but vnder the Seale of Confeſſion. But if this were the firſt lye of the affaires of this State, which my fugitiue Prieſts and Ieſuits haue coyned and ſpread abroad, I could charme them of it, as the prouerbe is. But as well the walles of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Monaſteries and <hi>Ieſuites</hi> Colledges abroad, are filled with the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſuch lying Hiſtories, as alſo the bookes of our ſaid fugitiues are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with ſuch ſort of ſhameleſſe ſtuffe; ſuch are the innumerable ſorts of torments and cruell deathes, that they record their Martyrs to haue ſuffred here, ſome torne at foure Horſes; ſome ſowed in Beares skinnes, and then killed with Dogges; nay, women haue not bene ſpared (they ſay) and a thouſand other ſtrange fictions; the vanities of all which I will in two words diſcouer vnto you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:23110:190"/>Firſt, as for the cauſe of their puniſhment, I doe conſtantly maintaine that which I haue ſaid in my <hi>Apologie:</hi> That no man, either in my time, or in the late <hi>Queenes,</hi> euer died here for his conſcience. For let him be neuer ſo deuout a Papiſt, nay, though he profeſſe the ſame neuer ſo conſtantly, his life is in no danger by the Law, if hee breake not out into ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acte expreſly againſt the words of the Law; or plot not ſome vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or dangerous practiſe or attempt; Prieſts and Popiſh Church-men onely excepted, that receiue Orders beyond the Seas; who for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold treaſonable practiſes that they haue kindled and plotted in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, are diſcharged to come home againe vnder paine of Treaſon, after their receiuing of the ſaid Orders abroad; and yet, without ſome other guilt in them then their bare home-comming, haue none of them bene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer put to death. And next, for the cruell torments and ſtrange ſorts of death that they ſay ſo many of them haue bene put vnto; if there were no more but the Law and continually obſerued cuſtome of England, theſe many hundred yeeres, in all criminall matters, it will ſufficiently ſerue to refute all theſe monſtrous lies: for no tortures are euer vſed here, but the Manacles or the Racke, and theſe neuer but in caſes of high Treaſon; and all ſorts of Traitours die but one maner of death here, whether they be Papiſt or Proteſtant Traitors; Queene <hi>Maries</hi> time onely excepted. For then indeede no ſorts of cruell deathes were ſpared vnexecuted vpon men, women and children profeſſing our Religion: yea, euen againſt the Lawes of God and Nature, women with childe were put to cruell death for their profeſſion; and a liuing childe falling out of the mothers belly, was throwen in the ſame fire againe that conſumed the mother. But theſe tyrannous perſecutions were done by the Biſhops of that time, vnder the warrant of the Popes authoritie; and therefore were not ſubiect to that conſtant order and formes of execution, which as they are heere eſtabliſhed by our Lawes and cuſtomes, ſo are they accordingly obſerued in the puniſhment of all criminals: For all Prieſtes and Popiſh Traitours here receiue their Iudgements in the temporall Courts, and ſo doe neuer exceed thoſe formes of execution which are preſcribed by the Law, or approued by continuall cuſtome. One thing is alſo to bee marked in this caſe that ſtrangers are neuer called in queſtion here for their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is farre otherwiſe (I hope) in any place where the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> domines.</p>
            <p>But hauing now too much wearied you with this long diſcourſe, whereby I haue made you plainely ſee, that the wrong done vnto mee in particular firſt by the <hi>Popes Breues,</hi> and then by theſe Libellers, doth as deepely intereſt you all in generall, that are <hi>Kings,</hi> free <hi>Princes,</hi> or <hi>States</hi> as it doth me in particular: I will now conclude, with my humble prayers to God, that he will waken vs vp all out of that Lethargike ſlumber of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, wherein our Predeceſſors and wee haue lien ſo long; and that wee may firſt grauely conſider, what we are bound in conſcience to doe for the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:23110:190"/>planting and ſpreading of the trew worſhip of God, according to his reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will, in all our Dominions; therein hearing the voice of our onely Paſtor (<hi>for his Sheepe will know his Voyce,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 10.27.</note> as himſelfe ſayeth) and not following the vaine, corrupt and changeable traditions of men. And next, that we may prouidently looke to the ſecuritie of our owne States, and not ſuffer this incroching <hi>Babylonian Monarch</hi> to winne ſtill ground vpon vs. And if GOD hath ſo mercifully dealt with vs, that are his Lieutenants vpon earth, as that he hath ioyned his cauſe with our intereſt, the ſpirituall libertie of the Goſpell with our temporall freedome: with what zeale and courage may wee then imbrace this worke: for our labours herein being aſſured, to receiue at the laſt the eternall and ineſtimable reward of felicitie in the kingdome of Heauen; and in the meane time to procure vnto our ſelues a temporall ſecuritie, in our temporall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in this world.</p>
            <p>As for ſo many of you as are alreadie perſwaded of that Trewth which I profeſſe, though differing among your ſelues in ſome particular points; I thinke little perſwaſion ſhould moue you to this holy and wiſe Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Our Greatneſſe, nor our number, praiſed bee GOD, being not ſo contemptible, but that wee may ſhew good example to our neighbors; ſince almoſt the halfe of all Chriſtian people and of all ſorts and degrees, are of our profeſſion; I meane, all gone out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> euen from Kings and free Princes, to the meaneſt ſort of People. But aboue all (my lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Coſins</hi>) keepe faſt the vnity of Faith among your ſelues; Reiect

            <p>And as for you (my louing <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Coſins</hi>) whom it hath not yet pleaſed GOD to illuminate with the light of his trewth; I can but humbly pray with <hi>Elizeus,</hi> that it would pleaſe GOD to open your eyes, that yee might ſee what innumerable and inuincible armies of Angels are euer prepared and ready to defend the trewth of GOD:
<note place="margin">Actes. 26.29.</note> and with <hi>S. Paul</hi> I wiſh, that ye were as I am in this caſe; eſpecially that yee would ſearch the Scriptures, and ground your Faith vpon your owne certaine knowledge, and not vpon the report of others;
<note place="margin">Abac. 2.4.</note> ſince euery <hi>Man must bee ſafe by his owne faith.</hi> But, leauing this to GOD his mercifull prouidence in his due time, I haue good reaſon to remember you, to maintaine the ancient liberties of your Crownes and Common-wealthes, not ſuffering any vnder GOD to ſet himſelfe vp aboue you; and therein to imitate your owne noble <hi>prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,</hi> who (euen in the dayes of greateſt blindneſſe) did diuers times coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly oppoſe themſelues to the incroaching ambition of Popes. Yea,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:23110:191"/>ſome of your Kingdomes haue in all aages maintained, and without any interruption enioyed your libertie, againſt the moſt ambitious Popes. And ſome haue of very late had an euident proofe of the Popes ambitious aſpiring ouer your Temporall power; wherein ye haue conſtantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and defended your lawfull freedome, to your immortall honour. And therefore I heartily wiſh you all, to doe in this caſe the Office of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and iuſt Kings and earthly Iudges: which conſiſteth not onely in not wronging or inuading the Liberties of any other perſon (for to that will I neuer preſſe to perſwade you) but alſo in defending and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe lawfull Liberties wherewith GOD hath indued you: For yee, whom GOD hath ordained to protect your people from iniuries, ſhould be aſhamed to ſuffer your ſelues to be wronged by any. And thus, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my ſelfe, that ye will with a ſetled Iudgement, free of preiudice, weigh the reaſons of this my <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> and accept my plainneſſe in good part, gracing this my <hi>Apologie</hi> with your fauours, and yet no longer then till it ſhall be iuſtly and worthily refuted; I end, with my earneſt prayers to the ALMIGHTIE for your proſperities, and that after your happie Temporall Raignes in earth, ye may liue and raigne in Heauen with him for euer.</p>

                     <p>You ſhall repaire to the<hi> States Generall, </hi>with all poſsible diligence in our name, telling them, that wee doubt not, but that their Ambaſſadours which were with vs about two yeeres ſince, did informe them of a forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that we wiſhed the ſaid Ambaſſadours to make vnto them in our name, to beware in time, of ſeditious and hereticall Preachers, and not to ſuffer any ſuch to creepe into their State. Our principall meaning was of<hi> Arminius, </hi>who though himſelfe were lately dead, yet had hee left too many of his diſciples behinde him. Now according to that care which wee continually haue of the weale of their State, wee haue thought good to ſend vnto them a new aduertiſement vpon the like occaſion, which is this: That there is lately come to our handes a piece of worke of one<hi> Vorſtius, </hi>a Diuine in thoſe parts, wherein hee hath publiſhed ſuch monstrous blasphemie and horrible Atheiſme, as out of the care that a Chriſtian Prince, and Defender of the Faith, (as we haue euer bene) ought to haue of the good of the Church, wee hold not onely ſuch a ſcandalous booke worthy to bee burnt, but euen the Authour himſelfe to bee most ſeuerely puniſhed. This not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding wee are informed, that the States are ſo farre from beeing ſenſible of ſo great a ſcandall to the Church, as that the moſt part of them haue already yeelded him their free conſents and voyces, for the obteining of the place of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie Reader in the Vniuerſitie of<hi> Leyden, </hi>which the aboue-named<hi> Arminius </hi>of little better ſtuffe, lately enioyed: and though himſelfe be dead, hath left his ſting yet liuing among them. Hauing therefore vnderſtood, that the time of Election will be about Michaelmas next, and holding our ſelues bound in honour and conſcience, as a Chriſtian Prince, and one who hath vouchſafed the States our Royall fauour and ſupport in respect of their Religion, to preuent ſo great a miſchiefe ſo farre as we are able: Wee will and require you to let them vnderſtand, how infinitely wee ſhall bee displeaſed if ſuch a Monſter receiue aduancement in the Church. And if it bee alleadged, that hee hath recanted his Atheisticall opinions, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he may be capable of the place, you ſhall tell them, that wee thinke his Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſo ſlender a ſatisfaction for ſo fowle an offence, as that wee hold him rather worthy of puniſhment, or at leaſt to be debarred from all promotion: Wherein though
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:23110:197"/>wee aſsure our ſelfe, that they will of their owne diſcretions eſchew ſuch a viper, who may make a fearefull rent not onely in their Eccleſiaſticall, but alſo in their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique State, yet notwithſtanding all this, if they will continue their reſolution to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre him, you ſhall then make a proteſtation to them in our name, That wee will not faile to make knowen to the world publikely in print, how much wee deteſt ſuch abominable Hereſies, and all allowers and tolerators of them: And becauſe the States ſhall know vpon what reaſons we haue grounded this our Admonition, you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue herewith a

               <p>For obſeruing, that ſo prodigious a Monſter began to liue among them, We could do no leſſe (conſidering the infinite obligations which wee owe vnto God) then to make Our zeale appeare againſt ſuch an enemie to the Eſſence of the Deity. Beſides, the charitie, which Wee beare to the ſaid States Our neighbors and Confederates, profeſſing the ſame Religion that we do, did enforce Vs to admoniſh them, to eſchew and preuent in time ſo dangerous a contagion, which diſperſing it ſelfe, might infect, not onely the bodie of their State, but all Chriſtendome alſo; the danger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was ſo much greater to our Dominions then to many others, by how much the <hi>Prouinces</hi> of the ſaid States are neerer vnto Vs in their ſituation.</p>
               <p>Our Ambaſſadour therefore hauing ſufficiently acquitted himſelfe of that which Wee gaue him in charge, by exhorting them in Our Name, timely to preuent the danger which might enſue by enterteyning ſuch a gueſt as VORSTIVS; (which at that time they might eaſily haue done, ſeeing he was not yet ſetled at <hi>Leyden,</hi> neither was he lodged in the houſe appointed for the publique Reader, nor were his wife and family yet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued, and therefore much more eaſie for them to haue rid him out of their countrey, ſending him backe to the place from whence he came, according to the old Prouerbe,</p>

(<hi>who were of the first</hi> Counts <hi>that in</hi> Germanie <hi>had cast off the yoke of the</hi> Papacie, <hi>Idolatrie, and impure religion, and imbraced the reformed Religion, which to this day they maintaine) there did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine one</hi> Doct. Conradus Vorſtius, <hi>who had continued in that place about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeeres a</hi> Profeſſor <hi>of trew Religion, and a Minister; and that the ſaide</hi> Conradus Vorſtius <hi>for his learning and other good parts was much ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by</hi> Prince Maurice, Lantgraue <hi>of</hi> Heſſen, <hi>with intent to make him</hi> Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Profeſſor <hi>in ſome</hi> Vniuerſitie <hi>of his Countrey.

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:23110:198"/>in the holy knowledge of Diuinity, againſt the renowned</hi> Ieſuite Bellarmine: <hi>And that the ſayd</hi> Conradus Vorſtius <hi>was thereupon ſent for by the</hi> Curators <hi>aforeſayde, about the beginning of Iuly,</hi> 1610. <hi>which meſſage beeing ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by letters of recommendation from his</hi> Excellencie, <hi>and from the deputy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celors for the States of</hi> Holland <hi>and</hi> Weſtfrizeland, <hi>vnto the ſayd Counts of</hi> Tecklenburg, <hi>did accordingly take effect. In the moneth of Auguſt following, the ſaid Election and Calling was countermined by certaine perſons, to whoſe office or diſpoſition the buſineſſe did nothing at all belong: which being perceiued, and the ſayd</hi> Vorſtius <hi>charged with ſome vnſoundneſſe of doctrine, the</hi> Curators <hi>did thereupon thinke fit, with the good liking of</hi> Vorſtius <hi>himſelfe, that as well in the Vniuerſitie of</hi> Leyden, <hi>as at the</hi> Hage, <hi>he ſhould appeare in his owne iuſtification to anſwere all accuſers and accuſations whatſoeuer. At which time there was not any one that did offer to charge him. In the moneth of May following, ſixe Miniſters did vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to prooue, that</hi> VORSTIVS <hi>had publiſhed falſe and vnſound doctrine, who afterward beeing heard in full aſſembly of the States of</hi> Holland <hi>and</hi> Weſtfrize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, (<hi>in the preſence of the</hi> Curators, <hi>and ſixe other Ministers) on the one part, and</hi> Vorſtius <hi>in his owne defence on the other part; and that which could bee ſaid on either ſide to the ſeuerall points in their ſeuer all refutations respectiuely: The ſaid Lords States hauing grauely deliberated vpon the allegations as well of the one part as of the other, as alſo heard the opinions of the ſaid Ministers (after the maner and cuſtome of the ſayd aſſembly) could not ſee any reaſon, why the execution of that which was done by the</hi> Curators <hi>lawfully, and according to order, ought to bee hindred for impeached. In Auguſt following there being ſent ouer hither certaine other</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, <hi>wherewith</hi> Vorſtius <hi>was charged, and diſperſed in little printed Pamphlets amongſt the people, the ſayd Lords States entred into a new conſultation, and there reſolued, that</hi> Vorſtius <hi>(according both to Gods Law, the Law of Nature, and the law written; as alſo according to the laudable vſe and cuſtomes of their country,) ſhould be heard againſt his new accuſers, concerning thoſe</hi> Articles <hi>there layed to his charge. And moreouer, it was generally declared by the States of</hi> Holland <hi>and</hi> Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frizeland <hi>there aſſembled, (as euery one of them likewiſe in his owne particular, and the</hi> Curators <hi>and</hi> Bourgmaſters <hi>of</hi> Leyden <hi>for their parts did ſpecially declare:) That there was neuer any intention to permit other Religion to bee taught in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity of</hi> Leyden, <hi>then the Chriſtian Religion reformed and grounded vpon the word of God: And beſides, that if the ſayd</hi> Vorſtius <hi>ſhould bee found guilty in any of the aforeſayd points whereof hee was accuſed, that they would not admit him to the place of Profeſſour. The Deputies of the ſayd Lords States of</hi> Holland <hi>and</hi> Weſtfrizeland <hi>further declaring, that they doe aſsuredly beleeue, that if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty of</hi> Great Britaine <hi>were well informed of the trew circumſtances of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and of their ſincere intention therein, hee would (according to his high wiſedome, prudence, and benignitie) conceiue fauourably of them, and their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings: whereof the Lords States Generall are no leſſe confident; and the rather, for that the ſaid Deputies haue aſsured them, that the Lords States of</hi> Holland <hi>and</hi> Weſtfrizeland <hi>their Superiors would proceede in this buſineſse (as in all others) with all due reuerence, care, and respect vnto his Maieſties ſerious admonition, as becommeth them.</hi>

And about the ſame time one <hi>Bertius,</hi> a ſcholler of the late <hi>Arminius,</hi> (who was the firſt in our aage that infected <hi>Leyden</hi> with Hereſie) was ſo impudent, as to ſend a Letter vnto the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with a Booke intituled, <hi>De Apoſtaſia Sanctorum.</hi> And not thinking it ſufficient to auow the ſending of ſuch a booke, (the title whereof onely, were enough to make it worthy the fire) hee was moreouer ſo ſhameleſſe, as to maintaine in his Letter to the Archbiſhop, that the doctrine conteined in his booke, was agreeable with the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Let the Church of CHRIST then iudge, whether it was not high time for vs to beſtirre our ſelues, when as this Gangrene had not onely taken holde amongſt our neereſt neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; ſo as <hi>Nonſolùm paries proximus iam ardebat:</hi> not onely the next houſe was on fire, but did alſo begin to creepe into the bowels of our owne Kindome; For which cauſe hauing firſt giuen order, that the ſaid bookes of <hi>Vorstius</hi> ſhould be publikely burnt, as well in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard, as in both the Vniuerſities of this Kingdome, wee thought good to renew our former requeſt vnto the States, for the baniſhment of <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> by a Letter which wee cauſed our Ambaſſadour to deliuer vnto them from vs at their Aſſembly in the <hi>Hage,</hi> the fifth of Nouember; whereunto they had refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs in their former anſwere, the tenor of which Letter was as followeth:</p>

                     <p>Hauing vnderstood by your anſwere to that Propoſition which was made vnto you in our name by our Ambaſſadour there reſident, That at your Aſsembly to bee holden in Nouember next, you are reſolued then to giue order concerning the buſineſse of that wretched<hi> D. Vorſtius, </hi>Wee haue thought good (notwithſtanding the declaration which our Ambaſſadour hath already made vnto you in our name touching that particular,) to put you againe in remembrance thereof by this Letter, and thereby freely to diſcharge our ſelues, both in point of our duetie towards God, and of that ſincere friendſhip which wee beare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you.</p>
                     <p>Firſt We aſſure Our ſelues that you are ſufficiently perſwaded that no worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect could moue Vs to haue thus importuned you in an affaire of this nature, being drawen into it onely through Our zeale to the glory of God, and the care which Wee haue that all occaſion of ſuch great ſcandals as this is, vnto the trew reformed Church
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:23110:199"/>of God, might bee in due time foreſeene and preuented. Wee are therefore to let you vnderſtand, that Wee doe not a little wonder, that you haue not onely ſought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide an habitation in ſo eminent a place amongſt you, for ſuch a corrupted perſon as this<hi> Vorſtius </hi>is, but that you haue alſo afforded him your licenſe and protection to print that Apologie which he hath dedicated vnto you; A booke wherein he doeth moſt impudently maintaine the execrable blasphemies, which in his former hee had diſgorged; The which wee are now able to affirme out of our owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, hauing ſince that Letter which wee wrote vnto our Ambaſsadour, read ouer and ouer againe with our owne eyes (not without extreme miſlike and horrour) both his bookes, the first dedicated to the Lantgraue of<hi> Heſſen, </hi>and the other to you. We had well hoped, that the corrupt ſeed which that enemie of God<hi> Arminius </hi>did ſowe amongſt you ſome few yeeres ſince (whoſe diſciples and followers are yet too bold and frequent within your Dominions) had giuen you a ſufficient warning, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to take heed of ſuch infected perſons, ſeeing your owne Countrey men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diuided into Factions vpon this occaſion, a matter ſo oppoſite to vnitie (which is indeed the onely prop and ſafetie of your State next vnder God) as of neceſsitie it muſt by little and little bring you to vtter ruine, if wiſely you doe not prouide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and that in time.</p>
                     <p>It is trew that it was Our hard hap not to heare of this<hi> Arminius </hi>before he was dead, and that all the Reformed Churches of<hi> Germanie </hi>had with open mouth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of him. But aſsoone as Wee vnderſtood of that diſtraction in your State, which after his death he left behind him, We did not faile (taking the opportunitie when your laſt extraordinary Ambaſſadors were here with Vs) to vſe ſome ſuch ſpeeches vnto them concerning this matter, as We thought fitteſt for the good of your State, and which we doubt not but they haue faithfully reported vnto you; For what need We make any queſtion of the arrogancie of theſe Heretiques, or rather Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Sectaries amongst you, when one of them at this preſent remaining in your towne of<hi> Leyden, </hi>hath not onely preſumed to publiſh of late a blaſphemous Booke of the Apoſtaſie of the Saints, but hath beſides beene ſo impudent, as to ſend the other day a copie thereof, as a goodly preſent, to Our Arch-Biſhop of<hi> Canterbury, </hi>together with a letter, wherein he is not aſhamed (as alſo in his Booke) to lie ſo groſsely, as to auowe, that his Hereſies conteined in the ſaid Booke, are agreeable with the Religion and profeſsion of Our Church of<hi> England. </hi>For theſe reſpects therefore haue Wee cauſe enough very heartily to requeſt you, to roote out with ſpeed thoſe Hereſies and Schiſmes, which are beginning to bud foorth amongst you, which if you ſuffer to haue the reines any longer, you cannot expect any other iſſue thereof, then the curſe of God, infamy throughout all the reformed Churches, and a perpetuall rent and diſtraction in the whole body of your State. But if peraduenture this wretched<hi> Vorſtius </hi>ſhould denie or equiuocate vpon thoſe blaſphemous poynts of Hereſie and Atheiſme, which already hee hath broached, that perhaps may mooue you to ſpare his perſon, and not cauſe him to bee burned (which neuer any Heretique better deſerued, and wherein we will leaue him to your owne (bristian wiſedome) but to ſuffer him vpon any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or abnegation, which hee ſhall offer to make, ſtill to continue and to teach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, is a thing ſo abominable, as we aſſure our ſelues it will not once enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any of your thoughts: For admit hee would proue himſelfe innocent (which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:23110:200"/>he cannot doe) in moſt of thoſe points wherewith hee is charged; yet were it but the ſcandall of his perſon, which will ſtill remaine, it were cauſe more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for you to remooue him out of your Dominions. You know what is written of<hi> Caeſars </hi>wife, that it was not ſufficient for her to be innocent, but ſhe muſt alſo bee free from all occaſion of ſuspicion: how much more then ought you to bee warie and cautious in a matter of ſo great importance as this, which concerneth the glory of God, the ſaluation of your ſoules, the ſoules of your people, and the ſafetie of your State; and not to ſuffer ſo dangerous a ſparke to lie kindling amongst you? For a man may eaſily coniecture, that feare and the horrour of his owne actions will make him boldly denie that poyſon which boyleth at his heart: For what will not bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that denieth the Eternitie and Omnipotencie of God?

But especially ought you to bee very carefull, not to hazard the corruption of your youth in ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous an Vniuerſitie by the doctrine of ſo ſcandalous a perſon, who (it is to bee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) when hee findeth himſelfe once well ſetled there, will returne againe to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient vomite.</p>
                     <p>We will therefore conclude with this request vnto you, that you will aſsure your ſelues, that the affection onely which wee beare vnto your State, hath enforced vs to vſe this libertie towards you, not doubting for our part, but that, as this which wee haue written vnto you proceedes from the ſinceritie of our conſcience, ſo our good God will bee pleaſed to giue you a due apprehenſion thereof, and that your reſolution in a matter of ſo great conſequence, may tend to his glory, to your owne honour and ſafetie, to the extirpation of theſe ſpringing<hi> Atheiſmes </hi>and<hi> Hereſies, </hi>and to the ſatisfaction, not onely of vs, but of all the reformed Churches, who haue bene hitherto extremely ſcandalized therewith: But if on the contrary part, we faile of that wee expect at your hands (which God forbid) and that you ſuffer hereafter ſuch peſtilent<hi> Heretiques </hi>to nestle among you, who dare take vpon them that licentious libertie, to fetch againe from Hell the ancient<hi> Hereſies </hi>long ſince condemned, or elſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent new of their owne braine, contrary to the beliefe of the trew Catholike Church, wee ſhall then bee conſtrained (to our great griefe) publikely to proteſt againſt theſe abominations: and (as God hath honoured vs with the Title of<hi> Defender of the Faith) </hi>not onely to depart and ſeparate our ſelues from the vnion of ſuch falſe and heretical Churches, but alſo to exhort all other reformed Churches to ioyne with vs in a common Councel, how to extinguiſh and remand to hell theſe abominable<hi> Hereſies, </hi>that now newly begin to put foorth againe. And furthermore for our owne particular, we ſhall be enforced ſtrictly to inhibite the youth of our Dominions from repairing to ſo infected a place, as is the Vniuerſitie of<hi> Leyden. Sed meliora ſperamus &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minamur, </hi>We hope and expect for better, aſſuring our ſelues in the mercie of our good God, that as he hath a long time preſerued you from your temporall enemies, and at this time is beginning to eſtabliſh your Eſtate to the contentment of all your friends, (but especially to ours, who haue neuer beene wanting to aſsiſt you vpon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that the ſame God will not leaue you for a prey to your ſpirituall aduerſaries,

In which respect, his Maiestie hauing vnderſtood, that my Lords the States of</hi> Holland <hi>were determined to call vnto the place of Diuinitie Profeſſour in the Vniuer ſitie of</hi> Leyden, <hi>one</hi> Doctor Conradus Vorſtius, <hi>a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon attainted by many witneſſes,</hi> iuris &amp; facti, <hi>of a number of Hereſies (the ſhame whereof would light vpon the Church of God, and conſequently vpon his Maiesties perſon and Crownes) is therewith exceedingly offended: And for the more timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of an infinitie of euils, which neceſſarily would thereupon enſue, did giue mee in charge by expreſse Letters to exhort you (which I did the</hi> 21. <hi>of September laſt) to waſh your hands from that man, and not to fuffer him to come within your Countrey. To this exhortation, your anſwere was, that in the carriage of this buſineſſe, all due obſeruance and regard ſhould be had vnto his Maieſtie. Neuertheleſſe ſo it is, that his Maieſtie hath receiued ſo little respect heerein, as that in ſtead of debarring</hi> Vorſtius <hi>from comming into the Countrey (which euen by the lawes of friendſhip his Maiestie might haue required) the proceedings haue beene cleane contrary; for he is ſuffered to come vnto</hi> Leyden, <hi>hath beene receiued there with all honour, hath there taken vp his habitation, where he is treated and lodged in the qualitie of a publique Profeſſour. His Maiestie then perceiuing, that his firſt motion had ſo little preuailed, thought good to write himſelfe a Letter vnto you, to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, full of zeale and affection, perſwading you by many reaſons there ſet downe at length, not to ſtaine your owne honour, and the honour of the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, by calling vnto you that wretched and wicked Atheist.

Some ſixe weekes after, I receiued an Anſwere to my Propoſition but an Anſwere confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ambiguous and wholly impertinent, by which I haue reaſon to conceiue, that there is no meaning at all to ſend</hi> Vorſtius <hi>away, who is at this preſent in</hi> Leyden, <hi>receiued and acknowledged, respected and treated as publique Profeſſour, whether it be to grace that Vniuerſitie in ſtead of the deceaſed</hi> Ioſeph Scaliger, <hi>I cannot tell, or whether it bee to giue him meanes to doe more miſchiefe in ſecret, which perhaps for ſhame hee durſt not in publique: For theſe reaſons, according vnto that charge, which I haue receiued from the King my Maſter, I doe in his name, and on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe Proteſt in this Aſſembly, againſt the wrong, iniurie, and ſcandall done vnto the reformed Religion by the receiuing and reteining of</hi> Conradus Vorſtius <hi>in the Vniuerſitie of</hi> Leyden, <hi>and againſt the violence offered vnto that Alliance which is betwixt his Maieſtie and your Prouinces; the which beeing founded vpon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation and maintenance of the reformed Religion, you haue not letted (ſo much as in you lies) abſolutely to violate in the proceeding of this cauſe.

               <p>And certainely wee are no leſſe ſorie, then amazed, that the <hi>Curators</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> (as appeareth by a long letter which they haue written to the States Ambaſſador reſident with vs) can haue their vnderſtanding ſo ſtupified, as to haue made choice of the perſon of <hi>Vorstius</hi> for a man well qualified, to appeaſe the Schiſmes and troubles of their Church and Vniuerſitie, and as an apt inſtrument of peace.

                  <p>As concerning the Glory of God; If the ſubiect of <hi>Vorſtius</hi> his Hereſies had not bene grounded vpon Queſtions of a higher qualitie then touching the number and nature of the Sacraments, the points of Iuſtification, of Merits, of Purgatorie, of the viſible head of the Church, or any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as are in controuerſie at this day betwixt the Papiſts and vs; Nay more, If hee had medled onely with the nature and workes of GOD <hi>ad extra,</hi> (as the Schoolemen ſpeake,) If (wee ſay) hee had ſoared no higher pitch (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee ſhould haue bene very ſory to ſee ſuch Hereſies begin to take roote amongſt our Allies and ancient confederates;) Neuertheleſſe, wee doe freely profeſſe, that in that caſe wee ſhould neuer haue troubled our ſelues with the buſineſſe in ſuch faſhion, and with that feruencie as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we haue done.

To which reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we were the rather induced by the example of diuers other Prouinces vnder the dominion of the ſaid States, who did accuſe <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded <hi>Holland</hi> to ſend him away out of their countrey, as before we haue declared.</p>
                  <p>It is trew, that if <hi>Vorstius</hi> had beene a natiue of <hi>Holland,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> was, it had beene ſufficient for vs to haue giuen them a generall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the danger, and then to haue referred it vnto themſelues, to take ſuch courſe therein, as to them ſhould ſeeme conuenient: But this <hi>Vorſtius</hi> being a ſtranger, and ſent for out of another Countrey to inſtruct their youth, hee can challenge no ſuch priuiledge by reaſon of his birth, but that the States may lawfully diſcharge him, whenſoeuer they pleaſe. And for his profeſſion, it is (without doubt) leſſe dangerous, to ſuffer a thouſand Lay Heretiques to liue in a Common wealth (for that is but matter of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, ſo long as they offend not in their ſpeach, and ſeduce not others,) then to haue ſo much as one Doctour that may poiſon the youth: For, <hi>Quo ſemel est imbuta recens ſeruabit odorem Teſta diu;</hi> The veſſell will taſtea long time after of that liquor wherewith it is firſt ſeaſoned; And what ſhall become of the litle brookes, if their Fountaine be corrupted?</p>
                  <p>And from hence is deriued our third reaſon which perſwaded vs to meddle in this buſineſſe. For if generally the youth of thoſe Countreys our neereſt neighbours ſhould happen to be infected, in what danger then were wee? eſpecially ſeeing ſo many of the yonger ſort of our Subiects doe repaire for learning ſake to the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Leyden:</hi> an Vniuerſitie of long time famous, but ſo much the more renowned, for that, within our remembrance, it hath beene adorned with thoſe two excellent perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Iunius.</hi> It is furthermore to bee noted, that the ſpirituall infection of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> is ſo much more dangerous, then the bodily infection of the plague, by how much the ſoule is more noble then the body, which cauſed the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> when, entring into a Bath, he met there by chance <hi>Cerinthus</hi> the Heretique, to turne backe againe vpon the ſuddaine for feare of infection.

                  <p>To the firſt Obiection wee anſwere, that we neuer accuſed him by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, but that we find his owne words and ſentences full of <hi>Hereſies.</hi>

                  <p>To the ſecond, concerning his queſtions or diſquiſitions (as he termeth them) wee ſay, that in doubtfull matters, and where a man may reſolue either one way or other, without danger of making ſhipwracke of Faith, it is not onely tolerable, but very commendable to propound queſtions or arguments, at leaſtwiſe in Schooles: But to deuiſe new queſtions vpon the principall Articles of our Faith, to enter not onely into the ſecret Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of GOD, but to intrude our ſelues into his Eſſence, to prie into his moſt inward parts, and like the Phyſicians of <hi>Pantagruel,</hi> to viſite with torch-light all the moſt hidden places in the Eſſence of GOD, wee may boldy pronounce, <hi>Omnia haec ad destructionem, planè nihil ad aedificationem;</hi> All theſe things tend to deſtruction, and nothing ſurely to edification. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh againſt the curioſitie of thoſe people, who would needs know what GOD did before hee made the Fabrique of the world. The Iewes during their integritie, did beare another maner of reuerence to the Diuinitie, who thought themſelues dead, if once they ſhould ſee GOD. And their great Law-giuer <hi>Moyſes</hi> could obtaine no more (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his humble and inſtant requeſt) then to ſee the hinder parts of GOD. So as to call into queſtion, or to make doubts of theſe high points of the Eſſence of GOD, of the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> of the <hi>bypostaticall</hi> Vnion in the perſon of CHRIST, or to ſpeake of them in other termes then the Church of GOD hath vniformely eſtabliſhed, and in all aages ſucceſſiuely approued, as it is conteined in all the Orthodox Creeds, and declared in the foure firſt Councels, is by no meanes lawfull: And to make any queſtion or diſquiſition vpon theſe high myſteries, is as much in effect, as to make a contrary concluſion; and ſuch a diſquiſition deſerues the puniſhment of the Inquiſion. <hi>Non eſt bonum ludere cum Sanctis, multò minùs ergo cum Deo;</hi> 
                     <q>It is not good to ieſt with Saints, much leſſe therefore with GOD: and one of the firſt verſes which our little children are taught, is this: <hi>Mitte arcana Dei, coelùmque inquirere quid ſit;</hi> Let the ſecrets of God alone, and be not too curious to enquire into heauen.</q> For what difference is there I pray you, to ſay, It may be that ſuch a Lady is a whore; or that there be probable arguments to perſwade vs that ſhe is ſuch a one; or to ſay abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely that ſhee is a whore? And (wee imagine) <hi>Vorstius</hi> would not hold
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:23110:206"/>him for his friend, that ſhould ſay it were a matter very diſputable whether <hi>Vorstius</hi> were a damnable Heretique, and ſhould goe quicke to Hell, yea or no: not that he did beleeue him to bee ſuch a one, but that there were many arguments probable enough to perſwade a man to take him for no leſſe. The nature of man, through the tranſgreſſion of our firſt parents hath loſt free-will, and reteineth not now any ſhadow thereof, ſauing an inclination to euill, thoſe onely excepted whom God of his meere grace hath ſanctified and purged from this originall Leproſie; Inſomuch as it is a very perillous thing to ſet abroach theſe new and dangerous queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, although they bee accompanied with good anſweres: For the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the world, following the footſteps of our firſt Parents, are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally enclined to chooſe the euill, and to leaue that which is good, and therefore the Diuine Poet <hi>Du Bartas,</hi> ſpeaking of the deſtruction of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and loath to name the ſinne for which it was deſtroyed, ſaith thus;

                  </p>
                  <p>As concerning the fourth and laſt excuſe; namely, that <hi>Vorſtius</hi> hath in his laſt Bookes ſufficiently purged himſelfe from theſe calumnies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all Hereſies: Our anſwere is, That we would very heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt the States in their next Aſſembly, ſeriouſly and aduiſedly to conſider and obſerue the ſtyle which he vſeth in his writings and excuſes, and then
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:23110:206"/>ſhall they be able to iudge what kind of ſpirit it is that guideth his penne.</p>
                  <p>For, to beginne with the Preface of his Booke, intituled his <hi>Chriſtian and modeſt Anſwere,</hi> he makes there ſo light reckoning of his queſtions before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, as if it were but about the tale of <hi>Tobies</hi> dogge. For in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond page of his ſaid Preface, theſe be his wordes: <hi>Omnis homo eſt mendax, immò vanitate ipſâ vanior, ſolus verò Deus eſt verax, &amp;c. Quod cùm in omnibus magni momenti negotijs, tum maximè in ſanctiſsimâ fidei cauſâ humiliter nobis ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per agnoſcendum eſt: ne videlicet quidquam quod primâ fronte nobis nouum, immò falſum, &amp; abſurdum videatur, facilè damnemus, nec contra quicquid vulgò recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt, (in rebus praeſertim abſtruſis ac perplexis, nec tamen ad ſalutem ſcitu neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rijs) &amp; quidem cum opinione praeciſae neceſsitatis, ſtatim approbemus. In his talibus, ſi quis Regem, aut Principem, alioqui pientiſsimum, immò Reges, &amp; Principes eiuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi complures, (addo &amp; Epiſcopos, ſeu Doctores Eccleſiae, non diſsimiles) aliquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulum errare dixerit, nihil opinor aduerſus Regiam Maieſtatem, nihil aduerſus Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipum, aut Epiſcoporum dignitatem reuerâ peccauerit, modò ſemper rationes ſuorum</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>dictorum modeſtè reddere paratus ſit.</hi> That is to ſay, Euery man is a lyer, yea, more vaine then vanity it ſelfe, God onely is trew, &amp;c. Which ſeeing wee ought euer humbly to acknowledge in all great and weighty cauſes, moſt of all ought we to confeſſe it in the moſt holy cauſe of our Faith: inſomuch as we ſhould not therefore eaſily condemne euery thing which at the firſt ſeemes ſtrange, yea falſe and abſurd vnto our eares, nor on the contrary ſide, ought wee foorth-with to approoue, and that with an opinion of preciſe neceſſitie, whatſoeuer is commonly receyued, eſpecially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters abſtruſe and intricate, whereof the knowledge is not neceſſarie to ſaluation. In ſuch poynts as theſe, if any man ſhall ſay, that ſuch a King, or Prince, howſoeuer otherwiſe moſt godly and religious, yea that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Kings, and Princes (nay, I will not except Biſhops, or the like Doctors of the Church) haue in ſome ſort erred, I am of opinion, hee ſhall not giue any iuſt cauſe of offence, either to the Maieſtie of Kings, or to the dignitie of Princes and Biſhops, ſo as hee bee alwaies ready modeſtly to yeeld a reaſon for that which hee ſhall affirme.</q> In which words, hee maintaineth two Principles: Firſt, that euery man is a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, aſwell in matter of Faith, as in any thing elſe; and next, that wee muſt not euer eſteeme the vulgar opinion, and that which is generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in matter of Faith to be the treweſt, nor alwayes condemne euery opinion for abſurd, which at the firſt ſeemes vnto vs vncouth, and new. Now we pray you obſerue, that this man is not accuſed of ſmall ſcapes, and therefore beeing not charged with leſſer <hi>peccadillos,</hi> then thoſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee haue mentioned, it neceſſarily followes, that in his excuſe hee muſt vnderſtand the ſame points whereof he is accuſed. And wee hope by the mercy of GOD, that no Chriſtian (wee ſpeake in this particular, as well for the Papiſts, as for our ſelues) ſhall euer be found to erre in any of thoſe maine points: at the leaſt wee will anſwere, (by the grace of God,) for one of thoſe Kings whom he names in general. And as for his new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:23110:207"/>which he would ſo gladly vent abroad, the ancient Faith needes not be changed like an old garment, either in ſubſtance, or faſhion.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, in the third page of his Preface, hee vſeth theſe words, <hi>Sed neque plures vno aliquo ſemper hîc ditiores ſunt. Nemo igitur vnus ſibi arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>omnia. Nec numero plures vni alicui, ſingulare quidquam inuideant.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are many men alwayes richer <hi>[in knowledge]</hi> then ſome one man. Let not therefore any one man arrogate all things to himſelfe. Nor let the greater multitude enuie a particular man,</q> for hauing ſome ſingularitie more then his fellowes. The trew principle and foundation of the error of the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> taking away by this meanes, all maner of gouernment from the Church: For hauing firſt ouerthrowen the Monarchicall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Pope, he ſweepes away next all manner of power both Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall and Democraticall from the Church, cleane contrary to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles inſtitution, which ordeineth, that <hi>the ſpirits of the Prophets ſhould bee ſubiect to the Prophets.</hi> For if one particular man may take vpon him ſuch a ſingularitie as this, how ſhall he bee ſubiect to Generall, Nationall, and Synodicall Councels? For ſtraight will he ſay vnto them; Sirs, yee haue no authoritie to iudge mee, for I haue a ſingular gift aboue you all. And in the fift Page, theſe are his words: <hi>Plamſsimè enim perſuaſus ſum, Sereniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo Regi nunquam in animo fuiſſe, nunquam in animo fore, alienae conſcientiae (quod ne Apostoli quidem ſibi vnquam arrogârunt) fiue directè, fiue indirectè, ſiue per ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſum, ſiue per alios vllatenùs dominari, vel fidem nostram vlli humanae authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>alligare velle.</hi> For I am abſolutely perſwaded, that it was neuer his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties meaning, nor euer will bee, either directly, or indirectly, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or by others, in any ſort to ouer-rule another mans conſcience, (which euen the Apoſtles neuer challenged to themſelues) nor did, or will his Maieſtie euer ſeeke to tie our Faith to any humane authoritie.</q> Whereby hee is plainely diſcouered, to bee reſolued not to bee ſubiect in any ſort to the iudgement of the Church, in thoſe matters whereof hee is accuſed. For hee knowes too well, that the ancient Church hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed vpon neceſſary conſequences drawen from the holy Scripture, both a forme of beliefe, and a forme of ſpeach concerning the holy Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries aforeſaid: And this is the reaſon why hee will not in theſe points ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe to the iudgement of any mortall man; But vpon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the ſeuenth page of his Preface, maintaines his Chriſtian libertie in this maner: <hi>Qui quidem humanas deciſiones à Diuinis myſterijs ſcrupuloſé ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregem; &amp; praeſertim in audaces Scholarum hypotheſes, pro Christiana libertate</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>interdum diligentiùs inquiram;</hi> I, who curiouſly make a ſeparation betwixt the iudgements of men and the Diuine myſteries, and eſpecially accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Chriſtian libertie, doe ſometimes more narrowly looke into the bold ſupoſitions of the Schoolemen.</q> As if the Schoole Diuines had bene too ventrous, to explaine and to defend the Articles aforeſaid, already ſo eſtabliſhed by the Church: But we may trewly wiſh in that point, as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> did touching <hi>Caluin: Vtinam ſemper ſic erraſſent Scholastici;</hi> Would
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:23110:207"/>God the Scholemen had alwayes ſo erred: For in the maine grounds of Chriſtian Religion, they are worthy of all commendation. Reade <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> againſt the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But in matters of controuerſie, where they were to flatter the Pope in his reſolutions, and to auow the new ordinances and traditions of their Church, there they yeelded (alas) vnto the iniquitie of the time, and the myſterie of iniquitie, which was euen then in working, got likewiſe the vpper hand ouer them. And as for this Chriſtian libertie, which he doeth vrge ſo much, certainely he doeth it with no other inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but onely vnder this faire pretext, to haue the better meanes, and with more ſafetie to abuſe the world: For Chriſtian libertie is neuer meant in the holy Scripture, but onely in matters indifferent, or when it is taken for our deliuerance from the thraldome of the Law, or from the burden of humane traditions, and in that ſenſe <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſpeaketh in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſsians, Quare oneraminiritibus?</hi> Why are ye burdened with traditions? But to abuſe Chriſtian libertie, in preſuming to propound a new doctrine vnto the world, in point of the higheſt and holieſt myſteries of GOD, is a moſt audacious raſhneſſe, and an impudent arrogancie: Concerning which <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Though an Angel from heauen, preach vnto you otherwiſe then that which we haue preached vnto you, let him bee accurſed.</hi> And <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> likewiſe commandeth vs, that wee ſhould not ſo much as ſay, <hi>God ſpeed</hi> to that man, which ſhall bring vs any other doctrine, as wee haue obſerued before.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſhew that he is a forger of new opinions, by which he would faine make himſelfe ſingular, ſee but his wordes immediately preceding thoſe which a little before wee mentioned, where hee boaſteth, and is wonderfully in loue with a new name which he hath taken vpon himſelfe, that is to ſay, <hi>Purus putus Euangelicus,</hi> A mainly pure Goſpeller; although indeed the word <hi>pure</hi> was neuer yet taken in a good part. For amongſt the ancient <hi>Heretiques,</hi> there was a Sect that called themſelues <hi>Catharoi,</hi> and there was alſo another Sect among the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> that were called <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes,</hi> from whence the <hi>Preciſians</hi> of our Kingdomes, who out of ſelfe-will and fancie refuſe to conforme themſelues to the Orders of our Church, haue borrowed their name. And for the word <hi>Goſpeller,</hi> although it hath bene aſſumed in diuers places by ſome of our Religion, yet hath it this ill fortune, that it is more vſually receiued in thoſe parts of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heme,</hi> where there are ſuch infinite diuerſities of Sects (agreeing in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but in their Vnion againſt the <hi>Pope</hi>) then in any other place. The holy Scripture it ſelfe in the <hi>Actes of the Apoſtles,</hi> mentioneth the name of <hi>Christians:</hi> and the ancient <hi>Primitiue</hi> Church did attribute vnto the faithfull, the names of <hi>Catholique</hi> and <hi>Orthodox.</hi> So as for ſuch a fellow as <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> to affect new Titles for his Religion, it hath ſurely no good reliſh: his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without doubt being no other, then by this meanes to make a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and in time a rupture betwixt himſelfe, and the <hi>Orthodox</hi> profeſſors of our Religion. And for proofe that hee is ſtedfaſtly reſolued to perſiſt
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:23110:208"/>in all theſe nouelties, and not to retract any thing of that which he hath written, ſee what hee ſaith in the laſt page ſaue one of his ſaid Preface. <hi>Opinor enim ipſe (vt magni illius Eraſmi verba hìc aemuler) in libris meis nihil repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riri, quo deterior quiſpiam reddi poſsit.</hi> For I am of opinion (to vſe the words of that great <hi>Eraſmus</hi>) that there is nothing to be found in my Bookes, that can make any man the worſe that reads them.</p>
                  <p>As for his Booke which followes this Preface, it verifies the Prouerbe, <hi>Dignum patellà operculum,</hi> A couer fit for ſuch a diſh. For it is ſo full of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and ſophiſticall euaſions, ſo ſtuft with <hi>As it weres, in ſome ſorts, in my ſence,</hi> and ſuch words as theſe, as euen in that poynt hee hath alſo a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> But God is <hi>Vnity</hi> it ſelfe, and <hi>Veritie</hi> is <hi>One,</hi> and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and in our vſuall manner of ſpeech, we call it <hi>the ſimple Verity,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was it yet called, <hi>the double veritie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee haue thought good to ſet downe here two places of his ſayd Booke, that thereby the Reader may iudge of the reſt; whereof one is in the twelfth page, in theſe words, <hi>Argumenta quae adferuntur à Patribus, vel à re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centioribus Theologis pro aeterna Christi generatione, aut fallacia ſunt, aut friuola.</hi> The arguments which are vſed both by the Fathers and by the moderne Diuines, for the eternall generation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are either ſophiſticall or fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous. Theſe words (as he ſaith) he is charged to haue vſed, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bethinke him of any other euaſion, but to adde the word <hi>Quaedam,</hi> ſome arguments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now wee ſhall deſire thee (good Reader) here to obſerue, that this man condemning ſome arguments which the Fathers had gathered out of the holy Scripture, to prooue the eternall generation of Chriſt, as deceitfull and friuolous, hee will bee ſure howſoeuer not to alleadge any other arguments, either out of the Fathers, or of his owne brayne, which ſhall be ſtronger then thoſe which he hath reiected. And in the ſame faſhion he behaues himſelfe throughout his whole Booke: for we ſhew you this but for a ſcantling. In the other place, he directly denies, that euer he affirmed in his other Booke, that <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Desperation</hi> were incident to God: his wordes are theſe in the eighth page, <hi>Nam metum &amp; desperationem ne quidem vspiàm nominaui.</hi> For I did neuer ſo much as name <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Deſperation,</hi> in any place. And yet neuertheleſſe, let any man looke vpon his other Booke,
<note place="margin">Tract. Theol. de Deo.</note> 
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 114. and <hi>pag.</hi> 450. and hee ſhall find two ſeuerall Diſcourſes of a good length, concerning theſe two points. Herein hauing no other ſhift, he betakes himſelfe to an abſolute and flat Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. But to the intent, that the Reader may iudge of his maner of ſpeaking through his whole laſt Booke intituled, <hi>A Chriſtian and modeſt Anſwere,</hi> and how he playes the Sophiſter therein; we haue ſet downe diuers of his phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes (in manner of a Table) which we haue cauſed to be extracted out of his ſaid Booke.</p>

                  <p>By this may the Reader manifeſtly diſcerne, that there is nothing which a man, ſpeaking in this faſhion ſhall not be able to maintaine, and by this meanes eaſily prooue <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet.</hi> And certainely his manner of excuſes and euaſions are framed iuſt after the mould of the ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, and namely of <hi>Arrius,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> when they ſaw themſelues pinched with the Arguments of the <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> Church, and had no power to reſiſt. The ſame alſo doeth more plainely appeare by an other little booke which he hath publiſhed, intituled, <hi>Theologicall poſitions,</hi> which booke he hath made of purpoſe to blinde the world withall; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are indeed but the ſame <hi>Theſes</hi> or <hi>Poſitions,</hi> vpon which he hath diſputed in his firſt wicked booke, that beareth the title <hi>Of God and his Attributes.</hi> For in the <hi>Theſes</hi> themſelues there is but little harme, but in his diſputations thereupon are couched all the horrible Hereſies: And therefore in this booke hath hee publiſhed onely his <hi>Theſes</hi> which are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable; and left out his diſputations vpon the <hi>Theſes,</hi> wherein all the poiſon is conteined. It is moreouer ſomewhat ſuſpicious in ſuch a tainted perſon as he is, that in an Appendix which hee hath placed at the end of his <hi>Theſes,</hi> he taketh occaſion to name a number of Heretiques who are aduerſaries to the doctrine of his <hi>Theſes,</hi> and thoſe eſpecially who haue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red concerning the Diuinitie, Humanitie, Perſon, or Office of CHRIST, as the <hi>Ebionites, Cerinthians, Arrians, Praxians, Sabellians, Marcionites, Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees, Docites, Apollinariſts, Mennonites, Swenkfeldians, Neſtorians, Monothelites, Eutychians, Monophyſites, Iewes, Millenaries, Papiſts.</hi> Amongſt which rabble he doeth not once make mention of <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> nor of <hi>Photinius,</hi> who ſucceeded him as well in his Biſhopricke as in his errour: Yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe it is reported, that <hi>Vorſtius</hi> in his heart is not very farre from their erronious opinion.</p>
                  <p>Now in the Preface of this little booke hee hath taken vpon him very ſuccinctly to make anſwere to fiue Articles which he confeſſeth were layd to his charge, by which anſwere, in our opinion, hee diſcouers himſelfe very plainely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="377" facs="tcp:23110:210"/>The firſt point is, That hee was once accuſed (as himſelfe ſaith) of the <hi>Samoſatenian</hi> Hereſie, becauſe he had ſometime both written and receiued letters from diuers of that Sect; which he confeſſeth he did indeed in his youth, to this end, that by that meanes hee might the more eaſily come by ſome of their bookes, but that afterward hee did forbeare all correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie with them. Firſt of all then, we would be glad to know why hee forgot the Hereſie of <hi>Samoſatenus</hi> in his <hi>Appendix,</hi> where he names ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, and yet confeſſeth in the Preface of his ſaid booke, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was accuſed of that errour. Secondly, to what end had hee in his youth ſo great traffique with theſe Heretiques? was it to enable him the better to confute them? We heare him not ſay ſo much, as indeed it was neuer his end. Surely this fellow would be an excellent cleanſer of a Peſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, for he feares no infection: <hi>Picem contrectare non timet,</hi> he dares han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle any pitch: And yet for all that, the Prouerbe is trew, <hi>Qui ambulat in Sole, colorabitur;</hi> He that walketh in the Sun-ſhine, ſhall bee Sun-burnt. It followes then, ſeeing his intention was not to arme himſelfe againſt them, that it muſt be of neceſſitie to make himſelfe worthy of their Schoole, the which hee almoſt confeſſeth in the laſt words of his Anſwere to that point, where he ſaith thus; <hi>Non enim (quod multi ſolent) alienis ſenſibus hîc fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum putaui, aut temerè quidquam in cauſa Fidei damnandum:</hi> For I doe not thinke it fit (as many others doe) to relie in theſe caſes vpon other mens conſtructions, or raſhly to condemne any thing which concernes matter of Faith.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond Article of his Accuſation, hee confeſſeth that hee gaue ſome of his <hi>Samoſatenian</hi> bookes vnto his ſchollers; Surely, a goodly gift: But the caution was prettie which he gaue withall vnto them when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered them the bookes; which was that they ought to reade them with iudgement, not raſhly reiecting the doctrine commonly receiued. What an Epithite is heere for our holy <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> Faith, to terme it no otherwiſe then the doctrine commonly receiued? And as for his caution, not raſhly to forſake the old doctrine, it is no more then the Turkes would giue vnto any Chriſtian, that ſhould ſuddenly offer to become a Mahometiſt. Nay what Chriſtian did euer ſollicite a Pagan, or Heretique to bee conuerted, but with this caution? Who Would perſwade a man to receiue the holy Sacrament raſhly? S. <hi>Paul</hi> commands euery man to examine himſelfe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, before hee come to that holy Table. But on the other ſide, an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe</hi> 
                     <q>Chriſtian would in this caſe haue ſaid to his ſchollers: If you will reade theſe wicked bookes, reade them with horrour and deteſtation, and with an intent to arme your ſelues againſt ſuch wiles and ſubtilties of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, and withall pray vnto GOD to keepe you conſtant in the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique and <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> Faith, that theſe Hereſies may haue no power once to mooue you, truſting in his mercy, and not in your owne ſtrength.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the third Article, he confeſſeth that his ſchollers did publiſh bookes of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Hereſie; and his excuſe is, that it was without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:23110:211"/>But howſoeuer, he condemnes them not for hauing done it onely this he ſaith, That they declared vpon their oathes, they did not fauour the Hereſie.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth point, he confeſſeth that about ten yeeres ſince, he wrote a booke <hi>De Filiatione Chriſti,</hi> (for which Title onely, an Authour, ſo ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as he, is worthy of the fagot,) and all his excuſe is, That he wrote an Epitome vpon <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Wee doubt not but hee did it for his recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Forſooth, a prety conceit. Yet it appeares not by his wordes, that he deteſts the ſubiect of that Booke: but ſaith, That no man can thereby coniecture what his opinion is of that argument, no more then they can vpon his Epitome of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which was likewiſe his worke. For to condemne it, had beene contrary to that which hee auowed in his other booke, neuer to repent himſelfe of any thing that he hath once written, as already we haue obſerued.</p>
                  <p>As for the fift and laſt point, he will neither confeſſe, nor deny the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: onely hee ſaith, That a certaine booke intituled <hi>Dominicus Lopez,</hi> which is (as we haue heard) a very blaſphemous Treatiſe, was ſuppreſſed by him <hi>pacis ergò,</hi> for peace ſake; but he is ſo farre from condemning it, as that he alleadgeth, the booke hath bene maintained by others, which in time ſhall appeare. Two things are here to bee obſerued; Firſt, that hee ſuppreſſed it <hi>pacis ergò,</hi> for quietneſſe ſake; Not therefore for the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſubiect, The next, that in his due time: the trewth thereof ſhall appeare. In which laſt point onely, we will willingly ioyne with him, beſeeching our good GOD, for his CHRISTS ſake, that hee will bee pleaſed to diſcouer the trewth of this mans intentions, as well for his owne Glory, as to purge the ſcandall, and to auoyd the danger which may enſue vnto Chriſtendome, by the darnell of Hereſies which he hath ſowne.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore to bee noted, That to all theſe fiue Articles his anſweres are ſo ſilly and weake, as in three of them we haue found him <hi>planè confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentem reum,</hi> plainely pleading guiltie; blanching it onely with ſome poore excuſes. And to the other two points his anſwers are doubtfull; yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condemning the act of his ſchollers, nor the laſt wicked booke called <hi>Dominicus Lopez.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hauing now therefore briefly laied open the ſubtilties, friuolous diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and excuſes of the ſaid <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> we will conclude this point with this proteſtation; That if he had bene our owne Subiect, we would haue bid him <hi>Excrea,</hi> ſpit out: and forced him to haue produced, and confeſſed thoſe wicked Hereſies, that are rooted in his heart. And in caſe he ſhould ſtand vpon his Negatiue, we would enioyne him to ſay (according to the ancient cuſtome of the Primitiue Church in the like caſes of Heretiques) <hi>I renounce and from my ſoule detest them: Anathema, Maranatha</hi> vpon ſuch and ſuch Hereſies; And not to ſay <hi>For peace ſake I cauſed this booke to be ſuppreſſed, And theſe bookes are to bee read with great iudgement and diſcretion. S. Hierome</hi> liketh not that any man ſhould take it patiently, to be ſuſpected of Hereſie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="379" facs="tcp:23110:211"/>And now to make an end of this Diſcourſe, we doe very heartily deſire all good Chriſtians in generall, and My Lords the States in particular (to whom the managing of this affaire doeth moſt ſpecially belong) to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but two things: Firſt what kinde of people they be that ſlander vs, and our ſincere intention in this cauſe: And next, what priuate intereſt wee can poſſibly haue (in reſpect of any worldly honour or aduancement) here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to engage our ſelues in ſuch ſort as we haue done.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the firſt point, There are but three ſorts of people, that ſeeke to calumniate vs vpon this occaſion: That is to ſay; either ſuch as are infected with the ſame, or the like Hereſies, wherewith <hi>Vorſtius</hi> is tainted, <hi>&amp; ideo fouent conſimilem cauſam,</hi> and therefore doe maintaine the like cauſe: or elſe ſuch as be of the Romane Religion, who in this confuſion, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of propheſying would thruſt in for a part; conceiuing it more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that their doctrine ſhould be tolerated by thoſe of our Religion, then the doctrine of <hi>Vorſtius:</hi> or elſe ſuch, as for reaſon of State enuie peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the good amitie and correſpondencie which is betwixt vs, and the Vnited Prouinces.</p>
                  <p>Touching our owne intereſt, the whole courſe of our life doeth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently witneſſe, that we haue alwayes bene contented with that portion which GOD hath put into our hands, without ſeeking to inuade the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of any other. Beſides, in two of our bookes, as well in our <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as in the Preface to our <hi>Apologie,</hi> we haue ſhewed the ſame inclination. For in the firſt booke, ſpeaking of warre, we ſay that a King ought not to make any inuaſion vpon anothers Dominions, vntill Iuſtice be firſt denied him. And in the other booke, hauing ſhewed the vſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pope, aboue all the Kings and Princes of Chriſtendome, our concluſion is, that we will neuer goe about to perſwade them to aſſault him within his Dominions, but onely to reſume, and preſerue their owne iuſt Priuiledges from his violent intruſion. So as (thankes be to GOD) both our <hi>Theorique</hi> and <hi>Practique</hi> agree well together, to cleare vs from this vniuſt and ſlanderous imputation. And as for the States in particular, it is very vnlikely that we (who haue all our life time held ſo ſtrict an amitie with them, as for their defence wee haue bene contented to expoſe the liues of many of our Subiects of both Nations,) would now practiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt then State, and that vpon ſo poore a ſubiect as <hi>Vorstius:</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that ſo damnable a thing could euer enter into our heart, as vnder the vaile and pretext of the glory of GOD, to plot the aduancement of our owne priuate deſeignes.</p>
                  <p>The reaſons which induced vs to meddle in this buſineſſe, we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared. We leaue it now to his owne proper Iudges to conſider what a nurſling they foſter in their boſome: A ſtranger, bred in the <hi>Socinian Hereſie</hi> (as it is ſaid;) often times accuſed of <hi>Hereſie</hi> by the Churches of <hi>Germanie;</hi> one that hath written ſo wicked and ſcandalous bookes; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and ſeriouſly proteſting in the preface of his <hi>Apologie</hi> to the States,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:23110:212"/>for the libertie of prophecying; and twice or thrice inſiſting vpon that libertie in the Preface of his <hi>Modest Anſwere</hi> (a dangerous and pernitious libertie, or rather licentiouſneſſe, opening a gap to all rupture, Schiſme, and confuſion in the Church;) yea hauing had ſome diſciples that be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques themſelues, and others that accuſe him of Hereſie. And though there were no other cauſe then the ſilly and idle ſhifts wherewith hee ſeekes to defend himſelfe in his laſt bookes, it were enough to conuince him, either to haue maintained a bad cauſe, and in that reſpect worthy of a farre greater puniſhment then to be put by his place of <hi>Profeſsour;</hi> or at the leaſt to be a perſon vnworthy of the name of a <hi>Profeſſour</hi> in ſo famous an Vniuerſitie, for hauing ſo weakely maintained a cauſe that is iuſt. For our part, GOD is our witneſſe, we haue no quarrell againſt his perſon; he is a Stranger, borne farre from our dominions: he is a <hi>Germane,</hi> and it is well knowen, that all <hi>Germanie</hi> are our friends, and the moſt part of the great Princes there, be either neerely allied vnto vs, or our Confederates: he doth outwardly profeſſe the ſame Religion which we do: he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> and hath not mentioned vs, either in ſpeach or writing (for any thing we know) but with all the honour and reſpect that may be. GOD knowes, the worſt that we do wiſh him is, that he may ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely returne into the high beaten path-way of the <hi>Catholique</hi> and <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall</hi> Faith.</p>
                  <p>And for my Lords the States (ſeeing wee haue diſcharged our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) we will now referre the managing of the whole Action vnto their owne diſcretions. For wee are ſo farre from preſcribing them any rule herein, as we ſhall be very well contented (ſo as the buſineſſe be well done) that there be euen no mention at all made of our interceſſion, in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Acts or Records. Their maner of proceeding, we leaue abſolutely to their owne Wiſedomes. <hi>Modò praedicetur Christus,</hi> ſo as CHRIST bee preached, let them vſe their owne formes in the Name of GOD. For we deſire that GOD ſhould ſo iudge vs at the laſt Day, as we affect not in this Action any worldly glory, beſeeching the Creatour ſo to open their eyes, to illuminate their vnderſtandings, direct their reſolutions, and, aboue all, to kindle their zeale, ſanctifie their affections, &amp; at the laſt ſo to bleſſe their Actions and their proceedings in this cauſe, as the iſſue thereof may tend to his Glory, to the comfort and ſolace of the Faithfull, to the honour of our Religion, to the confuſion and extirpation (at the leaſt, profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation) of Hereſies, and, in particular, to the corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boration of the Vnion of the ſayd Prouinces.</p>

Howbeit, my late entire affection to <hi>K.

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:23110:213"/>owne dangers, incurred by the practiſe of conſpiracies flowing from the ſame ſource, hath wrought mee to ſympathize with my friends in their grieuous occurrents: no doubt ſo much more dangerous, as they are leſſe apprehended and felt of Kings themſelues, euen when the danger hangeth ouer their owne heads. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whom, in caſe the power and vertue of my aduertiſements be not able ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to worke, at leaſt many millions of children and people yet vnborne, ſhall beare me witneſſe, that in theſe dangers of the highest nature and ſtraine, J haue not bene defectiue: and that neither the ſubuerſions of States, nor the murthers of Kings, which may vnhappily betide hereafter, ſhall haue ſo free paſsage in the world for want of timely aduertiſement before. For touching my particular, my rest is vp, that one of the maynes for which God hath aduanced me vpon the loftie ſtage of the ſupreme Throne, is, that my words vttered from ſo eminent a place for Gods honour, moſt ſhamefully traduced and vilified in his owne Deputies and Lieutenants, might with greater facilitie be conceiued.</p>
               <p>Now touching <hi>France,</hi> faire was the hope which J conceiued of the States aſſembled in Parliament at <hi>Paris:</hi> That calling to minde the murthers of their Noble Kings, and the warres of the League which followed the Popes fulminations, as when a great ſtorme of haile powreth downe after a Thunder-cracke, and a world of writings addreſſed to iustifie the parricides, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thronings of kings, they would haue ioyned heads, hearts, &amp; hands together, to hammer out ſome apt and wholeſome remedy against ſo many fearefull attempts and practiſes. To my hope was added no little ioy, when I was giuen to vnderstand the third <hi>Eſtate</hi> had preferred an Article or Bill, the tenor and ſubstance whereof was concerning the meanes whereby the people might bee vnwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of this pernicious opinion; <hi>That Popes may toſſe the French King his Throne like a tennis ball,</hi> and <hi>that killing of Kings is an acte meritorious to the purchaſe of the crowne of Martyrdome.</hi> But in fine, the proiect was encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with ſucceſſe cleane coutrary to Expectation. For this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the third Estate, like a ſigh of libertie breathing her laſt,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:23110:213"/>ſerued onely ſo much the more to inthrall the Crowne, and to make the bondage more grieuous and ſenſible then before. Euen as thoſe medicines which worke no eaſe to the patient, doe leaue the diſeaſe in much worſe tearmes: ſo this remedy inuented and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by the third Eſtate, did onely exaſperate the preſent malady of the State; for ſo much as the operation and vertue of the wholeſome remedy was ouermatched with peccant humours, then ſtirred by the force of thwarting and croſsing oppoſition. Yea much better had it bene, the matter had not bene ſtirred at all, then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was once on foot and in motion, to giue the Trewth leaue to lye gaſping and ſprawling vnder the violence of a forraine faction. For the opinion by which the Crownes of Kings are made ſubiect vnto the Popes will and power, was then auowed in a moſt Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Aſſembly, by the auerment of a Prelate in great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and of no leſſe learning: He did not plead the cauſe as a priuate perſon, but as one by repreſentation that ſtood for the whole body of the Clergie; was there applauded, and ſeconded with approbation of the Nobilitie; no reſolution taken to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, or in barre to his plea. After praiſes and thankes from the Pope, followed the printing of his eloquent harangue or Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made in full Parliament: a ſet diſcourſe, maintaining Kings to be depoſeable by the Pope, if he ſpeake the word. The ſaid Oration was not onely Printed <hi>with the Kings priuiledge,</hi> but was likewiſe addreſſed to mee by the Author and Orator him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; who preſuppoſed the reading thereof would forſooth driue me to ſay, <hi>Lord Cardinall, in this high ſubiect your Honour hath ſatisfied me to the full.</hi> All this poyſed in the ballance of equall iudgement, why may not J trewly and freely affirme, the ſaid Eſtates aſſembled in Parliament, haue ſet Royall Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie vpon a doubtfull chance, or left it reſting vpon vncertaine tearmes: and that now if the doctrine there maintained by the Clergie ſhould beare any pawme, it may lawfully be doubted, who is King in <hi>France?</hi> For I make no queſtion, hee is but a titular King that raigneth onely at an others diſcretion, and whoſe Princely head the Pope hath power to bare of his Regall Crowne.
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:23110:214"/>In temporall matters, how can one be Soueraigne, that may be flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of all his Temporalties by any ſuperiour power? But let men at a neere ſight marke the pith and marrow of the Article propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the third Estate, and they ſhall ſoone perceiue the skilfull Architects thereof aymed onely to make their King a trew and reall King, to bee recogniſed for Soueraigne within his owne Realme, and that killing their King might no longer paſſe the muster of workes acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>But by the vehement instance and ſtrong current of the Clergie and Nobles, this was borne downe as a pernicious Article, as a cauſe of Schiſme, as a gate which openeth to all ſorts of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies: yea, there it was maintained tooth and naile, that in caſe the doctrine of this Article might goe for currant doctrine, it muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that for many aages paſt in ſequence, the Church hath beene the kingdome of Antichrist, and the ſynagogue of Satan. The Pope vpon ſo good iſſue of the cauſe, had reaſon, J trow, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe his Letters of triumph vnto the Nobilitie and Clergie, who had ſo farre aprrooued themſelues faithfull to his Holineſſe; and to vaunt withall, that hee had nipped Christian Kings in the Crowne, that hee had giuen them checke with mate, through the magnanimous reſolution of this courageous Nobilitie, by whoſe braue making head, the third Estate had beene ſo valiantly forced to giue ground. Jn a ſcornefull reproach hee qualified the Deputies of the third Estate,
<note place="margin">I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers parts, that in the Popes letters to the Nobitie theſe wordes were extant, howſoeuer they haue bin left out in the impreſſion, &amp; raſed out of the copies of the ſaid let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note>

For the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie denie themſelues to haue any ranke among the Subiects of the King: they ſtand for a Soueraigne out of the Kingdome, to whom as to the Lord Paramount they owe ſuite and ſeruice: they are bound to aduance that Monarchie, to the bodie whereof they properly apperteine as parts or members, as elſewhere I haue
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:23110:214"/>written more at large. But for the Nobilitie, the Kings right arme, to prostitute and ſet as it were to ſale the dignitie of their King, as if the arme ſhould giue a thruſt vnto the head; J ſay for the Nobilitie to hold and maintaine euen in Parliament, their King is liable to depoſition by any forreine power or Potentate, may it not paſse among the ſtrangeſt miracles and rareſt wonders of the world? For that once granted, this conſequence is good and neceſſarie; That in caſe the King, once lawfully depoſed, ſhall ſtand vpon the defenſiue, and hold out for his right, he may then lawfully be murthered. Let mee then here freely profeſſe my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and this it is: That now the French Nobilitie may ſeeme to haue ſome reaſon to diſrobe themſelues of their titles, and to transferre them by reſignation vnto the third Eſtate. For that body of that third Eſtate alone hath caried a right noble heart: in as much as the could neither be tickled with promiſes, nor ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by threatnings, from reſolute ſtanding to thoſe fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall points and reaſons of State, which moſt concerne the honour of their King, and the ſecuritie of his perſon.</p>
               <p>Of all the Clergie, the man that hath most abandoned, or ſet his honour to ſale, the man to whom France is least obliged, is the <hi>Lord Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Perron:</hi> a man otherwiſe inferiour to few in matter of learning, and in the grace of a ſweete ſtyle. This man in two ſeuerall Orations, whereof the one was pronounced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Nobilitie, the other had audience before the third Eſtate, hath ſet his best wits on worke, to draw that doctrine into all ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and infamie, which teacheth Kings to be indepoſeable by the Pope. To this purpoſe hee termes the ſame doctrine, a breeder of Schiſmes, a gate that openeth to make way, and to giue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance vnto all hereſies; in briefe, a doctrine to bee held in ſo high a degree of deteſtation, that rather then he and his fellow-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops will yeeld to the ſigning thereof, they will bee contented like Martyrs to burne at a ſtake. At which reſolution, or obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie rather in his opinion, I am in a manner amaſed, more then I can be mooued for the like <hi>brauado</hi> in many other: foraſmuch as hee was many yeeres together, a follower of the late King, euen when
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:23110:215"/>the King followed a contrary Religion, and was depoſed by the Pope: as alſo becauſe not long before, in a certaine Aſſemblie hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at the Iacobins in Paris, hee withſtood the Popes Nuntio to his face, when the ſaid Nuntio laboured to make this doctrine, touching the Popes temporall Soueraigntie, paſſe for an Article of Faith. But in both Orations, hee ſingeth a contrary ſong, and from his owne mouth paſseth ſentence of condemnation againſt his former courſe and profeſsion. J fuppoſe, not without ſollide iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; as one that heerein hath well accommodated himſelfe to the times: For as in the reigne of the late King, hee durst not offer to broach this doctrine (ſuch was his fore-wit;) ſo now he is bold to proclaime and publiſh it in Parliament vnder the reigne of the ſaid Kings ſonne; whoſe tender yeeres and late ſucceſsion to the Crowne, doe make him lie the more open to iniuries, and the more facill to be circumuented: Such is now his afterwiſedome.</p>
               <p>Of theſe two Orations, that made in preſence of the Nobilitie he hath, for feare of incurring the Popes diſpleaſure, cautelouſly ſuppreſſed. For therein he hath beene ſomewhat prodigall in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming this doctrine maintained by the Clergie, to bee but proble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall; and in taking vpon him to auouch, that Catholikes of my Kingdome are bound to yeeld me the honour of obedience: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the other ſide, he is not ignorant, how this doctrine of depoſing Princes and Kings, the Pope holdeth for meerely neceſſarie, and approoueth not by any meanes Alleagiance to bee performed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee by the Catholikes of my Kingdome. Yea if credit may be giuen vnto the abridgement of his other Oration publiſhed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he paralells the Popes power in receiuing honours in the name of the Church, with the power of the Venetian Duke in receiuing honours in the name of that moſt renowned Rebublike; no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile that when this Oration was diſpatched to the preſſe, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ſame to be gelded of this clauſe and other like, for feare of giuing his Holineſſe any offenſiue distaſte.</p>
               <p>His pleaſure therefore was, and content withall, that his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion imparted to the third Estate, ſhould be put in Print, and of his courteſie he vouchſafed to addreſse vnto me a copie of the ſame.
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:23110:215"/>Which after J had peruſed, J foorthwith well perceiued, what and how great diſcrepance there is betweene one man that perorateth from the ingenuous and ſincere diſpoſition of a ſound heart, and an other that flaunteth in flouriſhing ſpeech with inward checkes of his owne conſcience: For euery where he contradicts himſelfe, and ſeemes to be afraid leſt men ſhould picke out his right meaning.</p>
               <p>First,
<note place="margin">In 12. ſeuerall paſſages the L. Card. ſeemeth to ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Pag. 85.</note> he grants this Question is not hither to decided by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, or by the Decrees of the ancient Church, or by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogie of other Eccleſiasticall proceedings: and neuertheleſse hee confidently doeth affirme, that whoſoeuer maintaine this doctrine to be wicked and abhominable, that Popes haue no power to put Kings by their ſupreame Thrones, they teach men to beleeue, there hath not bene any Church for many aages past, and that indeed the Church is the very Synagogue of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he exhorts his hearers to hold this doctrine at least for problematicall, and not neceſsary: and yet herein he calls them to all humble ſubmiſsion vnto the iudgement of the Pope and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, by whom the cauſe hath bene already put out of all question, as out of all hunger and cold.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he doeth auerre, in caſe this Article be authorized, it makes the Pope in good conſequence to bee the Antichrist:
<note place="margin">Pag. 99.</note> and yet he grants that many of the French are tolerated by the Pope to diſſent in this point from his Holineſse; prouided, their doctrine be not propoſed as neceſſary, and materiall to faith; As if the Pope in any ſort gaue toleration to hold any doctrine contrary to his owne, and moſt of all that doctrine which by conſequence inferres himſelfe to be the Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he proteſteth forwardneſſe to vndergoe the flames of Martyrdome, rather then to ſigne this doctrine, which teacheth Kings Crownes to ſit faſter on their heads, then to be ſtirred by any Papal power whatſoeuer: and yet ſaith withall, the Pope winketh at the French, by his toleration to hold this dogmaticall point for problematicall. And by this meanes, the Martyrdome that hee affecteth in this cauſe, will prooue but a problematicall Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whereof queſtion might grow very well, whether it were to
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:23110:216"/>be mustered with grieuous crimes, or with phreneticall paſsions of the braine, or with deſerued puniſhments.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, he denounceth Anathema, diſchargeth maledictions like haile-ſhot, againſt parricides of Kings: and yet elſewhere hee layes himſelfe open to ſpeake of Kings onely ſo long as they ſtand Kings. But who doeth not know that a King depoſed is no longer King? And ſo that limme of Satan, which murthered <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>III.</hi> then vn-king'd by the Pope, did not ſtabbe a King to death.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, he doeth not allow a King to be made away by murder: and yet he thinks it not much out of the way, to take away al meanes whereby he might be able to ſtand in defence of his life.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly,
<note place="margin">Pag. 95.97.</note> hee abhorreth killing of Kings by apposted throat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutting, for feare lest body and ſoule ſhould periſh in the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant: and yet he doth not miſlike their killing in a pitcht field, and to haue them ſlaughtered in a ſet battaile: For he preſuppoſeth, no doubt out of his charitable mind, that by this meanes the ſoule of a poore King ſo diſpatched out of the way, ſhall instantly flie vp to heauen.</p>
               <p>Eightly, he ſaith a King depoſed, retaineth ſtil a certaine internal habitude and politike impreſsion, by vertue and efficacie whereof he may, being once reformed and become a new man, be restored to the lawfull vſe and practiſe of Regalitie. Whereby hee would beare vs in hand, that when a forraine Prince hath inuaded and rauenouſly ſeiſed the kingdome into his hands, he will not onely take pittie of his predeceſſour to ſaue his life, but will alſo proue ſo kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, vpon fight of his repentance, to reſtore his kingdome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fraud or guile.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, he ſaith euery where in his Diſcourſe, that he dealeth not in the cauſe, otherwiſe then as a problematicall diſcourſer, and without any reſolution one way or other: and yet with might and maine hee contends for the opinion, that leaues the States and Crownes of Kings controulable by the Pope: refutes obiections, propounds the authoritie of Popes and Councils, by name the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran Councill vnder <hi>Innocent. III.</hi> as alſo the conſent of the Church. And to croſſe the Churches iudgement, is, in his opinion
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:23110:216"/>to bring in ſchiſme, and to leaue the world without a Church for many hundred yeeres together: which (to my vnderstanding) is to ſpeake with reſolution, and without all heſitation.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, he acknowledgeth none other cauſe of ſufficient vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie for the depoſing of a King, beſides herefie, apostaſie, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie: neuertheleſſe that Popes haue power to diſplace Kings for herefie and apostaſie, hee proueth by examples of Kings whom the Pope hath curbed with depoſition, not for hereſie, but for matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall cauſes, for ciuill pretences, and for lacke of capacitie.</p>
               <p>Eleuenthly, hee alledgeth euery where paſsages, as well of holy Scripture, as of the Fathers and moderne hiſtories; but ſo imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and with ſo little trewth, as hereafter wee ſhall cauſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that for a man of his deepe learning and knowledge, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not poſsible ſo to ſpeake out of his iudgement.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, whereas all this hath bene hudled and heaped together into one maſſe, to currie with the Pope: yet hee ſuffereth diuers points to fall from his lips, which may well distaſt his Holineſſe in the highest degree. As by name, where he prefers the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Councill before that of the Pope, and makes his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inferiour to the iudgement of the French; as in fit place here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhalbe ſhewed. Againe, where he repreſenteth to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers the decrees of Popes and Councils already paſſed concerning this noble ſubiect; and yet affirmes that he doth not debate the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but as a Questionist, and without reſolution: As if a Cardinal ſhould be afraid to be poſitiue, and to ſpeake in peremptory ſtraines, after Popes and Councils haue once decided the Question: Or as if a man ſhould perorate vpon hazard, in a cauſe for the honour whereof, he would make no difficultie to ſuffer Martyrdome. Adde hereunto, that his Lordſhip hath alwayes taken the contrary part heretofore, and this totall must needs ariſe, that before the third Estate, his lips looked one way, and his conſcience another.</p>
               <p>All theſe points, by the diſcourſe which is to follow, and by the ripping vp of his Oration (which by Gods aſsistance J will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take) tending to the reproch of Kings, and the ſubuerſion of kingdomes, J confidently ſpeake it, ſhalbe made manifest. Yet doe
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:23110:217"/>J not conceiue it can any way make for my honour, to enter the liſts against a Cardinall: For J am not ignorant how farre a Cardinals Hat, commeth vnder the Crowne and Scepter of a King; For well J wot vnto what ſublimitie the Scripture hath exalted Kings, when it ſtyles them Gods; Whereas the dignitie of a Cardinall is but a late vpstart inuention of man;
<note place="margin">In the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie.</note> as J haue elſewhere prooued. But J haue imbarqued my ſelfe in this action, mooued thereunto: First, by the common interest of Kings in the cauſe it ſelfe: Then by the L. Cardinall, who ſpeaketh not in this Oration as a priuate perſon, but as one repreſenting the body of the Clergie and Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, by whom the cauſe hath bene wonne, and the garland borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the third Eſtate: Againe, by mine owne particular; becauſe he is pleaſed to take me vp for a ſower of diſſention, and a perſecutour, vnder whom the Church is hardly able to fetch her breath; yea, for one by whom the Catholikes of my Kingdome are compelled to endure all ſorts of puniſhments; and withal he tearmes this Article of the third Estate, a monster with a fiſhes taile that came ſwimming out of England: Laſt of all, by the preſent ſtate of France; becauſe France being now reduced to ſo miſerable tearmes, that it is now become a crime for a Frenchman to ſtand for his King; it is a neceſſary duetie of her neighbours to ſpeake in her cauſe, and to make triall whether they can put life into the trewth now dying, and ready to be buried by the power of violence, that it may reſound and ring againe from remote regions.</p>
               <p>J haue no purpoſe once to touch many prettie toyes which the ridges of his whole booke are ſowen withall: Such are his allegations of <hi>Pericles, Ageſilaus, Ariſtotle, Minos,</hi> the <hi>Druides,</hi> the French Ladies, <hi>Hannibal, Pindarus,</hi> and Poeticall fables: All reſembling the red and blew flowers that pester the corne when it ſtandeth in the fields, where they are more noy ſome to the growing crop, then beautifull to the beholding eye. Such pettie matters, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all beſeemed the dignitie of the Aſſembly, and of the maine ſubiect, or of the Orator himſelfe: For it was no <hi>Decorum</hi> to enter the Stage with a <hi>Pericles</hi> in his mouth, but with the ſacred Name of God; nor ſhould hee haue marſhalled the paſſage of a Royall
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:23110:217"/>Poet, after the example of an heathen Oratour.</p>
               <p>Neither will J giue any touch to his conceit of the Romane conquests,
<note place="margin">2 Pag. 4.</note> which the L. Cardinall bestoweth in the list of Gods graces and temporall bleſsings, as a recompence of their zeale to the ſeruice and worſhip of Idols: As if God were a recompencer of wickednes, or as if the forcible eiecting of Tenants out of their farmes and other poſſeſsions, might be reckoned among the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God.</p>
               <p>Nor to that of the <hi>Mileſian</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgins,
<note place="margin">Pag. 7. &amp; 8.</note> dragged ſtark-naked after they were dead; which the L. Cardinall drawes into his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe for an example of the eternall torments denounced by the Lawes Eccleſiasticall, to be inflicted after this life.</p>
               <p>Nor to his expoſition of the word <hi>Problematicall;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> where he giueth to vnderstand that by Problematicall, hee meaneth ſuch things as are of no neceſsitie to matter of faith; and in caſe men ſhall beleeue the contradictory of the ſaid points, they are not bound for ſuch beleefe, to vndergoe the ſolemne curſe of the Church, and the loſse of communion: Whereas <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE L. Cardinall euen in the firſt paſſage of his Oration, hath laid a firme foundation, <hi>That Eccleſiaſtics in France are more deepely obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the King, then the Nobilitie, and third Estate:</hi> His reaſon; Becauſe the Clergie doe ſweetly enioy their dignities and promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with all their infinite wealth, of the Kings meere grace, without all danger, and with faire immunities; whereas the other two Orders hold their offices by a chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and burdenſome title or tenure, euen to the great expence of their blood, and of their ſubſtance. But ſee now, how looſe and weake a frame he hath erected and pinned together, vpon his firme and ſolide founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the third Eſtate is to lay all care to prouide remedies againſt appoſted cut-throats, vpon the Clergy; and the ſaid remedies (as he bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirms) muſt be deriued from the laws of conſcience, which may carry an effectuall acting or operatiue efficacie vpon the ſoule, and not from ciuil or temporall puniſhments. Now this conſequence limpeth like a lame creple after the premiſes: For it is no vſuall and common matter, to ſee men that are deepeſt in obligation, performe their duties and couenants with moſt fidelity. Againe, were it graunted the Clergie had well hitherto demonſtrated their carefull watching ouer the life and honour of their Prince; yet is it not for ſpirituall puniſhments thundred by Eccleſiaſtics, to bind the hands of the ciuill Magiſtrate, nor to ſtop the current of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:23110:218"/>puniſhments: which ordinarily doe carrie a greater force and vertue to the bridling of the wicked, then the apprehenſion of Gods iudgement.</p>
               <p>The third Eſtate therefore, by whom all the officers of France are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly repreſented, as to whom the adminiſtration of iuſtice and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Kings rights and Honour doth appertaine, can deſerue no blame in carrying ſo watchfull an eye, by their wholeſome remedie to prouide for the ſafetie of the King, and for the dignitie of his Crowne. For if the Clergie ſhall not ſtand to their tackle, but ſhrinke when it commeth to the puſh of their duetie; who ſhall charge themſelues with carefull foreſight and preuention of miſchiefes? Shall not the people? Now, haue not all the calamities, which the third Eſtate haue ſought prouidently to preuent; haue they not all ſprung from the Clergie, as from their proper and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fountaine? From whence did the laſt ciuill warres, wherein a world of blood was not more profuſely then prodigiouſly and vnnaturally ſpilt, and wherein the parricide of King <hi>Henrie III.</hi> was impiouſly and abominably committed: from whence did thoſe bloodie warres proceed, but from the depoſing of the ſaid King by the Head of the Church? Were they not Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, Curats, and Confeſſours; were they not Eccleſiaſtics, who partly by ſeditious preachments, and partly by ſecret confeſſions, powred many a iarre of oyle vpon this flame? Was not he that killed the forenamed King, was not he one of the Clergie? Was not <hi>Guignard</hi> a Ieſuite? Was not <hi>Iohn Chastel</hi> brought vp in the ſame ſchoole? Did not <hi>Rauaillac</hi> that monſter of men, vpon interrogatories made at his examination; among the reſt, by whom he had beene ſo diabolically tempted and ſtirred vp to his moſt execrable attempt and act of extreme horror: did not he referre his exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to the Sermons made the Lent next before, where they might be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied concerning the cauſes of his abominable vndertaking and execution? Are not <hi>Bellarmine, Eudaemonoiohannes, Suarez, Becanus, Mariana,</hi> with ſuch other monſters, who teach the doctrine of parricides, vphold the craft of Ianus-like Equiuocations in Courts of Iuſtice, and in ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions: are they not all Clerics? are not all their bookes approoued and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, as it were by a corporation or groſſe companie of Doctors, with their ſignes manuel to the ſaid bookes? What were the heads, the chiefe promoters, the complices of the powder-conſpiracie in my Kingdome? were they not Eccleſiaſtics? Hath not <hi>Faux</hi> by name, a confederate of the ſame damned crew; hath not he ſtoutly ſtood to the gunners part, which then he was to act in that moſt dolefull Tragedie, with aſſeueration of a conſcience well aſſured and ſetled, touching the lawfulneſſe of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe? Did he not yeild this reaſon? to wit, becauſe he had bin armed with inſtruction of musket proofe in the caſe, before he made paſſage ouer from the Low Countries? Is it not alſo the generall beleefe of that Order, that Clerics are exempted from the condition of Subiects to the King? Nay,
<note place="margin">Pag. 7.</note> is it not confeſſed by the L. Cardinall himſelfe, that King-killers haue ingaged
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:23110:219"/>themſelues to vndertake the deteſtable act of parricide vnder a falſe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Religion, as beeing inſtructed by their ſchoolemaſters in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? And who were they but Eccleſiaſticall perſons? All this preſuppoſed as matter of trewth, I draw this concluſion: Howſoeuer no ſmall number of the French Clergie may perhaps beare the affection of louing Subiects to their King, and may not ſuffer the Clericall character to deface the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of naturall allegiance; yet, for ſo much as the Order of Clerics is dipped in a deeper die, and beareth a worſe tincture of daungerous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes then the other Orders; the third Eſtate had beene greatly wanting to their excellent prouidence and wiſedome, if they ſhould haue relinquiſhed and transferred the care of deſignements and proiects for the life of their King, and the ſafety of his Crowne, to the Clergiealone. Moreouer, the Clergie ſtandeth bound to referre the iudgement of all matters in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, to the ſentence of the Pope, in this cauſe beeing a partie, and one that pretendeth Crownes to depend vpon his Mitre. What hope then might the third Eſtate conceiue, that his Holineſſe would paſſe againſt his owne cauſe, when his iudgement of the controuerſie had beene ſundrie times before publiſhed and teſtified to the world? And whereas the plot or modell of remedies proiected by the third Eſtate, and the Kings Officers, hath not prooued ſortable in the euent: was it becauſe the ſaid remedies were not good and lawfull? No verily: but becauſe the Clergie refuſed to become contributors of their duty and meanes to the grand ſeruice. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for that after the burning of bookes, addreſſed to iuſtifie rebellious people, traytors, and parricides of Kings; neuertheleſſe the authors of the ſaid bookes are winked at, and backt with fauour. Laſtly, for that ſome wretched parricides drinke off the cuppe of publike iuſtice; whereas to the firebrands of ſedition, the ſowers of this abominable doctrine, no man ſaith ſo much as blacke is their eye.</p>
               <p>It ſufficiently appeareth, as I ſupoſe, by the former paſſage, that his Lordſhip exhorting the third Eſtate to referre the whole care of this Regall cauſe vnto the Clergie, hath tacked his frame of weake ioynts and tenons to a very worthy but wrong foundation.
<note place="margin">Page 9.</note> Howbeit, he laboureth to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie his exhortation with a more weake and feeble reaſon: For to make good his proiect he affirmes, that matters and maximes out of all doubt and queſtion, may not be ſhuffled together with points in controuerſie. Now his rules indubitable are two: The firſt, It is not lawfull to murther Kings for any cauſe whatſoeuer: This he confirmeth by the example of <hi>Saul</hi> (as he ſaith) depoſed from his Throne, whoſe life or limbs <hi>Dauid</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe durſt not once hurt or wrong for his life:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Conſtan. Seſſ.</hi> 15.</note> Likewiſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes the ſame by a Decree of the Councill held at Conſtance: His other point indubitable; The Kings of France are Soueraignes in all Temporall Soueraigntie, within the French Kingdome, and hold not by fealtie either of the Pope, as hauing receiued or obliged their Crownes vpon ſuch tenure and condition, or of any other Prince in the whole world; Which point,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:23110:219"/>neuertheleſſe he takes not for certaine and indubitable, but onely according to humane and hiſtoricall certaintie. Now a third point he makes to be ſo full of controuerſie, and ſo farre within the circle of diſputable queſtions, as it may not be drawne into the ranke of claſſicall and authenticall points, for feare of making a certaine point doubtfull, by ſhuffling and iumbling therewith ſome point in controuerſie. Now the queſtion ſo diſputable, as he pretendeth, is this: A Chriſtian Prince breakes his oath ſolemnely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to God, both to liue and to die in the Catholique Religion: Say this Prince turnes Arrian, or Mahometan, fals to proclaime open warre, and to wage battell with Ieſus Chriſt: Whether may ſuch a Prince be declared to haue loſt his Kingdome, and who ſhall declare the Subiects of ſuch a Prince to be quit of their oath of allegiance? The L. Cardinall holds the affirmatiue, and makes no bones to maintaine, that all other parts of the Catholique Church, yea the French Church, euen from the firſt birth of her Theologicall Schooles, to <hi>Caluins</hi> time and teaching, haue profeſſed that ſuch a Prince may bee lawfully remooued from his Throne by the Pope, and by the Councill: and ſuppoſe the contrarie doctrine were the very Quinteſſence or ſpirit of trewth, yet might it not in caſe of faith be vrged and preſſed otherwiſe then by way of problematicall diſceptation. That is the ſumme of his Lordſhips ample diſcourſe: The refuting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I am conſtrained to put off, and referre vnto an other place; becauſe he hath ſerued vs with the ſame diſhes ouer and ouer againe. There we ſhall ſee the L. Cardinall maketh way to the diſpatching of Kings after depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that <hi>Saul</hi> was not depoſed, as he hath preſumed: that in the Councill of Conſtance there is nothing to the purpoſe of murthering Soueraigne Princes: that his Lordſhip, ſuppoſing the French King may be depriued of his Crowne by a ſuperiour power, doth not hold his liege Lord to be So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraine in France: that by the poſition of the French Church from aage to aage, the Kings of France are not ſubiect vnto any cenſure of depoſition by the Pope: that his Holineſſe hath no iuſt and lawfull pretence to produce, that any Chriſtian King holds of him by fealtie, or is obliged to doe the Pope homage for his Crowne.</p>
               <p>Well then, for the purpoſe; he dwelleth onely vpon the third point pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended queſtionable, and this hee affirmeth: If any ſhall condemne, or wrappe vnder the ſolemne curſe, the abettours of the Popes power to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king lawfull and Soueraigne Kings; the ſame ſhall runne vpon foure dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rocks of apparent incongruities and abſurdities.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſhall offer to force and entangle the conſciences of many deuout perſons: For he ſhall binde them to beleeue and ſweare that doctrine,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

               <q>
                  <p>Secondly,

For this doctrine beeing held and profeſſed by all other Catholiques; how can we declare it repugnant vnto Gods word; how can wee hold it impious; how can wee account it deteſtable, but wee ſhall renounce communion with the Head and other members of the Church; yea, we ſhall confeſſe the Church in all aages to haue bene the Synagogue of Satan, and the ſpouſe of the Deuill?</p>

               <p>The L. Cardinall ſpends his whole diſcourſe in confirmation of theſe foure heads, which wee now intend to ſift in order, and demonſtratiuely to prooue that all the ſaid inconueniences are meere nullities, matters of imagination, and built vpon falſe preſuppoſitions. But before wee come to the maine, the reader is to be enformed and aduertiſed, that his Lordſhip ſetteth a falſe gloſſe vpon the queſtion; and propounds the caſe not onely contrary to the trewth of the ſubiect in controuerſie, but alſo to the Popes owne minde and meaning: For he reſtraines the Popes power to depoſe Kings, onely to caſes of Hereſie, Apoſtaſie, and perſecuting of the Church; whereas Popes extend their power to a further diſtance. They depoſe Princes for infringing, or in any ſort diminiſhing the Priuiledges of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries: witneſſe <hi>Gregorie</hi> the firſt in the pretended Charter granted to the Abbey of S. <hi>Medard</hi> at <hi>Soiſſons;</hi> the ſaid Charter beeing annexed to his Epiſtles in the rere. The ſame hee teſtifieth in his Epiſtle to <hi>Senator,</hi> by name the tenth of the eleuenth booke.

Emperours were fallen, when they were ſmitten with Papall fulminations, euen to the depriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Imperiall Thrones. What? was it for Hereſie or Apoſtaſie, that Pope <hi>Martin</hi> IV. bare ſo hard a hand againſt <hi>Peter</hi> King of Arragon, that he acquitted and releaſed the Aragonnois from their oath of Alleagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to <hi>Peter</hi> their lawfull King? Was it for Hereſie or Apoſtaſie, for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſme or Mahumetiſme, that <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. ſo good a King and Father of his Countrey, was put downe by <hi>Iulius</hi> the II? Was it for Hereſie or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie, that <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. vſurped a power againſt <hi>Henrie</hi> III. euen ſo farre as to denounce him vnkingd; the iſſue whereof was the parricide of that good King, and the moſt wofull deſolation of a moſt flouriſhing Kingdome? But his Lordſhip beſt liked to worke vpon that ground, which to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew and appearance, is the moſt beautifull cauſe that can be alleaged for the diſhonouring of Kings by the weapon of depoſition: making himſelfe to beleeue that he acted the part of an Orator before perſonages not much acquainted with ancient and moderne hiſtories, and ſuch as little vnderſtood the ſtate of the queſtion then in hand. It had therefore beene a good warrant for his Lordſhip, to haue brought ſome authenticall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument from the Pope, whereby the French might haue beene ſecured, that his Holineſſe renounceth all other cauſes auouchable for the degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Kings; and that he will henceforth reſt in the caſe of Hereſie, for the turning of Kings out of their Free-hold: as alſo that his Holineſſe by the ſame or like inſtrument might haue certified his pleaſure, that hee will not hereafter make himſelfe Iudge, whether Kings bee tainted with damnable Hereſie, or free from Hereticall infection. For that were to make himſelfe both Iudge and Plaintiffe, that it might be in his power to call that doctrine Hereticall, which is pure Orthodoxe: and all for this end, to make himſelfe maſter of the Kingdome, and there to ſettle a Succeſſour, who receiuing the Crowne of the Popes free gift and grant, might be tyed thereby to depend altogether vpon his Holineſſe. Hath not Pope <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> VIII. declared in his proud Letters all thoſe to be Heretiques, that dare vndertake to affirme, the collating of Prebends appertemeth to the King? It was that Popes groſſe errour, not in the fact, but in the right. The like crime forſooth was by Popes imputed to the vnhappy Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Henrie</hi> IV. And what was the iſſue of the ſaid imputation? The ſonne is inſtigated thereby to rebell againſt his father, and to impeach the interrement of his dead corps, who neuer in his life had beate his braines to trouble the ſweet waters of Theologicall fountaines.

Wherein, to my vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the L. Cardinall voluntarily giueth ouer the ſuite: For the Church in the time of the Apoſtles, their diſciples, and ſucceſſors, for 500. yeeres together, was no more ignorant what authoritie the Church is to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge ouer Emperours and Kings, then at any time ſince in any ſucceeding aage; in which as pride hath ſtill flowed to the height of a full Sea, ſo puritie of religion and manners hath kept for the moſt part at a lowe water marke. Which point is the rather to be conſidered, for that during the firſt 500. yeeres, the Church groned vnder the heauy burthen, both of heathen Emperours, and of hereticall Kings; the Viſigot Kings in Spaine, and the Vandals in Affrica. Of whoſe diſpleaſure the Pope had ſmall reaſon or cauſe to ſtand in any feare, beeing ſo remote from their dominions, and no way vnder the lee of their Soueraigntie.</p>

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:23110:221"/>the great Empreſſe and Senate ſought by violent courſes and practiſes to make him yeeld.

To this the L. Cardinall addes, that when the ſaid Emperour was minded to choppe the poiſon of his hereticall aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into the publique formes of diuine ſeruice, then the people of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople made an vproare againſt <hi>Anastaſius</hi> their Emperour; and one of his Commanders by force of armes, conſtrained him to call backe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Biſhops whom he had ſent into baniſhment before.</p>
                  <p>In this firſt example the L.

But graunt it a trewth; yet <hi>Anaſta ſius</hi> excommunicated by Pope <hi>Symmachus,</hi> is not <hi>Anastaſius</hi> depoſed by Pope <hi>Symmachus.</hi> And to make a full anſwere, I ſay further, that excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation denounced by a forraine Biſhop, againſta party not beeing within the limits of his iuriſdiction, or one of his owne flocke, was not any barre to the party from the communion of the Church, but onely a kind of publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that he the ſaid Biſhop in his particular, would hold no further communion with any ſuch party.</p>

But I am not minded to make any deepe ſearch or inquiſition, into the titles of the Lords of Yue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tot; whoſe honourable priuiledges and titles are the moſt honourable badges and cognizances of their Anceſtours, and of ſome remarkeable ſeruice done to the Crowne of France: ſo farre I take them to differ from a ſatisfaction for ſinne: And for the purpoſe I onely affirme, that were the credit of this hiſtorie beyond all exception, yet makes it nothing to the preſent queſtion, Wherein the power of depoſing, and not of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating ſupreme Kings, is debated.

Nay, doubtleſſe it was rather a meanes to eleuate and aduance the dignitie of the Crowne of France, and to ſtyle the French King, a King of Kings, as one that was able to giue the qualitie of King, to all the reſt of the Nobles and Gentry of his Kingdome.

<pb n="401" facs="tcp:23110:222"/>words bee theſe: <hi>If any King, Prelate, Iudge, or any other Secular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, informed of this our Conſtitution, ſhall preſume to goe or doe contrary thereunto, let him bee cast downe from his power and dignitie.</hi> I anſwere; the Lord Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall heere wrongs himſelſe very much, in taking imprecations for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. Might not euen the meaneſt of the people vſe the ſame tenour of words, and ſay? If any ſhall touch the life, or the moſt ſacred Maieſtie of our Kings, be he Emperour, or be he Pope, let him bee accurſed; let him fall from his eminent place of authoritie; let him loſe his dignitie; let him tumble into beggerie, diſeaſes, and all kindes of calamities? I forbeare to ſhew how eaſie a matter it is for Monkes, to forge titles after their owne humour, and to their owne liking, for the vpholding and maintaining of their priuiledges. As for the purpoſe, the ſame <hi>Gregorie</hi> citeth in the end of his Epiſtles another priuiledge, of the like ſtuffe and ſtampe to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, granted to the Abbey of <hi>S. Medard</hi> at Soiſſons: It is fenced with a like clauſe to the other; But of how great vntrewth, and of how little weight it is, the very date that it beareth, makes manifeſt proofe: For it runs, Dated the yeere of our Lords Incarnation 593. the 11. Indiction; whereas the 10. Indiction agreeth to the yeere 593. Beſides, it was not <hi>Gregories</hi> maner to date his Epiſtles according to the yeere of the Lord. Againe, the ſaid priuiledge was ſigned by the Biſhops of Alexandria and Carthage, who neuer knew (as may well bee thought) whether any ſuch Abbey of S. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,</hi> or citie of Soiſſons, was euer built in the world. Moreouer, they ſigned in the thickeſt of a crowd as it were of Italian Biſhops. Laſtly, hee that ſhall reade in this <hi>Gregories</hi> Epiſtles, with what ſpirit of reuerence and humilitie he ſpeaketh of Emperours, will hardly beleeue that euer hee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelfe with authoritie to giue or to take away Kingdomes.

                  <p>Heere are now 712. yeeres expired after the birth of Ieſus Chriſt: in all which long tract of time, the L. Cardinal hath not light vpon any inſtance, which might make for his purpoſe with neuer ſo little ſhew: For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:23110:223"/>of the Emperor <hi>Philippicus</hi> by the Cardinal alledged next in ſequence,
<note place="margin">Examp. 5.</note> belongeth to the yeere 713. And thus lies the hiſtorie: This Emperour <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippicus Bardanes,</hi> was a profeſſed enemie to the worſhipping of Images, and commanded them to be broken in pieces. In that very time the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire was ouerthrowen in the Weſt, and ſore ſhaken by the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenes in the Eaſt. Beſides thoſe miſeries, the Emperour was alſo incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with a ciuill and inteſtine warre. The greateſt part of Italie was then ſeized by the Lombards, and the Emperour in Italie had nothing left ſaue onely the Exarchat of Rauenna, and the Dutchie of Rome, then halfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned by reaſon of the Emperours want of forces. Pope <hi>Constantine</hi> gripes this occaſion whereon to ground his greatneſſe, and to ſhake off the yoke of the Emperour his Lord, Vndertakes againſt <hi>Philippicus</hi> the cauſe of Images: by a Councel declares the Emperour Heretique: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibites his reſcripts or coine to bee receiued, and to goe current in Rome: Forbids his Imperiall ſtatue to bee ſet vp in the Temple, according to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtome: The tumult groweth to a height: The Pope is principall promoter of the tumult: In the heate of the tumult the Exarche of Rauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na loſeth his life. Here ſee now the mutinie of a ſubiect againſt his Prince, to pull from him by force and violence a citie of his Empire. But who ſeeth in all this any ſentence of depoſition from the Imperiall dignitie? Nay, the Pope then miſſed the cuſhion, and was diſappointed vtterly of his purpoſe: The citie of Rome ſtood firme, and continued ſtill in their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>About ſome 12. yeeres after,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Exemp.</hi> 6.</note> the Emperour <hi>Leo Iſauricus</hi> (whom the Lord of Perron calleth <hi>Iconoclaſt</hi>) falles to fight it out at ſharpe, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute worſhippers of Images with all extremitie. Vpon this occaſion, Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> 2. then treading in the ſteps of his predeceſſor, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the citie of Rome to be but weakely prouided of men or munition, and the Emperour to haue his hands full in other places, found ſuch meanes to make the citie riſe in rebellious armes againſt the Emperour, that he made himſelfe in ſhort time maſter thereof. Thus farre the Lord Cardinall, whereunto my anſwere for ſatisfaction is; that degrading an Emperour from his Imperiall dignitie, and reducing a citie to reuolt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her Maſter, that a man at laſt may carry the piece himſelfe, and make himſelfe Lord thereof, are two ſeuerall actions of ſpeciall difference. If the free-hold of the citie had beene conueied to ſome other by the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuing the Emperour, as proprietarie thereof, this example might haue challenged ſome credit at leaſt in ſhew: but ſo to inuade the citie to his owne vſe, and ſo to ſeize on the right and authority of another, what is it but open rebellion, and notorious ambition? For it is farre from Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call cenſure, when the ſpirituall Paſtor of ſoules forſooth, pulles the cloake of a poore ſinner from his backe by violence, or cuts his purſe, and thereby appropriates an other mans goods to his priuate vſe. It is to be obſerued withall, that when the Emperours were not of ſufficient ſtrength, and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:23110:223"/>Popes had power to beard and to braue Emperours, then theſe Papall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes were firſt ſet on foot. This Emperour notwithſtanding, turned head and peckt againe: his Lieutenant entred Rome, and <hi>Gregorie</hi> 3. ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to this <hi>Gregorie</hi> 2. was glad to honour the ſame Emperour with ſtyle and title of his Lord: witneſſe two ſeuerall Epiſtles of the ſaid <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> 3. written to <hi>Boniface,</hi> and ſubſcribed in this forme:

                  </p>
                  <p>The L. Cardinall with no leſſe abuſe alleadgeth Pope <hi>Zacharie,</hi> by whom the French, as he affirmeth, were abſolued of the oath of all egiance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſtood bound to <hi>Childeric</hi> their King: And for this inſtance, he ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon the teſtimonie of <hi>Paulus Aemilius,</hi> and <hi>du Tillet,</hi> a paire of late writers. But by authors more neere that aage wherein <hi>Childeric</hi> raigned, it is more trewly teſtified, that it was a free and voluntarie act of the French, onely asking the aduiſe of Pope <hi>Zacharie,</hi> but requiring neither leaue nor abſolution. <hi>Ado</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> in his Chronicles hath it after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>The French, following the Counſell of Embaſſadors, and of Pope</hi> Zachary, <hi>elected</hi> Pepin <hi>their King, and eſtabliſhed him in the Kingdome. Trithemius</hi> in his abridgement of Annals, thus: Childeric, <hi>as one vnfit for gouernement, was turned out of his Kingdome, with common conſent of the Eſtates and Peeres of the Realme, ſo aduiſed by Zacharie Pope of Rome. Godfridus</hi> of <hi>Viterbe</hi> in the 17. part of his Chronicle, and <hi>Guauguin</hi> in the life of <hi>Pepin,</hi> affirme the ſame. And was it not an eaſie matter to worke <hi>Pepin</hi> by counſell to lay hold on the Kingdome, when he could not be hindered from faſtening on the Crowne, and had already ſeizd it in effect, howſoeuer he had not yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the name of King? Moreouer, the rudeneſſe of that Nation, then wanting knowledge and Schooles either of diuinitie, or of Academi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſciences, was a kind of ſpurre to make them runne for counſell ouer the mountaines: which neuertheleſſe in a cauſe of ſuch nature, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not as neceſſary, but onely as decent and for faſhion ſake. The Popealſo for his part was well appaied, by this meanes to draw <hi>Pepin</hi> vnto his part; as one that ſtood in ſome neede of his aide againſt the Lombards; and the more, becauſe his Lord the Emperour of Conſtantinople was then brought ſo low, that hee was not able to ſend him ſufficient aide, for the defence of his territories againſt his enemies. But had <hi>Zacharie</hi> (to deale plainely) not ſtood vpon the reſpect of his owne commodity, more then vpon the regard of Gods feare; he would neuer haue giuen counſell vnto the ſeruant, vnder the pretended colour of his Maſters dull ſpirit, ſo to turne rebell againſt his Maſter. The Lawes prouide Gardians, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, for ſuch as are not well in their wits; they neuer depriue and ſpoile them of their eſtate: they puniſh crimes, but not diſeaſes and infirmities by nature. Yea, in France it is a very auncient cuſtome, when the King is troubled in his wits to eſtabliſh a Regent, who for the time of the Kings diſability, may beare the burden of the Kingdomes affaires. So was the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:23110:224"/>practiſe of that State in the caſe of <hi>Charles</hi> 6. when hee fell into a phrenſie; whom the Pope notwithſtanding his moſt grieuous and ſharpe fits, neuer offered to degrade. And to be ſhort, what reaſon, what equity will beare the children to be puniſhed for the fathers debilitie? Yet ſuch puniſhment was laid vpon <hi>Childerics</hi> whole race and houſe; who by this practiſe were all diſinherited of the Kingdome. But ſhall wee now take ſome view, of the L.
<note place="margin">Pag. 25.</note> Cardinals excuſe for this exemplarie fact? The cauſe of <hi>Childerics</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, (as the L. Cardinall ſaith) did neerely concerne and touch Religion: For <hi>Childerics</hi> imbecillity brought all France into danger, to ſuffer a moſt wofull ſhipwracke of Chriſtian religion, vpon the barbarous and hoſtile inuaſion of the Saracens. Admit now this reaſon had beene of iuſt weight and value, yet conſideration ſhould haue beene taken, whether ſome one or other of that Royall ſtemme, and of the Kings owne ſucceſſors neereſt of blood, was not of better capacity to rule and mannage that mighty State. The feare of vncertaine and accidentall miſchiefe, ſhould not haue driuen them to flie vnto the certaine miſchiefe of actuall and effectuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. They ſhould rather haue ſet before their eies the example of <hi>Charles Martel,</hi> this <hi>Pepins</hi> father; who in a farre more eminent danger, when the Saracens had already maſtered, and ſubdued a great part of France, valiantly encountred, and withall defeated the Saracens; ruled the Kingdome vnder the title of <hi>Steward</hi> of the Kings houſe, the principall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of the Crowne; without affecting or aſpiring to the Throne for all that great ſtep of aduantage, eſpecially when the Saracens were quite bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and no longer dreadfull to the French Nation.</p>
                  <p>In our owne Scotland, the ſway of the Kingdome was in the hand of <hi>Walles,</hi> during the time of <hi>Bruſe</hi> his impriſonment in England, who then was lawfull heire to the Crowne. This <hi>Walles</hi> or <hi>Vallas</hi> had the whole power of the Kingdome at his becke and command. His Edicts and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances to this day ſtand in full force. By the deadly hatred of <hi>Bruſe</hi> his mortall enemie, it may be coniectured, that he might haue bene prouoked and inflamed with deſiré to truſſe the Kingdome in his tallants. And notwithſtanding all theſe incitements, he neuer aſſumed or vſurped other title to himſelfe, then of Gouernour or Adminiſtratour of the Kingdome. The reaſon: Hee had not beene brought vp in this new doctrine and late diſcipline, whereby the Church is endowed with power to giue and to take away Crownes. But now (as the L. Cardinall would beare the world in hand) the ſtate of Kings is brought to a very dead lift. The Pope for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth muſt ſend his Phyſicians, to know by way of inſpection or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe of Art, whether the Kings braine be cract or ſound: and in caſe there be found any debilitie of wit and reaſon in the King, then the Pope muſt remooue and tranſlate the Crowne, from the weaker braine to a ſtronger: and for the acting of the ſtratageme, the name of Religion muſt be pretended. Ho, theſe Heretikes begin to crawle in the Kingdome: or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt bee taken they bee not ſuffered by their multitudes and ſwarmes,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:23110:224"/>like locuſts or caterpillers to peſter and poiſon the whole Realme. Or in a caſe of Matrimony, thus: Ho, marriage is a Sacrament: touch the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Matrimonie, and Relgion is wounded. By this deuice not onely the Kings vices, but likewiſe his naturall diſeaſes and infirmities are fetcht into the circle of Religion; and the L. Cardinall hath not done himſelfe right, in reſtraining the Popes power to depoſe Kings, vnto the caſes of Hereſie, Apoſtaſie, and perſecution of the Church.</p>
                  <p>In the next place followeth <hi>Leo</hi> III. who by ſetting the Imperial Crowne vpon the head of <hi>Charles,</hi> abſolued all the Subiects in the Weſt, of their obedience to the Greeke Emperours, if the L. of Perron might bee cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited in this Example. But indeed it is crowded among the reſt by a ſlie tricke, and cleane contrary to the naked trewth of all hiſtories: For it ſhall neuer be iuſtified by good hiſtorie, that ſo much as one ſingle perſon or man (I ſay not one Countrey, or one people) was then wrought or wonne by the Pope to change his copy and Lord, or from a ſubiect of the Greeke Emperours, to turne ſubiect vnto <hi>Charlemaine.</hi> Let me ſee but one Towne that <hi>Charlemaine</hi> recouered from the Greeke Emperours, by his right and title to his Empire in the Weſt: No, the Greeke Emperours had taken their farewell of the Weſt Empire long before: And therefore to nicke this vpon the tallie of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> his Acts, that he tooke away the Weſt from the Greeke Emperour, it is euen as if one ſhould ſay, that in this aage the Pope takes the Dukedome of <hi>Milan</hi> from the French Kings, or the citie of Rome from the Emperours of Germanie, becauſe their Predeceſſours in former aages had beene right Lords and gouernours of them both. It is one of the Popes ordinary and ſolemne practiſes to take away, much after the maner of his giuing: For as he giueth what he hath not in his right and power to giue, or beſtoweth vpon others what is already their owne; euen ſo he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away from Kings and Emperors the poſſeſſions which they haue not in preſent hold and poſſeſſion. After this maner he takes the Weſt from the Greeke Emperors, when they hold nothing in the Weſt, and lay no claime to any citie or towne of the Weſt Empire. And what ſhall wee call this way of depriuation, but ſpoiling a naked man of his garments, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a man already dead? Trew it is the Imperiall Crowne was then ſet on <hi>Charlemaines</hi> head by <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope: did <hi>Leo</hi> therefore giue him the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire? No more then a Biſhop that crownes a King, at his Royall and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne conſecration, doeth giue him the Kingdome: For ſhall the Pope himſelfe take the Popedome from the Biſhop of <hi>Oſtia</hi> as of his gift, becauſe the crowning of the Pope is an Office of long time peculiar to the <hi>Oſtian</hi> Biſhop? It was the cuſtome of Emperours, to be crowned Kings of Italy by the hands of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Milan:</hi> did he therefore giue the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Italy to the ſaid Emperours? And to returne vnto <hi>Charlemaine;</hi> If the Pope had conueyed the Empire to him by free and gracious donation, the Pope doubtleſſe in the ſolemnitie of his coronation, would neuer haue perfourmed vnto his ownecreature, an Emperour of his owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                  <p>When <hi>Philip</hi> 1. had repudiated his wife <hi>Bertha,</hi> daughter to the Earle of <hi>Holland;</hi> and in her place had alſo taken to wife <hi>Bertrade</hi> the wife of <hi>Fulco</hi> Earle of <hi>Aniou</hi> yet being aliue; hee was excommunicated, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome interdicted by <hi>Vrbanus</hi> then Pope, (though he was then bearded with an Antipope) as the L. Cardinal here giueth vs to vnderſtand. But his Lordſhip hath skipt ouer two principall points recorded in the hiſtorie. The firſt is, that <hi>Philip</hi> was not depoſed by the Pope: whereupon it is to be inferred, that in this paſſage there is nothing materiall to make for the Popes power againſt a Kings Throne and Scepter. The other point is, that by the cenſures of the Pope, the courſe of obedience due to the King before was not interrupted, nor the King diſauowed, refuſed, or diſclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: but on the contrary, that <hi>Iuo</hi> of <hi>Chartres</hi> taking Pope <hi>Vrbanus</hi> part, was puniſhed for his preſumption, diſpoyled of his eſtate, and kept in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: whereof he makes complaint himſelfe in his 19. and 20. Epiſtles. The L. Cardinall beſides, in my vnderſtanding for his Maſters honour, ſhould haue made no words of interdicting the whole Kingdome. For when the Pope, to giue a King chaſtiſement, doeth interdict his Kingdome, hee makes the people to beare the puniſhment of the Kings offence: For du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of interdiction, the Church doores through the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are kept continually ſhut and lockt vp: publike ſeruice is intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all places: bels euery where ſilent: Sacraments not adminiſtred to the people bodies of the dead ſo proſtituted and abandoned, that none dares burie the ſaid bodies in holy ground. More, it is beleeued, that a man dying vnder the curſe of the interdict (without ſome ſpeciall indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or priuiledge) is for euer damned and adiudged to eternall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as one that dyeth out of the communion of the Church. Put caſe then the interdict holdeth and continueth for many yeares together; alas, how many millions of poore ſoules are damned, and goe to hell for an others offence? For what can, or what may the faltleſſe and innocent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doe withall, if the King will repudiate his wife, and ſhe yet liuing, ioyne himſelfe in matrimonie to an other?</p>

                  <p>Moſt notable is the example of <hi>Philip the faire,</hi> and hits the bird in the right eye. In the yeere 1032. the Pope diſpatched the Archbiſhop of <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bona</hi> with <hi>mandates</hi> into France, commanding the King to releaſe the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Apamia</hi> then detained in priſon, for contumelious words tending to the Kings defamation, and ſpoken to the Kings owne head. In very deed this Pope had conceiued a ſecret grudge, and no light diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt King <hi>Philip</hi> before: namely, becauſe the King had taken vpon him the collation of Benefices, and other Eccleſiaſtical dignities. Vpon which occaſion the Pope ſent letters to the King of this tenour and ſtyle: <hi>Feare God, and keepe his Commandements: Wee would haue thee know, that in Spirituall and Temporall cauſes thou art ſubiect vnto our ſelfe: that collating of Benefices and Prebends, doeth not in any ſort appertaine to thy office and place: that, in caſe as kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Spiritualties, thou haue the custodie of Benefices and Prebends in thy hand when they become voyd, thou ſhalt by ſequestration reſerue the fruits of the ſame, to the vſe and benefit of the next Incumbents and ſucceſſors: and in caſe thou hast heretofore collated any, we ordaine the ſaid collations to be meerely void: and ſo farre as herein thou hast proceeded to the fact, we reuoke the ſaid collations. We hold them for hereticks whoſoeuer are not of this beliefe.</hi> A Legate comes to Paris, and brings theſe brauing letters: By ſome of the Kings faithfull ſeruants they are violently ſnatched and pulled out of the Legates hands: by the Earle of Artois they are caſt into the fire. The good King anſweres the Pope, and payes him in as good coyne as he had ſent. <hi>Philip by the grace of God King of the French, to</hi> Boniface <hi>calling and bearing himſelfe the Soueraigne Biſhop, little greeting or none at all. May thy exceeding ſottiſhneſſe vnderstand, that in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall cauſes we are not ſubiect vnto any mortall and earthly creature: that collating of Benefices and Prebends, by Regall right appertaineth to our office and place: that appropriating their fruits when they become void, belongeth to our ſelfe alone during their vacancie: that all collations by vs heretofore made, or to bee made hereafter, ſhall ſtand in force: that in the validitie and vertue of the ſaid collations, wee will euer couragiouſly defend and maintaine, all Incumbents and poſſeſſors of Benefices and Prebends ſo by vs collated. We hold them all for ſots and ſenſeleſſe, whoſoeuer are not of this beliefe.</hi> The Pope incenſed herewith, excommunicates the King: but no man dares publiſh that cenſure, or become bearer thereof.
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:23110:228"/>The King notwithſtanding the ſaid proceedings of the Pope, aſſembles his Prelates, Barons, and Knights at Paris: askes the whole aſſembly, of whom they hold their Fees, with al other the Temporalties of the Church. They make anſwere with one voice, that in the ſaid matters they diſclaime the Pope, and know none other Lord beſide his Maieſtie. Meane while the Pope worketh with Germanie and the Low Countreis, to ſtirre them vp againſt France. But <hi>Philip</hi> ſendeth <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Nogaret</hi> into Italy. <hi>William</hi> by the direction and aide of <hi>Sciarra Columnenſis,</hi> takes the Pope at <hi>Anagnia,</hi> mounts him vpon a leane ill-fauoured iade, caries him priſoner to Rome; where ouercome with choller, anguiſh, and great indignation, he takes his laſt leaue of the Popedome and his life. All this notwithſtanding, the King preſently after, from the ſucceſſours of <hi>Boniface</hi> receiues very ample and gratious Bulls, in which the memorie of all the former paſſages and actions is vtterly aboliſhed.
<note place="margin">Extrauag.

In that aage the French Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie caried other maner of ſpirits, then the moderne and preſent Nobilitie doe: I meane thoſe by whom the L. Cardinal was applauded and aſſiſted in his Oration. Yea, in thoſe former times the Prelates of the Realme ſtood better affected towards their King, then the L. Cardinal himſelfe now ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: who could finde none other way to dally with, and to ſhift off this pregnant example, but by plaine gloſing, that hereſie and Apoſtaſie was no ground of that queſtion, or ſubiect of that controuerſie. Wherein hee not onely condemnes the Pope, as one that proceeded againſt <hi>Philip</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a iuſt cauſe &amp; good ground; but likewiſe giues the Pope the Lie, who in his goodly letters but a little aboue recited, hath enrowled <hi>Philip</hi> in the liſt of heretiques. Hee ſaith moreouer, that indeed the knot of the queſtion was touching the Popes pretence, in challenging to himſelfe the temporall Soueraigntie of France, that is to ſay, in qualifying himſelfe King of France: But indeed and indeed no ſuch matter to be found. His whole pretence was the collating of Benefices, and to pearch aboue the King, to crow ouer his Crowne in Temporall cauſes. At which pretence his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe yet aimeth, ſtill attributing and challenging to himſelfe plenarie power to depoſe the King. Now if the L. Cardinal ſhall yet proceed to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, that <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth was taken by the French for an vſurper, and no lawfull Pope, but for one that crept into the Papacie by fraud and ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie; he muſt be pleaſed to ſet downe poſitiuely who was Pope, ſeeing that <hi>Boniface</hi> then ſate not in the Papall chaire. To conclude, If hee that creepeth and ſtealeth into the Papacie by ſymonie, by canuaſes or labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſuffrages vnder hand, or by bribery, be not lawfull Pope; I dare be bold to profeſſe, there will hardly be found two lawfull Popes in the three laſt aages.

                     <hi>Iohn d'Albret</hi> King of Nauarre, whoſe Realme was giuen by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Pope to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of Arragon, was alſo wrapped and entangled with ſtrict bands of depoſition. Now if the French had bene touched with no better feeling of affection to their King, then the ſubiects of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre were to the Nauarrois; doubtleſſe France had ſought a new Lord, by vertue of the Popes (as the L. Cardinall himſelfe doeth acknowledge and confeſſe) vniuſt ſentence. But behold, to make the ſaid ſentence againſt <hi>Iohn d'Albret</hi> ſeeme the leſſe contrary to equitie, the L. Cardinall pretends, the Popes donation was not indeed the principall cauſe,
<note place="margin">Pag. 31.</note> howſoeuer <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> himſelfe made it his pretence. But his Lo. giues this for the principall cauſe: that <hi>Iohn d'Albret</hi> had quitted his alliance made with condition; that
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:23110:229"/>in caſe the Kings of Nauarre ſhould infringe the ſaid alliance, and breake the league, then the kingdome of Nauarre ſhould returne to the Crowne of Arragon. This condition, betweene Kings neuer made, and without all ſhew of probabilitie, ſerueth to none other purpoſe from the Cardinals mouth, but onely to inſinuate and worke a perſwaſion in his King, that he hath no right nor lawfull pretenſion to the Crowne of Nauarre: and whatſoeuer hee now holdeth in the ſaid kingdome of Nauarre, is none of his owne, but by vſurpation and vnlawfull poſſeſſion. Thus his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip French-borne, makes himſelfe an Aduocate for the Spaniſh King, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne King, and King of the French: who ſhalbe faine, as hee ought (if this Aduocats plea may take place) to draw his title and ſtyle of King of Nauarre out of his Royall titles, and to acknowledge that all the great endeuours of his predeceſſors to recouer the ſaid Kingdome, were diſhonourable and vniuſt. Is it poſſible, that in the very heart and head Citie of France, a ſpirit and tongue ſo licentious can be brooked? What, ſhall ſo great blaſphemie (as it were) of the Kings freehold, bee powred foorth in ſo honourable an aſſembly, without puniſhment or fine? What, without any contradiction for the Kings right, and on the Kings behalfe? I may perhaps confeſſe the indignitie might bee the better borne, and the pretence alledged might paſſe for a poore excuſe, if it ſerued his purpoſe neuer ſo little. For how doeth all this touch or come neere the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? in which the Popes vſurpation in the depoſing of Kings, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the French in reſiſting this tyrannicall practiſe, is the proper iſſue of the cauſe: both which points are neuer a whit more of the leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and importance, howſoeuer <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in his owne iuſtification ſtood vpon the foreſaid pretence. Thus much is confeſſed, and wee aske no more: Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> tooke the Kingdome from the one, and gaue it vnto the other: the French thereupon reſiſted the Pope, and declared him to be fallen from the Papacie.</p>
                  <p>This noble ſpirit and courage of the French, in maintayning the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and honour of their Kings Crownes, bred thoſe ancient cuſtomes, which in the ſequence of many aages haue bene obſerued and kept in vſe. This for one: That no Legate of the Pope,

                     </note> nor any of his reſcripts nor <hi>mandates,</hi> are admitted and receiued in France, <hi>without licence from the King:</hi> and vnleſſe the Legate impart his faculties to the Kings Atturney Generall, to be peruſed and verified in Court of Parliament: where they are to be tyed by certaine modifications and reſtrictions, vnto ſuch points as are not derogatorie from the Kings right, from the liberties of the Church, and from the ordinances of the Kingdome. When Cardinal <hi>Balua,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bochellus.</note> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this ancient forme, entred France in the yeere 1484. and there without leaue of the King did execute the office, &amp; ſpeed certaine Acts of the Popes Legate; the Court vpon motion made by the Kings Atturney Generall, decreed a Commiſſion, to be informed againſt him by two Councellors of the ſaid Court, and inhibited his further proceeding to vſe any facultie or
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:23110:230"/>power of the Popes Legate, vpon paine of beeing proclaimed rebell.</p>
                  <p>In the yeere 1561. <hi>Iohannes Tanquerellus</hi> Batchelour in Diuinitie, by order of the Court was condemned to make open confeſſion, that hee had <hi>indiſcreetly and raſhly without conſideration</hi> defended this propoſition,

                  <p>In the heate of the laſt warres, raiſed by that holy-prophane League, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitory Bulls were ſent by Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> 14. from <hi>Rome,</hi> Anno 1591.

The Court of Parliament being aſſembled at <hi>Tours</hi> the 5. of Auguſt, decreed the ſaid admonitorie Bulls to bee cancelled, torne in pieces, and caſt into a great fire by the hand of the publike executioner. The Arreſt it ſelfe or Decree is of this tenour: <hi>The Court duely pondering and approouing the concluding and vnanſwerable reaſons of the Kings Attourney Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, hath declared, and by theſe preſent doeth declare, the admonitorie Bulls giuen at</hi> Rome <hi>the</hi> 1. <hi>of March</hi> 1591. <hi>to be of no validitie, abuſiue, ſeditious, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, full of impietie and impostures, contrary to the holy decrees rights, franchiſes, and liberties of the French Church: doeth ordeine the Copies of the ſaid Bulls, ſealed with the ſeale of</hi> Marſilius Landrianus, <hi>and ſigned</hi> Septilius Lamprius, <hi>to bee rent in pieces by the publike executioner, and by him to be burnt in a great fire to be made for ſuch purpoſe, before the great gates of the common Hall or Palace, &amp;c.</hi> Then, euen then the L. of <hi>Perron</hi> was firme for the better part, and ſtood for his King againſt <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Pope, notwithſtanding the crime of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie pretended againſt <hi>Henrie</hi> his Lord.</p>
                  <p>All the former examples by vs alledged, are drawen out of the times after Schooles of Diuinitie were eſtabliſhed in <hi>France:</hi> For I thought good to bound my ſelfe within thoſe dooles and limits of time, which the L.

                     <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> was commanded by Pope <hi>Paſchal</hi> 2. to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute with fire and ſword the Clergie of <hi>Liege,</hi> who then adhered and ſtood to the cauſe of the Emperour <hi>Henrie</hi> 4. whom the Pope had igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniouſly depoſed. <hi>Robert</hi> by the Popes order and command, was to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the Clergie of <hi>Liege</hi> in like ſort as before hee had ſerued the Clergie of <hi>Cambray,</hi> who by the ſaid Earle had beene cruelly ſtript both of goods and life: The Pope promiſed the ſaid Earle and his army pardon of their ſinnes for the ſaid execution. The Clergie of <hi>Liege</hi> addreſſed anſwere to the Pope at large: They cried out vpon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and called her <hi>Babylon:</hi> Told the Pope home, that God had commanded to giue vnto <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is <hi>Caeſars:</hi> that euery ſoule muſt bee ſubiect vnto the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour powers: that no man is exempted out of this precept: and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery oath of alleagiance is to be kept inuiolable; yea, that hereof they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are not ignorant, in as much as they by a new Schiſme, and new tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, making a ſeparation and rent of the Prieſthood from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, doe promiſe to abſolue of periurie, ſuch as haue perfidiouſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworne themſelues againſt their King. And whereas by way of deſpight and in opprobrious maner, they were excommunicated by the Pope, they gaue his Holineſſe to vnderſtand, that <hi>Dauids heart had vttered a good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but</hi> Paſchals <hi>heart had ſpewed vp ſordid and railing words, like old bawdes and ſpinſters or websters of linnen, when they ſcold and brawle one with another.</hi> Finally, they reiected his Papal excommunication, as a ſentence giuen without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. This was the voyce and free ſpeach of that Clergie, in the life time of their noble Emperour: But after hee was thruſt out of the Empire by the rebellion of his owne ſonne, inſtigated and ſtirred vp thereunto by the Popes perſwaſion and practiſe, and was brought vnto a miſerable death; it is no matter of wonder, that for the ſafegard of their life, the ſaid Clergie were driuen to ſue vnto the Pope for their pardon.

But I tell you the gloſſe is an Aurelian gloſse, which marres the text.</hi> Amongſt other arguments, <hi>Maior</hi> brings this for one: <hi>This opinion ministreth matter vnto Popes, to take away an others Empire by force and violence: which the Pope ſhall neuer bring to paſſe, as we reade of</hi> Boniface 8. <hi>against</hi> Philip <hi>the Faire: Saith beſides, That from hence proceede warres, in time of which many outragious miſchiefes are done, and that</hi> Gerſon <hi>calls them egregious flatterers by whom ſuch opinion is maintained.</hi> In the ſame place <hi>Maior</hi> denies that <hi>Childeric</hi> was depoſed by Pope <hi>Zacharie: The word, Hee depoſed, ſaith</hi> Maior, <hi>is not ſo to bee vnderſtood, as it is taken at the firſt bluſh or fight; but hee depoſed, is thus expounded in the gloſſe, Hee gaue his conſent vnto thoſe by whom he was depoſed.</hi>

                     <hi>Were it graunted that Chriſt was armed with Temporall power, yet he committed no ſuch power to Peter.</hi> A little after: <hi>The power of Kings is the higheſt power vpon earth: in Temporall cauſes it hath no ſuperiour power aboue it ſelfe, no more then the Pope hath in ſpirituall matters.</hi> This author ſaith indeede, the Pope hath power to excommunicate the King; but he ſpeaketh not of any power in the Pope to put downe the King from his regall dignity and authority: He onely ſaith, When a Prince is once excommunicated, hee may accidentally or by occaſion be depoſed: becauſe his precedent excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, incites the people to diſarme him of all ſecular dignity and power. The ſame Iohn on the other ſide holdeth opinion; that <hi>in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour there is inueſted a power to depoſe the Pope, in caſe the Pope ſhall abuſe his power.</hi>

A notable piece of ſlie and cunning conueiance: For what hereſie may not be fathered and faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> or S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> if they ſhould be deemed to approoue all the paſſages which they alledge out of other authors? And that is the reaſon wherefore the L. Cardinall doeth not alledge his teſtimonies whole and perfect, as they are couched in their proper texts, but clipt and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taild. Thus he dealeth euen in the firſt paſſage or teſtimonie of <hi>Almainus;</hi> he brings it in mangled and pared: he hides and conceales the words added by <hi>Almainus,</hi> to contradict and croſſe the words going before: For <hi>Almainus</hi> makes this addition and ſupply; <hi>Howſoeuer ſome other Doctors doe ſtand for the negatiue, and teach the Pope hath power onely to declare that Kings and Princes are to be depoſed.</hi> And ſo much appeareth by this reaſon; becauſe this am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Soueraigne power of the Pope, might giue him occaſion to be puft vp with great pride, and the ſame fulneſſe of power might prooue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely hurtfull to the ſubiects, &amp;c.</p>

On the other ſide, if the Pope hold any Temporall poſſeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hee is bound to ſweare allegiance vnto the Emperour, and to pay him tribute.</hi> The ſaid <hi>Occam</hi> alledged by <hi>Almainus</hi> doeth further auerre, that <hi>Iustinian</hi> was acknowledged by the Pope for his ſuperiour in Temporall cauſes: for as much as diuers Lawes which the Pope is bound to keepe and obſerue, were enacted by <hi>Iuſtinian;</hi> as by name the Law of preſcription for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres: which Law ſtandeth yet in force againſt the Biſhop of Rome.

Art. 10. in the body of the Article; In which place (let it bee narrowly examined) <hi>Thomas</hi> will eaſily bee found to ſpeake, not of the ſubiection of beleeuing Subiects vnder Infidel Kings, as the Lord Cardinall pretendeth, but of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing ſeruants that liue vnder Maſters, whether Iewes or Infidels: As when a Iew keepeth ſeruants which profeſſe <hi>Ieſus Christ;</hi> or as when ſome of the faithfull kept in <hi>Caeſars</hi> houſe; who are not conſidered by <hi>Thomas</hi> as they were ſubiects of the Empire, but as they were ſeruants of the family. The other place is taken out of Queſt. 11. and 2. Art. in the body of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle: where no ſuch matter as the L. Cardinal alledgeth can be found.</p>
                  <p>With like fidelitie he taketh <hi>Gerſon</hi> in hand:
<note place="margin">Pag. 44.</note> who indeed in his booke of Eccleſiaſticall power, and 12. Conſider. doeth affirme, <hi>When the abuſe of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power redoundeth to manifest impugning of the faith, and blaspheming of the Creator, then ſhall it not bee amiſſe to haue recourſe vnto the laſt branch of this</hi> 12. <hi>Conſider. where, in ſuch caſe as aforeſaid, a certaine regitiue, directiue, regulatiue, and ordinatiue authoritie is committed to the Eccleſiasticall power.</hi> His very words: which make no mention at all of depoſing, or of any compulſiue power ouer Soueraigne Princes: For that forme of rule and gouernment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſpeaketh, is exerciſed by Eccleſiaſticall cenſures and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; not by loſſe of goods, of Kingdomes, or of Empires. This place then is wreſted by the L. Cardinall to a contrary ſenſe. Neither ſhould his
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:23110:232"/>Lordſhip haue omitted, that <hi>Gerſon,</hi> in the queſtion of Kings ſubiection in Temporall matters, or of the dependance of their Crownes vpon the Popes power, excepteth alwayes the King of France: witneſſe that which <hi>Gerſon</hi> a little before the place alleadged by the Cardinall, hath plainely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: <hi>Now ſince</hi> Peters <hi>time, ſaith</hi> Gerſon, <hi>all Imperiall, Regall, and Secular power is not immediatly to draw vertue and ſtrength from the Soueraigne Biſhop: as in this maner the moſt Chriſtian King of France hath no Superiour, nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth any ſuch vpon the face of the earth.</hi> Now here need no great ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of wit for the ſearching out of this deepe myſterie; that if the Pope hath power to giue or take away Crownes for any cauſe or any preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded occaſion whatſoeuer, the Crowne of France muſt needs depend vpon the Pope.</p>
                  <p>But for as much as we are now hit in with <hi>Gerſon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 108.109.119. where the Card. takes Char. 7. for Charl. 6.</note> we will examine the L. Cardinals allegations towards the end of his Oration, taken out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> famous Oration made before <hi>Charles</hi> the 6. for the Vniuerſitie of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris: where he brings in <hi>Gerſon</hi> to affirme, <hi>That killing a Tyrant is a ſacrifice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God.</hi> But <hi>Gerſon</hi> (let it be diligently noted) there ſpeaketh not in his owne perſon: he there brings in ſedition ſpeaking the words: Of which wordes vttered by ſedition, and other like ſpeeches, you ſhall now heare what iudgement <hi>Gerſon</hi> himſelfe hath giuen. <hi>When ſedition had ſpoken with ſuch a furious voyce, I turned away my face as if I had bene ſmitten with death, to ſhew that I was not able to endure her madneſſe any longer.</hi> And indeed when diſſimulation on the one ſide, and ſedition on the other, had ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the deuiſes of two contrary extremes, hee brings foorth <hi>Diſcretion</hi> as a Iudge, keeping the meane betweene both extremes, and vttering thoſe words which the L. Cardinall alledgeth againſt himſelfe. <hi>If the head,</hi> (<hi>ſaith</hi> Gerſon) <hi>or ſome other member of the ciuill body, ſhould grow to ſo desperate a paſſe, that it would gulpe and ſwallow downe the deadly poyſon of tyrannie; euery member in his place, with all power poſsible for him to raiſe by expedient meanes, and ſuch as might preuent a greater inconuenience, ſhould ſet himſelfe againſt ſo madde a purpoſe, and ſo deadly practiſe: For if the head be grieued with ſome light paine, it is not fit for the hand to ſmite the head: no that were but a fooliſh and a mad part: Nor is the hand forthwith to chop off or ſeparate the head from the body, but rather to cure the head with good ſpeach and other meanes, like a skilfull and wiſe Phyſitian: Yea nothing would be more cruel or more voyd of reaſon, then to ſeeke to ſtop the ſtrong and violent ſtreame of tyrannie by ſedition.</hi> Theſe words, me thinke, doe make very ſtrongly and expreſly againſt butchering euen of Tyrannical Kings. And whereas a little after the ſaid paſſage, he teacheth to expell Tyrannie, he hath not a word of expelling the Tyrant, but onely of breaking and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off the yoke of Tyrannie. Yet for all that, he would not haue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for the repreſſing of Tyrannie, to be fetcht from the Pope, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth to degrade Kings, but from <hi>Philoſophers, Lawyers, Diuines, and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages of good conuerſation.</hi> It appeareth now by all that hath bin ſaid before, that whereas <hi>Gerſon</hi> in the 7. Conſiderat. <hi>againſt Flatterers,</hi> doeth affirme:
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:23110:233"/>
                     <hi>Whenſoeuer the Prince doeth manifestly purſue and proſecute his naturall ſubiects, and ſhew himſelfe obstinately bent with notorious iniuſtice, to vexe them of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and with full conſent, ſo farre as to the fact; then this rule and law of Nature doeth take place, It is lawfull to reſist and repell force by force; and the ſentence of</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, <hi>There is no ſacrifice more acceptable to God, then a tyrant offered in ſacrifice;</hi> the words, <hi>doeth take place,</hi> are ſo to be vnderſtood, as he ſpeaketh in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſage, to wit, with or amongſt ſeditious perſons. Or elſe the words, <hi>doeth take place,</hi> doe onely ſignifie, <hi>is put in practiſe.</hi> And ſo <hi>Gerſon</hi> there ſpeaketh not as out of his owne iudgement.</p>
                  <p>His Lordſhip alſo ſhould not haue balked and left out <hi>Sigebertus,</hi> who with more reaſon might haue paſſed for French, then <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Occam,</hi> whom hee putteth vpon vs for French. <hi>Sigebertus</hi> in his Chronicle vpon the yeere 1088. ſpeaking of the Emperours depoſing by the Pope, hath words of this tenour: <hi>This Hereſie was not crept out of the ſhell in thoſe dayes, that his Prieſts, who hath ſaid to the King</hi> Apoſtata, <hi>and maketh an hypocrite to rule for the ſinnes of the people, ſhould teach the people they owe no ſubiection vnto wicked Kings, nor any alleagiance, notwithstanding they haue taken the oath of alleagiance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now after the L. Cardinal hath courſed in this maner through the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the laſt aages (which in caſe they all made for his purpoſe, doe lacke the weight of authority) in ſtead of ſearching the will of God in the ſacred Oracles of his word and ſtanding vpon examples of the ancient Church; at laſt, leauing the troupe of his owne allegations, he betakes himſelfe to the ſharpening and rebating of the points of his aduerſaries weapons.</p>
                  <p>For the purpoſe, he brings in his aduerſaries, the champions of Kings Crownes, &amp; makes them to ſpeake out of his own mouth (for his Lordſhip ſaith it will be obiected) after this maner:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 52. <hi>&amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentibus.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>It may come to paſse, that Popes either</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>caried with paſsion, or miſled by ſiniſter information, may without iuſt cauſe fasten vpon Kings the imputation of hereſie or apostaſie.</hi> Then for King-depoſers he frames this anſwere: <hi>That by hereſie they vnderſtand notorious hereſie, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly condemned by ſentence of the Church. Moreouer, in caſe the Pope hath erred in the fact, it is the Clergies part adhering to their King, to make remonſtrances vnto the Pope, and to require the cauſe may be referred to the iudgement of a full Councel, the French Church then and there being preſent.</hi>
                     </q> Now in this anſwere, the L. Cardinall is of another mind then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his brother Cardinall:
<note place="margin">Aduerſ. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claium.</note> For hee goes thus farre, That a Prince condemned by vniuſt ſentence of the Pope, ought neuertheleſſe to quit his Kingdome, and that his Paſtors vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt ſentence ſhall not redound to his detriment; prouided that hee giue way to the ſaid ſentence, and ſhew himſelfe not refractarie, but ſtay the time in patience, vntil the holy Father ſhall renounce his error, and reuoke his foreſaid vniuſt ſentence. In which caſe theſe two material points are to be preſuppoſed: The one, That he who now hath ſeized the kingdome of the Prince diſplaced, wil forthwith (if the Pope ſhall ſollicit and intercede) returne the Kingdome to the hand of the late poſſeſſor: The other, That in
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:23110:233"/>the <hi>interim</hi> the Prince vniuſtly depoſed, ſhall not need to feare the bloody murderers mercileſſe blade and weapon. But on the other ſide, the Popes power of ſo large a ſize, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath ſhaped, is no whit pleaſing to the L. Cardinals eye. For in caſe the King ſhould be vniuſtly depoſed by the Pope <hi>not well informed,</hi> he is not of the minde the Kingdome ſhould ſtoupe to the Popes beheſts, but will rather haue the Kingdome to deale by remonſtrance, and to referre the cauſe vnto the Council: Wherein he makes the Council to be of more abſolute and ſupreme authority then the Pope; a ſtraine to which the holy father will neuer lend his eare. And yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the Council required in this caſe muſt be vniuerſall; wherein the French, for ſo much as they ſtand firme for the King and his cauſe, can be no Iudges: and in that regard the L. Cardinal requireth onely the preſence of the French Church. Who ſeeth not here into what pickle the French cauſe is brought by this meanes? The Biſhops of <hi>Italie</hi> forſooth, of <hi>Spaine,</hi> of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> of <hi>Germanie,</hi> the ſubiects of Soueraignes many times at profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or priuie enmitie with <hi>France,</hi> ſhall haue the cauſe compremitted and referred to their iudgement, whether the Kindome of <hi>France</hi> ſhall driue out her Kings, and ſhall kindle the flames of ſeditious troubles, in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart and bowels of the Realme. But is it not poſſible, that a King may lacke the loue of his owne ſubiects, and they taking the vantage of that occaſion, may put him to his trumps in his owne Kingdome? Is it not poſſible, that calumniations whereby a credulous Pope hath beene ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, may in like maner deceiue ſome part of a credulous people? Is it not poſſible that one part of the people may cleaue to the Popes Faction, another may hold and ſtand out for the Kings rightfull cauſe, and ciuill warres may be kindled by the ſplene of theſe two ſides? Is it not poſſible, that his Holineſſe will not reſt in the remonſtrances of the French, and will no further purſue his cauſe? And whereas now a dayes a Generall Councill cannot be held, except it be called and aſſembled by the Popes authority; is it credible, the Pope will take order for the conuocation of a Council, by whom he ſhall be iudged? And how can the Pope be Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in a Councill, where himſelfe is the party impleaded? and to whom the ſifting of his owne ſentence is referred, as it were to Committies, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether it was denounced according to Law, or againſt Iuſtice? But in the meane time, whileſt all theſe remonſtrances and addreſſes of the Council are on foot; behold, the Royall Maieſtie of the King hangeth as it were by looſe gimmals, and muſt ſtay the iudgement of the Council to whom it is referred. Well: what if the Councill ſhould happe to be two or three yeeres in aſſembling, and to continue or hold eighteene yeeres, like the Councill of <hi>Trent;</hi> ſhould not poore <hi>France,</hi> I beſeech you, be reduced to a very bad plight? ſhould ſhe not be in a very wiſe and warme taking? To be ſhort; His Lordſhips whole ſpeach for the vntying of this knot, not onely ſurmounteth poſſibilitie, but is ſtuft with ridiculous toyes. This I make manifeſt by his addition in the ſame paſſage. <hi>If the Pope deceiued

Who doth not knowe, that a King, ſo long as he is vpheld and maintained in his Kingdome by his people, cannot actually and effectually be depoſed from his Throne? Hee that ſpeaketh ſuch language and phraſe, in effect ſaith, and ſaith no more then this: A King is neuer depriued of his Crowne, ſo long as he can keepe his Crowne on his head: a King is neuer turned and ſtript naked, ſo long as he can keepe his cloathes on his backe: a King is neuer depoſed, ſo long as he can make the ſtronger partie and ſide againſt his enemies: in briefe, a King is King, and ſhall ſtill remaine King, ſo long as he can hold the poſſeſſion of his Kingdome, and ſitfaſt in his Chaire of Eſtate. Howbeit, let vs here by the way, take notice of theſe words vttered by his Lordſhip: <hi>That for the depoſing of a King, the conſent of the people must be obtained:</hi> For by theſe words the people are exalted aboue the King, and are made the Iudges of the Kings depoſing.</p>

And how can he, that may be infected with damnable hereſie (when himſelfe is not alwayes free from hereſie) be a iudge of hereſie in a King? In this queſtion ſome are of opinion, that as a man, the Pope may fall into error, but not as Pope. Very good: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand then vpon the matter, wherefore the Pope doth not inſtruct and reforme the man? or wherefore the man doth not require the Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions? But whether a King be depoſed by that man the Pope, or by that Pope the man, is it not all one? is he not depoſed? Others affirme, the Pope may erre in a queſtion of the fact, but not in a queſtion of the right. An egregious gullery and impoſture: For if he may be ignorant whether Ieſus Chriſt died for our ſinnes, doubtles he may alſo be to ſeeke, whether we ſhould repoſe all our truſt and aſſured confidence in the death of Chriſt. Conſider with me the Prophets of olde: They were all inſpired and taught of God, to admoniſh and reprooue the Kings of Iudah and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael: they neither erred in matter of fact, nor in point of right: they were as farre from being blinded and fetcht ouer by deceitfull calumniations, as from beeing ſeduced by the painted ſhew of corrupt and falſe doctrine: As
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:23110:234"/>they neuer trode awry in matter of faith; ſo they neuer whetted the edge of their tongue or ſtyle againſt the faultleſſe. Had it not beene a trimme deuice in their times, to ſay, that as <hi>Eſay</hi> and as <hi>Daniel</hi> they might haue ſunke into hereſie, but not as Prophets? For doubtleſſe in this caſe, that <hi>Eſay</hi> would haue taken counſell of the Prophet which was himſelfe. To be ſhort; If Kings are onely ſo long to be taken for Kings, vntill they ſhall be declared heretikes, and ſhall be depoſed by the Pope; they continually ſtand in extreame danger, to vndergoe a very heauy and vniuſt ſentence. Their ſafeſt way were to know nothing, and to beleeue by proxie; leaſt, if they ſhould happen to talke of God, or to thinke of religion, they ſhould be drawne for heretikes into the Popes Inquiſition.</p>
                  <p>All the examples hitherto produced by the Lord Cardinall on a rowe, are of a latter date, they lacke weight, are drawne from the time of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and make the Popes themſelues witneſſes in their owne cauſe: They deſcant not vpon the point of depoſition, but onely ſtrike out and ſound the notes of excommunication and interdiction, which make nothing at all to the muſicke of the queſtion. And therefore hee telleth vs (in kindneſſe as I take it) more oftentimes then once or twice, that hee ſpeaketh onely of the fact; as one that doeth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge himſelfe to bee out of the right: Hee relates things done, but neuer what ſhould bee done: which, as the Iudicious know, is to teach nothing.</p>

In the whole, his Lordſhip toyles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in vaine, &amp; maketh ſuppoſitions of caſtles in the aire. For in preferring this Article, the third Eſtate haue born themſelues not as iudges or vmpires,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:23110:235"/>but altogether as petitioners: requeſting the ſaid Article might be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into the number of the Parliament bookes to bee preſented vnto the King and his Counſell, vnto whom in all humilitie they referred the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſaid Article; conceiuing all good hope the Clergie and Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie would be pleaſed to ioyne for the furtherance of their humble petition. They were not ſo ignorant of State-matters, or ſo vnmindfull of their owne places and charges, to beare themſelues in hand, that a petition put vp and preferred by the third Eſtate, can carry the force of a Law or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, ſo long as the other two Orders withſtand the ſame, and ſo long as the King himſelfe holds backe his Royall conſent. Beſides, the ſaid Article was not propounded as a point of Religious doctrine; but for euer after to remaine and continue a fundamentall Law of the Common-wealth and State it ſelfe, the due care whereof was put into their handes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their truſt. If the King had ratified the ſaid Article with Royall conſent, and had commanded the Clergie to put in execution the contents thereof; it had bene their duetie to ſee the Kings will and pleaſure fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as they are ſubiects bound to giue him aide in all things, which may any way ſerue to procure the ſafetie of his life, and the tranquilitie of his Kingdome: Which if the Clergie had performed to the vttermoſt of their power, they had not ſhewed obedience as vnderlings, vnto the third Eſtate, but vnto the King alone; by whom ſuch command had bene impoſed, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuggeſtion of his faithfull ſubiects, made the more watchfull by the negligence of the Clergie; whom they perceiue to be lincked with ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter bandes vnto the Pope, then they are vnto their King. Here then the Cardinall fights with meere ſhadowes, and mooues a doubt whereof his aduerſaries haue not ſo much as once thought in a dreame: But yet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his great dexteritie and nimbleneſſe of ſpirit, by this deuice he cunningly takes vpon him to giue the King a leſſon with more libertie; making ſemblance to direct his masked Oration to the Deputies of the people, when hee ſhooteth in effect, and pricketh at his King, the Princes alſo and Lords of his Counſell, whom the Cardinall compriſeth vnder the name of Laics; whoſe iudgment (it is not vnlikely) was apprehended much better by the Clergie, then the iudgement of the third Eſtate. Now theſe are the men whom he tearmes intruders into other mens charges, and ſuch as open a gate for I wot not how many legions of hereſies, to ruſh into the Church: For if it be proper to the Clergie and their Head, to iudge in this cauſe of the Right of Kings; then the King himſelfe, his Princes, and Nobilitie, are debarred and wiped of all iudgement in the ſame cauſe, no leſſe then the repreſentatiue body of the people.</p>
                  <p>Well then,
<note place="margin">Pag. 61.</note> the L.

<pb n="428" facs="tcp:23110:236"/>propound nothing in their Conuocations and Conſultations, but moſt of all in their Determinations, to vndermine the Emperours authoritie, to diſturbe the tranquilitie of the Common-wealth, and to croſſe the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of precedent Councils. Now to take the cognizance of ſuch matters out of the Kings hand or power; what is it but euen to transforme the King into a ſtanding Image, to wring and wreſt him out of all care of himſelfe and his Kingly Charge, yea to bring him downe to this baſeſt condition, to become onely an executioner, and (which I ſcorne to ſpeake) the vnhappy hangman of the Clergies will, without any further cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, not ſo much as of matters which moſt neerely touch himſelfe, and his Royall eſtate?</p>
                  <p>I grant it is for Diuinitie Scholes, to iudge how farre the power of the Keyes doth ſtretch: I grant againe, that Clerics both may, and ought alſo to diſplay the colours and enſignes of their cenſures againſt Princes, who violating their publike and ſolemne oath, doe raiſe and make open warre againſt <hi>Ieſus Christ:</hi> I grant yet againe, that in this caſe they need not admit Laics to be of their counſell, nor allow them any ſcope or libertie of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yet all this makes no barre to Clerics, for extending the power of their keyes, many times a whole degree further then they ought; and when they are pleaſed, to make vſe of their ſaid power, to depriue the people of their goods, or the Prince of his Crowne: all this doeth not hinder Prince or people from taking care for the preſeruation of their owne rights and eſtates, nor from requiring Clerics to ſhew their cards, and produce their Charts, and to make demonſtration by Scripture, that ſuch power as they aſſume and challenge, is giuen them from God. For to leaue the Pope ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Iudge in the ſame cauſe, wherein hee is a partie, and (which is the ſtrongeſt rampier and bulwarke, yea the moſt glorious and eminent point of his domination) to arme him with power to vnhorſe Kings out of their ſeates; what is it elſe but euen to draw them into a ſtate of deſpaire for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer winning the day, or preuailing in their honourable and rightful cauſe?</p>
                  <p>It is moreouer granted, if a King ſhall command any thing directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods word, and tending to the ſubuerting of the Church; that Clerics in this caſe ought not onely to diſpenſe with ſubiects for their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, but alſo expreſly to forbid their obedience: For it is alwayes better to obey God then man. Howbeit in all other matters, whereby the glory and maieſtie of God is not impeached or impaired, it is the duety of Clerics to plie the people with wholeſome exhortation to conſtant obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to auert by earneſt diſſwaſions the ſaid people from tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reuolt and ſeditious inſurrection. This practiſe vnder the Pagan Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, was held and followed by the ancient Chriſtians; by whoſe godly zeale and patience in bearing the yoke, the Church in times paſt grew and flouriſhed in her happy and plentifull increaſe, farre greater then Poperie ſhall euer purchaſe and attaine vnto by all her cunning deuices and ſleights: as namely by degrading of Kings, by interdicting of Kingdoms, by appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted

                  <p>The places of Scripture alleadged in order by the Cardinal,
<note place="margin">Pag 66.</note> in fauour of thoſe that ſtand for the Popes claime of power and authoritie to depoſe Kings, are cited with no more ſincerity then the former: <q>
                        <hi>They alledge</hi> (theſe are his words) <hi>that</hi> Samuel <hi>depoſed King</hi> Saul, <hi>or declared him to bee depoſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee had violated the Lawes of the Iewes Religion:</hi>
                     </q> His Lordſhip auouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth elſewere, that <hi>Saul</hi> was depoſed, becauſe he had ſought prophanely to vſurpe the holy Prieſthood. Both falſe and contrary to the tenour of trewth in the ſacred hiſtory: For <hi>Saul</hi> was neuer depoſed according to the ſenſe of the word (I meane, <hi>depoſe</hi>) in the preſent queſtion; to wit, as depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is taken for deſpoiling the King of his royall dignitie, and reducing the King to the condition of a priuate perſon: But <hi>Saul</hi> held the title of King, and continued in poſſeſſion of his Kingdome, euen to his dying day.
<note place="margin">1. Sam. 23.20. &amp; 24.15. &amp; 2. Sam. 2.5.</note> Yea, the Scripture ſtyles him King, euen to the periodicall and laſt day of his life, by the teſtimony of <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe, who both by Gods promiſe, and by precedent vnction, was then heire apparant as it were to the Crown, in a maner then ready to gird and adorne the temples of his head. For if <hi>Samuel,</hi> by Gods commandement, had then actually remooued <hi>Saul</hi> from his Throne, doubtleſſe the whole Church of Iſrael had committed a groſſe errour, in taking and honouring <hi>Saul</hi> for their King, after ſuch depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: doubtleſſe the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> himſelfe, making knowen the Lords Ordinance vnto the people, would haue enioyned them by ſtrict prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to call him no longer the King of Iſrael: Doubtleſſe, <hi>Dauid</hi> would neuer haue held his hand from the throat of <hi>Saul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 26.11</note> for this reſpect and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, becauſe he was the Lords Anointed. For if <hi>Saul</hi> had loſt his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authority, from that inſtant when <hi>Samuel</hi> gaue him knowledge of his reiection; then <hi>Dauid,</hi> leſt otherwiſe the Body of the Kingdome ſhould want a Royall Head, was to beginne his Reigne, and to beare the Royall ſcepter in the very ſame inſtant: which were to charge the holy Scriptures with vntrewth, in as much as the ſacred hiſtorie begins the computation of the yeeres of <hi>Dauids</hi> Reigne, from the day of <hi>Sauls</hi> death. Trew it is, that in the 1. Sam. cap. 15. <hi>Saul</hi> was denounced by Gods owne ſentence, a man reiected, and as it were excommunicated out of the Kingdome, that hee ſhould not rule and reigne any longer as King ouer Iſrael, neuertheleſſe, the ſaid ſentence was not put in execution, before the day when God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting vpon <hi>Saul</hi> an exemplarie iudgement, did ſtrike him with death. From whence it is manifeſt and cleare,
<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16.23.</note> that when <hi>Dauid</hi> was annointed King by <hi>Samuel,</hi> that action was onely a promiſe, and a teſtimony of the choice, which God had made of <hi>Dauid</hi> for ſucceſſion immediately after <hi>Saul;</hi> and not a preſent eſtabliſhment, inueſtment, or inſtallment of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> in the Kingdome. Wee reade the like in 1. King. cap. 19. where God commandeth <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet, to annoint <hi>Haſael</hi> King of <hi>Syria:</hi> For can any man bee ſo blinde and ignorant in the ſacred hiſtorie, to beleeue the Prophets of Iſrael eſtabliſhed, or ſacred the Kings of <hi>Syria?</hi> For this
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:23110:237"/>cauſe,
<note place="margin">2. Sam. 2.4.</note> when <hi>Dauid</hi> was actually eſtabliſhed in the Kingdome, hee was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed the ſecond time.</p>
                  <p>In the next place he brings in the Popes champions vſing theſe words; <hi>Rehoboam was depoſed by Ahiah the Prophet,
<note place="margin">1 King. 12.</note> from his Royall right ouer the tenne</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>Tribes of Iſrael, becauſe his father Salomon had played the Apostata, in falling from the Law of God.</hi>
                     </q> This I ſay alſo is more, then the trewth of the ſacred hiſtory doeth afoard: For <hi>Ahiah</hi> neuer ſpake to <hi>Rehoboam</hi> (for ought we reade,) nor brought vnto him any meſſage from the Lord; As for the paſſage quoted by the L. Cardinal out of 3. <hi>Reg.</hi> chap. 11. it hath not reference to the time of <hi>Rehoboams</hi> raigne, but rather indeed to Salomons time: nor doeth it carry the face of a iudicatorie ſentence for the Kings depoſing, but rather of a Propheticall prediction: For how could <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> before hee was made King, be depriued of the Kingdome? Laſt of all, but worſt of all; to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge this paſſage for an example of a iuſt ſentence in matter of depoſing a King, is to approoue the diſloyall treacherie of a ſeruant againſt his maſter, and the rebellion of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> branded in Scripture with a marke of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall infamie for his wickedneſſe and impietie.</p>

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:23110:237"/>againſt <hi>Antiochus,</hi> is no better worth: For in that example we finde no ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of depoſition, but onely an heartning and commotion of a people then grieuouſly afflicted and oppreſſed. He that makes himſelfe the ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader of conſpiracie againſt a King, doeth not foorthwith aſſume the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or take vp the office and charge of a Iudge, in forme of Law, and iuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically to depriue a King of his Regall rights, and Royall prerogatiues. <hi>Mattathias</hi> was chiefe of that conſpiracie, not in qualitie of Prieſt, but of cheiftaine, or leader in warre and a man the beſt qualified of all the people. Things acted by the ſuddaine violence of the baſe vulgar, muſt not ſtand for Lawes, nor yet for proofes and arguments of ordinarie power, ſuch as the Pope challengeth to himſelfe, and appropriateth to his triple-Crowne.</p>
                  <p>Theſe be our ſolide anſweres:
<note place="margin">Page 67.</note> we diſclaime the light armour which the L. Cardinall is pleaſed to furniſh vs withall, forſooth to recreate himſelfe, in rebating the points of ſuch weapons, as hee hath vouchſafed to put into our hands. Now it wil be worth our labour to beate by his thruſts, fetcht from the ordinary miſſion of the New Teſtament, from leproſie, ſtones, and locks of wooll: A leach no doubt of admirable skill, one that for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting the Crownes of Kings vnto the Pope, is able to extract arguments out of ſtones; yea, out of the leproſie, and the drie ſcab, onely forſooth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hereſie is a kind of leproſie, and an heretike hath ſome affinitie with aleper. But may not his <hi>Quoniam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Page 66.</note> bee as fitly applyed to any contagious and inueterate vice of the minde beſide hereſie? His warning-piece there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is diſcharged to purpoſe, whereby hee notifies that hee pretendeth to handle nothing with reſolution: For indeed vpon ſo weake arguments, a reſolution is but ill-fauouredly and weakely grounded.</p>
                  <p>His bulwarkes thus beaten downe,
<note place="margin">Page 69.</note> let vs now view the ſtrength of our owne. Firſt, he makes vs to fortifie on this maner: <q>
                        <hi>They that are for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue, doe alleadge the authoritie of</hi> S. Paul; <hi>Let euery ſoule bee ſubiect vnto the higher powers: For whoſoeuer reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God. And likewiſe that of</hi> S. Peter; <hi>Submit your ſelues, whether it be vnto the King, as vnto the ſuperiour, or vnto gouernours, &amp;c. Vpon theſe paſſages, and the like, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that obedience is due to Kings by the Law of God, and not dispenſable by any Spirituall or Temporall authoritie.</hi>
                     </q> Thus he brings vs in with our firſt wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. But here the very chiefe ſinew and ſtrength of our argument, hee doeth wittingly balke, and of purpoſe conceale: To wit; That all the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors of whom the ſaid holy Apoſtles haue made any mention in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Epiſtles, were profeſſed enemies to CHRIST, Pagans, Infidels, feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and bloody Tyrants: to whom notwithſtanding <hi>euery ſoule,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Biſhop of Rome for one, is commanded to ſubmit himſelfe, and to profeſſe ſubiection. Thus much <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> hath expreſly taught in his Hom. 23. vpon the Epiſtle to the Romanes; <hi>The Apoſtle giues this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement vnto all: euen to Priests alſo, and cloistered Monkes not onely to Secular: be thou an Apostle an Euangelist, a Prophet, &amp;c.</hi> Beſides, it is here worthy to be noted, that howſoeuer the Apoſtles rule is generall, and therefore bindeth
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:23110:238"/>all the faithfull in equall bands; yet is it particularly, directly and of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe addreſſed to the Church of Rome by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as by one who in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of an Apoſtle did foreſee, that rebellion againſt Princes was to riſe and ſpring from the citie of Rome. Now in caſe the Head of that Church by warrant of any priuiledge, contained in the moſt holy Regiſter of Gods holy word, is exempted from the binding power of this generall precept or rule; did it not become his Lordſhip to ſhew by the booke, that it is a booke caſe, and to lay it foorth before that honourable aſſembly, who no doubt expected and waited to heare when it might fall from his learned lips? But in ſtead of any ſuch authenticall and canonicall confirmation, he flieth to a ſleight ſhift, and with a cauill is bold to affirme the foundation, laid by thoſe of our ſide, doeth no way touch the knot of the controuerſie. Let vs heare him ſpeake: <q>
                        <hi>It is not in controuerſie, whether obedience be due to kings by Gods Law, ſo long as they are kings, or acknowledged for Kings, but our point controuerted, is whether by Gods Law it be required, that hee who hath bene once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſed and receiued for King by the body of Eſtates, can at any time be taken and reputed as no King, that is to ſay can doe no maner of acte whereby hee may looſe his right, and ſo ceaſe to be ſaluted King.</hi>
                     </q> This anſwere of the L. Cardinall is the rare deuiſe euaſion, and ſtarting hole of the <hi>Ieſuites:</hi> In whoſe eares of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and tender touch, King-killing ſoundeth very harſh; but forſooth to vn-king a King firſt, and then to giue him the ſtab, that is a point of iuſt and trew deſcant: For to kill a King, once vnking'd by depoſition, is not killing of a King: For the preſent, I haue one of that Ieſuiticall Order in priſon, who hath face enough to ſpeake this language of Aſhdod, and to maintaine this doctrine of the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> Colledges. The L. Cardinall harpes vpon the ſame ſtring; He can like ſubiection and obedience to the King, whileſt he ſitteth King: but his Holineſſe muſt haue all power, and giue order withall, to hoyſt him out of his Royall Seat. I therefore now anſwer, that in very deed the former paſſages of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould come no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing neere the queſtion, if the ſtate of the queſtion were ſuch as he brings it, made and forged in his owne ſhop. But certes the ſtate of the queſtion is not, whether a King may doe ſome acte, by reaſon whereof hee may fall from his right, or may not any longer be acknowledged for King: For all our contention is, concerning the Popes power to vn-authorize Princes; wheras in the queſtion framed and fitted by the L. Cardinal, not a word of the Pope. For were it granted and agreed on both ſides, that a King by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction might fal from his Kingdom, yet ſtil the knot of the queſtion would hold, whether he can be diſpoſſeſſed of his Regal authoritie, by any power in the Pope, &amp; whether the Pope hath ſuch fulnes of power, to ſtrip a King of thoſe Royall robes, rights, and reuenewes of the Crowne, which were neuer giuen him by the Pope; as alſo by what authoritie of holy Scripture, the Pope is able to beare out himſelfe in this power, and to make it good.</p>
                  <p>But here the L. Card. ſtoutly ſaith in his owne defence by way of reioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
<note place="margin">Page 71.</note> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>As one text hath, Let euery ſoule be ſubiect vnto the higher powers; in like maner
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:23110:238"/>an other text hath, Obey your Prelates, and be ſubiect vnto your Paſtors:for they watch ouer your ſoules, as men that ſhall giue an accompt for your ſoules.</hi>
                     </q> This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is void of reaſon, and makes againſt himſelfe: For may not Prelates be obeyed and honoured, without Kings be depoſed? If Prelates preach the doctrine of the Coſpell, will they in the pulpit ſtirre vp ſubiects to rebell againſt Kings? Moreouer, whereas the vniuerſall Church in theſe daies is diuided into ſo many diſcrepant parts, that now Prelates neither doe nor can draw all one way; is it not exceeding hard, keeping our obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, to honour them all at once with due obedience? Nay is not here offered vnto me a dart out of the L. Cardinals armorie, to caſt at him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? For as God chargeth all men with obedience to Kings, and yet from that commaundement of God, the L. Cardinall would not haue it infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that Kings haue power to degrade Eccleſiaſticall Prelates: euen ſo God giueth charge to obey Prelates, yet doeth it not follow from hence, that Prelates haue power to depoſe Kings. Theſe two degrees of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence agree well together, and are each of them bounded with peculiar and proper limits.</p>
                  <p>But for ſo much as in this point, we haue on our ſide the whole auncient Church, which, albeit ſhe liued and groned for many aages together vnder heathen Emperours, heretikes, and perſecuters, did neuer ſo much as whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per a word about rebelling and falling from their Soueraigne Lords, and was neuer by any mortall creature freed from the oath of allegiance to the Emperour; the Cardinall is not vnwilling to graunt, that ancient Chriſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in thoſe times were bound to performe ſuch fidelity and allegiance, for as much as the Church (the Cardinall for ſhame durſt not ſay the Pope) then had not abſolued them of their oath. No doubt a pleaſant dreame, or a merry conceit rather, to imagine the Biſhop of Rome was armed with power to take away the Empire of the world from <hi>Nero,</hi> or <hi>Claudius,</hi> or <hi>Domitianus;</hi> to whom it was not knowen, whether the citie of Rome had any Biſhop at all. Is it not a maſter-ieſt, of a ſtraine moſt ridiculous, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe the Grand-maſters and abſolute Lords of the whole world, had a ſent ſo dull, that they were not able to ſmell out, and to noſe things vnder their owne noſes? that they ſaw ſo little with other mens eies and their owne, that within their capitall citie, they could not ſpie that Soueraigne armed with ordinary and lawfull authority to degrade, and to turne them out of their renowned Empire? Doubtleſſe the ſaid Emperours, vaſſals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the Popes Empire, are to be held excuſed for not acknowledging and honouring the Pope in quality of their Lord, as became his vaſſals; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not know there was any ſuch power in the world, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times haue magnified and adored vnder the qualitie of Pope: For the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Rome in thoſe times, were of no greater authoritie, power, and meanes, then ſome of the Biſhops are in theſe daies within my Kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>But certes thoſe Popes of that primitiue aage, thought it not expedient in the ſaid times to draw their ſwords: they exerciſed their power in a more
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:23110:239"/>mild and ſoft kind of carriage toward thoſe miſerable Emperours, for three ſeuerall reaſons alledged by the L. Cardinall.</p>
                  <p>The firſt: becauſe the Biſhops then durſt not by their cenſures whet and prouoke thoſe Emperours, for feare of plunging the Church in a Sea of perſecutions. But if I be not cleane voide of common ſenſe, this reaſon ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to charge not onely the Biſhops of Rome, but all the auncient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſt beſides, with deepe diſſimulation and hypocriſie: For it is all one as if he had profeſſed, that all their obedience to their Soueraignes, was but counterfeit, and extorted, or wrong out of them by force; that all the ſubmiſſiue ſupplications of the auncient Fathers, the aſſured teſtimonies and pledges of their allegiance, humilitie, and patience, were but certaine formes of diſguiſed ſpeech, proceeding not freely from the ſuggeſtions of fidelity, but faintly and fainedly, or at leaſt from the ſtrong twitches and violent conuulſions of feare. Whereupon it followes, that all their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and puniſhments, euen to the death, are wrongfully honoured with the title, and crowned with the crowne of Martyrdome; becauſe their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience proceeded not from their owne free choice and election, but was taught by the force of neceſſitie, as by compulſion: and whereas they had not mutinouſly and rebelliouſly riſen in armes, to aſſwage the ſcorching heat and burning flames of tyrannicall perſecuters, it was not for want of will, but for lacke of power. Which falſe and forged imputation, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue cleared themſelues of in their writings.

                     <hi>The ſouldiers of Christ ſerued a Heathen Emperour: But when the cauſe of Chriſt was called in question, they acknowledged none but Chriſt in heauen: When the Emperor would haue them to ſerue, and to perfume his idols with frankincenſe, they gaue obedience to God, rather then to the Emperour.</hi> After which words,
<note place="margin">Page 82.</note> the very ſame words alleadged by the L.

But his Lordſhip by his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured pretences doeth manifeſtly prouoke and ſtirre vp the people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, ſo ſoone as they know their own ſtrength to beare out a rebellious practiſe: Whereupon it followes, that in caſe their conſpiracie ſhall take no good effect, all the blame and fault muſt lie, not in their diſloyalty and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but in the bad choice of their times for the beſt aduantage, and in the want of taking a trew ſight of their owne weakeneſſe. Let ſtirring ſpirits be trained vp in ſuch practicall precepts, let deſperate wits be ſeaſoned with ſuch rules of diſcipline; and what need we, or how can wee wonder they contriue Powder-conſpiracies, and practiſe the damnable art of parricides?</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Iulian,</hi> his Lordſhip falles vpon <hi>Valentinian</hi> the younger, who maintaining Arrianiſme with great and open violence, might haue bene depoſed by the Chriſtians from his Empire, and yet (ſay wee) they neuer dream'd of any ſuch practiſe. Heere the L. Cardinall maketh anſwere:
<note place="margin">Pag. 82.</note> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>The Christians mooued with respect vnto the freſh memory both of the brother and father, as alſo vnto the weake estate of the ſonnes young yeeres, abstained from all counſels and courſes of ſharper effect and operation.</hi>
                     </q> To which anſwere I replie: theſe are but friuolous coniectures, deuiſed and framed to ticle his owne fancie: For had <hi>Valentinianus</hi> the younger beene the ſonne of an <hi>Arrian,</hi> and had then alſo attained to threeſcore yeeres of aage, they would neuer haue borne themſelues in other faſhion then they did, towards their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Then the Cardinall goeth on: The people would not abandon the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:23110:240"/>factious and ſeditious party, but were ſo firme or obſtinate rather for the faction, that <hi>Valentinian</hi> for feare of the tumultuous vproares was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to giue way, and was threatened by the ſouldiers, that except hee would adhere vnto the Catholikes, they would yeeld him no aſſiſtance, nor ſtand for his partie. Now this anſwere of the L. Cardinall makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, concerning the Popes power to pull downe Kings from their ſtately neſt. Let vs take notice of his proper conſequence. <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi> was afraid of the popular tumult at <hi>Milan:</hi> the Pope therefore hath power to curbe Hereticall Kings by depoſition. Now marke what diſtance is betweene <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> what difference betweene the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> betweene a popular tumult, and a iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatorie ſentence; betweene fact and right, things done by the people or ſouldiers of <hi>Milan,</hi> and things to be done according to right and law by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> the ſame diſtance, the ſame difference (if not farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) is betweene the L.

The mad commotion of the people was not heere ſo much to bee regarded, as the ſad inſtruction of the Paſtour, of their good and godly Paſtour S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> ſo farre from hartening the people of <hi>Milan</hi> to rebel, that being Biſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> he offered himſelfe to ſuffer Martydome: <hi>If the Emperour abuſe his Imperiall authority,</hi> (for ſo <hi>Theodoret</hi> hath recited his words) <hi>to tyrannize there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, heere am I ready to ſuffer death.</hi> And what reſiſtance he made againſt his L.

Then were the times
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:23110:240"/>or neuer, for the Pope to vnſheath his weapons, and to vncaſe his arrowes of depoſition; then were the times to draw them out of his quiuer, and to ſhoot at all ſuch <hi>Arrian</hi> heads; then were the times by diſpenſations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe their ſubiects of their oathes, by that peremptorie meanes to aide and ſtrengthen the Catholique cauſe: But in that aage the ſaid weapons were not knowne to haue bene hammered in the Pontificall forge.</p>

But he telleth vs, that by the feare of God before his eyes and in his heart, he was bridled and reſtrained from any ſuch intent; as elſewhere we haue obſerued:

                  <p>What can we tearme this aſſertion of the L. Cardinal, but open charging the moſt ancient Biſhops of Rome with crueltie, when they would not ſuccour the Church of CHRIST oppreſſed by tyrants, whoſe oppreſſion they had power to repreſſe by depoſing the oppreſſors. Is it credible, that IESVS CHRIST hath giuen a Commiſſion to S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſors for ſo many aages, without any power to execute their Commiſſion, or to make any vſe thereof by practiſe? Is it credible, that hee hath giuen them a ſword to bee kept in the ſcabbard, without drawing once in a thouſand yeeres? Is it credible, that in the times when Popes were moſt deboſhed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning themſelues to all ſorts of corrupt and vitious courſes, as is teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by their owne flatterers and beſt affected ſeruants; is it credible that in thoſe times they began to vnderſtand the vertue &amp; ſtrength of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion? For if either feare or lacke of power, was the cauſe of holding their hands, and voluntarie binding of themſelues to the Peace or good behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: wherefore is not ſome one Pope at leaſt produced, who hath complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that he was hindered from executing the power that CHRIST had conferred vpon his Pontificall See? Wherefore is not ſome one of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and holy Fathers alledged, by whom the Pope hath bene aduiſed and exhorted to take courage, to ſtand vpon he vigor and ſinewes of his Papall Office, to vnſheath and vncaſe his bolts of thunder againſt vngodly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and grieuous enemies to the Church? wherefore liuing vnder Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and gracious Emperours, haue they not made knowne the reaſons, why they were hindred from drawing the pretended ſword; leſt long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of not vſing the ſword ſo many aages, might make it ſo to ruſt in the ſcabbard, that when there ſhould be occaſion to vſe the ſaid ſword, it could not be drawne at all; and leſt ſo long cuſtome of not vſing the ſame, ſhould confirme preſcription to their greater preiudice? If weakeneſſe be a iuſt let, how is it come to paſſe, that Popes haue enterpriſed to depoſe
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:23110:241"/>
                     <hi>Philip the Faire, Lewis</hi> the XII. and ELIZABETH my predeceſſor of happy memorie; (to let paſſe others) in whom experience hath well proued, how great inequalitie was betweene their ſtrengths? Yea, for the moſt part from thence grow moſt grieuous troubles and warres, which iuſtly recoile and light vpon his owne head; as happened to <hi>Gregorie</hi> the VII. and <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the VIII. This no doubt is the reaſon, wherefore the Pope neuer ſets in (for feare of ſuch inconueniences) to blaſt a King with lightning and thunder of depoſition, but when hee perceiues the troubled waters of the Kingdome by ſome ſtrong faction ſetled in his Eſtate; or when the King is confined and bordered by ſome Princemore potent, who thirſteth after the prey, and is euer gaping for ſome occaſion to picke a quarrell. The King ſtanding in ſuch eſtate, is it not as eaſie for the Pope to pull him downe, as it is for a man with one hand to thruſt downe a tottering wall, when the groundſill is rotten, the ſtuddes vnpind and nodding or ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding towards the ground? But if the King ſhall beare downe and breake the faction within the Realme; if hee ſhall get withall the vpper hand of his enemies out of the Kingdome; then the holy Father preſents him with pardons neuer ſued for, neuer asked, and in afathers indulgence forſooth, giues him leaue ſtill to hold the Kingdome, that hee was not able by all his force to wreſt and wring out of his hand, no more then the club of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> out of his fiſt. How many worthy Princes, incenſed by the Pope, to conſpire againſt Soueraigne Lords their Maſters, and by open rebellion to worke ſome change in their Eſtates, haue miſcarried in the action, with loſſe of life, or honour, or both? For example; <hi>Rodulphus</hi> Duke of <hi>Sueuia</hi> was eg'd on by the Pope, againſt <hi>Henry</hi> IIII. of that name Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. How many maſſacres, how many deſolations of Cities and townes, how many bloody battels enſued thereupon? Let hiſtories bee ſearched, let iuſt accompts be taken, and beſide ſieges layde to Cities, it will appeare by trew computation, that <hi>Henry</hi> the IIII. and <hi>Frederic</hi> the fiſt, fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue threeſcore battels, in defence of their owne right againſt enemies of the Empire, ſtirred vp to armes by the Pope of Rome. How much Chriſtian blood was then ſpilt in theſe bloody battels, it paſſeth mans wit, penne, or tongue to expreſſe. And to giue a little touch vnto mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at home; doeth not his Holineſſe vnderſtand right well the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Papiſts in my Kingdome? Doeth not his Holmeſſe neuertheſeſſe animate my Papiſts to rebellion, and forbid my Papiſts to take the Oath of Allegiance? Doeth not his Holineſſe by this meanes draw (ſo much as in him lyeth) perſecution vpon the backes of my Papiſts as vpon rebels, and expoſe their life as it were vpon the open ſtall, to be ſold at a very eaſie price? All theſe examples, either ioynt or ſeuerall, are manifeſt and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proofes, that feare to draw miſchiefe and perſecution vpon the Church, hath not barred the Popes from thundering againſt Emperours and Kings, whenſoeuer they conceiued any hope, by their fulminations to aduance their greatneſſe.</p>

                        <hi>He tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs there is very great difference betweene Pagan Emperours, and Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Pagan Emperours who neuer did homage to Christ, who neuer were by their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects receiued, with condition to acknowledge perpetuall ſubiection vnto the Empire of Chriſt; who neuer were bound by oath and mutuall contract betweene Prince and ſubiect. Chriſtian Princes who ſlide backe by Apoſtaſie, degenerate by Arrianiſme, or fall away by Mahometiſme.</hi>
                     </q> Touching the latter of theſe two, (as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe ſaith) <q>
                        <hi>If they ſhall as it were take an oath, and make a vowe contrary to their first oath and vow made and taken when they were installed, and contrary to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition vnder which they receiued the Scepter of their Fathers; if they withall ſhall turne perſecutors of the Catholike religion;</hi>
                     </q> touching theſe I ſay, the L. Cardinal holds, that without queſtion they may bee remooued from their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: He telleth vs not by whom, but euery where he meaneth by the Pope. Touching Kings depoſed by the Pope vnder pretence of ſtupidity, as <hi>Childeric;</hi> or of matrimoniall cauſes, as <hi>Philip</hi> I. or for collating of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as <hi>Philip</hi> the Faire; not one word: By that point he eaſily glideth, and ſhuffles it vp in ſilence, for feare of diſtaſting the Pope on the one ſide, or his auditors on the other.</p>
                  <p>Now in alledging this reaſon, his Lordſhip makes all the world a witnes, that in depoſing of Kings, the Pope hath no eye of regard to the benefit and ſecuritie of the Church: For ſuch Princes as neuer ſuckt other milke then that of Infidelitie, and perſecution of Religion, are no leſſe noiſome and pernicious vermin to the Church, then if they had ſucked of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:23110:242"/>breaſts. And as for the greatneſſe of the ſinne or offence, it ſeemes to me there is very little difference in the matter. For a Prince that neuer did ſweare any religious obedience to <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> is bound no leſſe to ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, then if he had taken a ſolemne oath: As the ſonne that rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſtands vp againſt his father, is in equall degree of ſinne, whether he hath ſworne or not ſworne obedience to his father; becauſe he is bound to ſuch obedience, not by any voluntarie contract or couenant, but by the law of Nature. The commaundement of God to kiſſe the Sonne, whom the Father hath confirmed and ratified King of Kings, doeth equally bind all Kings, as well Pagans as Chriſtians. On the other ſide, who denies, who doubts, that <hi>Conſtantius</hi> Emperour at his firſt ſteppe or entrance into the Empire, did not ſweare and bind himſelfe by ſolemne vowe, to keepe the rules and to maintaine the precepts of the Orthodox faith, or that he did not receiue his fathers Empire vpon ſuch condition? This notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> pulled not <hi>Conſtantius</hi> from his Imperiall throne, but <hi>Conſtantius</hi> remooued the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> from his Papall See. And were it ſo, that an oath taken by a King at his conſecration, and after viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is a ſufficient cauſe for the Pope to depoſe an Apoſtate or hereticall Prince; then by good conſequence the Pope may in like ſort depoſe a King, who beeing neither dead in Apoſtaſie, nor ſicke of Hereſie, doeth neglect onely the due adminiſtration of iuſtice to his loyall ſubiects: For his oath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at conſecration importeth likewiſe, that he ſhall miniſter iuſtice to his people. A point wherein the holy Father is held ſhort by the L. Cardinall, who dares preſcribe new lawes to the Pope, and preſumes to limit his <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse of power,</hi> within certaine meeres and head-lands, extending the Popes power only to the depoſing of Chriſtian Kings, when they turne Apoſtats forſaking the Catholike faith; and not ſuch Princes as neuer breathed any thing but pure Paganiſme, and neuer ſerued vnder the colours of Ieſus Chriſt. Meane while his Lordſhip forgets, that King <hi>Attabaliba</hi> was depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Pope from his Kingdome of <hi>Peru,</hi> and the ſaid Kingdome was conferred vpon the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> though the ſaid poore King of <hi>Peru,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forſooke his heathen ſuperſtition; and though the turning of him out of his terreſtriall Kingdome was no way to conuert him vnto the faith of Chriſt.
<note place="margin">Pag. 77.</note> Yea his Lordſhip a little after telleth vs himſelfe, that <hi>Be the Turkes poſſeſsion in the conquests that he maketh ouer Chriſtians neuer ſo auncient, yet by no long tract of time whatſoeuer, can he gaine ſo much as a thumbes breadth of preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> that is to ſay, the Turke for all that is but a diſſeiſor, one that violently and wilfully keeps an other man from his owne, and by good right may be diſpoſſeſſed of the ſame: whereas notwithſtanding the Turkiſh Emperours neuer fauoured nor ſauoured Chriſtianitie. Let vs runne ouer the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Kings whom the Pope hath dared and preſumed to depoſe; and hardly will any one be found, of whom it may be trewly auouched, that he hath taken an oath contrary to his oath of ſubiection to <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> or that he hath wilfully caſt himſelfe into Apoſtaticall defection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="441" facs="tcp:23110:242"/>And certes to any man that weighs the matter with due conſideration, it wil be found apparantly falſe, that Kings of <hi>France</hi> haue bene receiued of their ſubiects at any time, with condition to ſerue IESVS CHRIST. They were actually Kings before they came forth to the ſolemnitie of their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring, before they vſed any ſtipulation or promiſe to their ſubiects. For in hereditary kingdoms, (nothing more certaine, nothing more vncontroule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) the Kings death inſtantly maketh liuery and ſeiſin of the Royaltie, to his next ſucceſſour. Nor is it materiall to replie, that a King ſucceeding by right of inheritance, takes an oath in the perſon of his predeceſſor. For euery oath is perſonall, proper to the perſon by whom it is taken: and to God no liuing creature can ſweare, that his owne ſonne or his heire ſhall proue an honeſt man. Well may the father, and with great ſolemnitie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that he will exhort his heire apparant with all his power and the beſt of his endeauours, to feare God and to practiſe piety. If the fathers oath be agreeable to the dueties of godlineſſe, the ſonne is bound thereby, whether he take an oath, or take none. On the other ſide, if the fathers oath come from the puddles of impietie, the ſonne is bound thereby to goe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way. If the fathers oath concerne things of indifferent nature, and ſuch as by the variety or change of times, become either pernicious or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; then it is free for the Kings next ſucceſſor and heire, prudently to fit and proportion his Lawes vnto the times preſent, and to the beſt benefit of the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>When I call theſe things to mind with ſome attention, I am out of all doubt, his Lordſhip is very much to ſeeke, in the right ſenſe and nature of his Kings oath taken at his Coronation, to defend the Church, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere in the Catholike faith: For what is more vnlike and leſſe credible then this conceit, that after <hi>Clouis</hi> had reigned 15. yeeres in the ſtate of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſme, and then receiued holy Baptiſme, he ſhould become Chriſtian vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this condition, That in caſe hee ſhould afterward reuolt from the Faith, it ſhould then bee in the power of the Church, to turne him out of his Kingdome? But had any ſuch conditionall ſtipulation beene made by <hi>Clouis,</hi> in very good earneſt and trewth; yet would hee neuer haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that his depoſing ſhould bee the acte of the Romane Biſhop, but rather of thoſe (whether Peeres or people, or whole body of the State) by whom he had bene aduanced to the Kingdome. Let vs heare the trewth, and this is the trewth: It is farre from the cuſtomary vſe in <hi>France,</hi> for their Kings to take any ſuch oath, or to vſe any ſuch ſtipulation with their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. If any King or Prince whereſoeuer, doth vſe an oath or ſolemne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in theſe expreſſe termes, <hi>Let me loſe my Kingdome, or my life, be that day my laſt both for life and reigne, when I ſhall firſt reuolt from the Chriſtian Religion:</hi> By theſe words he calleth vpon God for vengeance, hee vſeth imprecation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his owne head: but hee makes not his Crowne to ſtoupe by this meanes to any power in the Pope, or in the Church, or in the people.</p>
                  <p>And touching inſcriptions vpon coynes, of which point his Lordſhip
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:23110:243"/>ſpeaketh by the way; verely the nature of the money or coine (the ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and minting whereof is one of the marks of the Prince his dignity and Soueraignty) is not changed by bearing the letters of Chriſts Name on the reuerſe or on the front. Such characters of Chriſts Name, are aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and inſtructions to the people, that in ſhewing and yeelding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto the King, they are obedient vnto Chriſt; &amp; thoſe Princes likewiſe, who are ſo wel aduiſed, to haue the moſt ſacred Names inſcribed and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their coines, doe take and acknowledge <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> for ſupreme King of Kings. The ſaid holy characters are no repreſentation or profeſſion, that any Kings Crowne dependeth vpon the Church, or can be taken away by the Pope. The L. Cardinal indeed ſo beareth vs in hand. But he inuerts the words of <hi>Ieſus Christ,</hi> and wrings them out of the right ioynt: For Chriſt without all ambiguitie and circumlocution, by the image and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the money, doeth directly and expreſſely prooue <hi>Caeſar</hi> to bee free from ſubiection, and entirely Soueraigne. Now if ſuch a ſupreme and Soueraigne Prince, at any time ſhall bandie and combine againſt God, and thereby ſhall become a rebellious and perfidious Prince; doubtleſſe for ſuch diſloyaltie he ſhall deſerue, that God would take from him all hope of life eternall: and yet hereby neither Pope nor people hath reaſon to bee puft vp, in their power to depriue him of his temporall Kingdome.</p>

                     <q>The L.
<note place="margin">Page 76.</note> Cardinall ſaith beſides; <hi>The champions of the Popes power to depoſe Kings, doe expound that commandement of</hi> S. Paul, <hi>whereby euery ſoule is made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto the ſuperiour powers, to bee a prouiſionall precept or caution accommodated to the times; and to ſtand in force, onely vntll the Church were growen in ſtrength vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a ſcantling, that it might be in the power of the faithfull, without ſhaking the pillars of Chriſtian ſtate, to ſtand in the breach, and cautelouſly to prouide that none but Chriſtian Princes might be receiued; according to the Law in Deut Thou ſhalt make thee a King from among thy brethren.</hi> The reaſon whereupon they ground, is this: <hi>Becauſe</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, It is a ſhame for Chriſtians to be iudged vnder vniuſt Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, in mattrs or buſineſse, which they had one againſt another: For which inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> Iuſtinian <hi>after prouided by Law; when hee ordeined that no Infidel nor Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike might be admitted to the adminiſtration of iustice in the Common-wealth.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which words of the Cardinall, the word <hi>Receiued,</hi> is to bee obſerued eſpecially and aboue the reſt: For by chopping in that word, hee doeth nimbly and with a tricke of <hi>Legier-demain,</hi> transforme or change the very ſtate of the queſtion. For the queſtion or iſſue of the cauſe, is not about receiuing, eſtabliſhing, or chooſing a Prince; (as in thoſe Nations where the Kingdome goes by election) but about doing homage to the Prince, when God hath ſetled him in the Kingdome, and hath caſt it vpon a Prince by hereditary ſucceſſion: For that which is writtten, <hi>Thou ſhalt make thee a King,</hi> doeth no way concerne and touch the people of <hi>France</hi> in theſe dayes: becauſe the making of their King hath not of long time been tyed to their election. The paſſage therefore in Deuter. makes nothing to the purpoſe; no more then doth <hi>Iuſtinians</hi> law: For it is our free and voluntary
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:23110:243"/>confeſſion, that a Chriſtian Prince is to haue ſpeciall care of the Lawes, and to prouide that no vnbeleeuer be made Lord Chiefe-Iuſtice of the Land, that no Infidel be put in truſt with adminiſtration of Iuſtice to the people. But here the iſſue doeth not direct vs to ſpeake of Delegates, of ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Magiſtrates, and ſuch as are in Commiſſion from the Prince, but of the ſupreame Prince himſelfe, the Soueraigne Magiſtrate ordained by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and confirmed by ſucceſſion. Our queſtion is, whether ſuch a Prince can be vnthroned by the Pope, by whom he was not placed in the Throne; and whether the Pope can deſpoile ſuch a Prince, of that Royaltie which was neuer giuen him by the Pope, vnder any pretended colour and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of hereſie, of ſtupiditie, or infringing the priuiledges of Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or tranſgreſſing the Lawes and lines of holy Matrimonie.</p>
                  <p>Now that S. <hi>Pauls</hi> commandement which bindeth euery ſoule in the bands of ſubiection vnto the higher powers, is no precept giuen by way of <hi>prouiſo,</hi> and onely to ſerue the times, but a ſtanding and a perpetuall rule, it is hereby more then manifeſt. S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath grounded this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon certaine reaſons, not onely conſtant and permanent by their proper nature, but likewiſe neceſſary for euery ſtate, condition, and reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the times. His reaſons; <hi>Becauſe all powers are ordained of God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe reſisting of powers is reſisting the ordinance of God: becauſe the Magistrate beares the ſword to execute iustice: becauſe obedience and ſubiection to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is neceſſary, not onely for feare of his wrath, or feare of puniſhment, but alſo for conſcience ſake.</hi> It is therefore a caſe grounded vpon conſcience, it is not a Law deuiſed by humane wiſedome; it is not faſhionable to the qualities of the times. Apoſtolicall inſtructions for the right informing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, are not changeable according to times and ſeaſons. To vſe the L. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals language, and to follow his fancie in the matter, is to make way for two peſtiferous miſchiefes: Firſt, let it be free and lawfull for Chriſtians, to hold the commanding rules of GOD for prouiſionall cautions, and what followes?

Then againe, for the other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe: The glorious triumphes of moſt bleſſed Martyrs in their vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able torments and ſufferings, by the L.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (according to his new fiction) they haue giuen place to the violence and furie of heathen Magiſtrates, not in obedience to the neceſſary and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Commandement of God, but rather to a prouiſionall direction, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modated to the humours of the times. And therfore the L. Cardinal hath vſed none other clay wherewith to dawbe ouer his deuiſe, but plaine falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of holy Scripture: For he makes the Apoſtle ſay to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>It is a ſhame for Chriſtians to bee iudged vnder vnbeleeuing Magistrates;</hi> whereas in that whole context of Paul, there is no ſuch matter.

                     </note> he doeth not ſay it is a ſhame for a beleeuer to be iudged vnder an Infidel, but he makes them aſhamed of
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:23110:244"/>their vngodly courſe, and vnchriſtian practiſe, that in ſuing and impleading one another, they layd their actions of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention in the Courts of vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Iudges. The ſhame was not in bearing that yoke which God had char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their necks withall, but in deuouring and eating vp one an other with Writs of <hi>habeas corpus,</hi> and with other Proceſſes; as alſo in vncouering the ſhame, in laying open the ſhamefull parts and prankes played by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, before Infidels, to the great ſcandall of the Church. Here I ſay the L. Cardinall is taken in a tricke of manifeſt falſification. If therefore a King when he ſalls to play the heretike, deſerueth to be depoſed; why ſhould not a Cardinall when he falls to play the iuggler with holy Scripture, deſerue to be diſrobed?</p>
                  <p>Meane while the indifferent Reader is to conſider, how greatly this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is preiudicial, and how full of danger, to Chriſtians liuing vnder he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall or Pagan Princes. For make it once knowne to the Emperour of Turkes, let him once get neuer ſo little a ſmacke of this doctrine; that Chriſtians liuing vnder his Empire doe take Gods commandement, for obedience to Princes whom they count Infidels, to be onely a prouiſional precept for a time, and wait euery houre for all occaſions to ſhake off the yoke of his bondage; doubtleſſe he will neuer ſpare with all ſpeed to roote the whole ſtocke, with all the armes and branches of Chriſtians out of his dominions. Adde hereunto the L. Cardinals former determination; that poſſeſſion kept neuer ſo long by the Turke in his Conqueſts ouer Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, gaines him not by ſo long tract of time one inch of preſcription; and it will appeare, that his Lordſhip puts the Turkiſh Emperour in minde, and by his inſtruction leades the ſaid Emperour as it were by the hand, to haue no maner of affiance in his Chriſtian ſubiects; and withall to afflict his poore Chriſtians with all ſorts of moſt grieuous and cruell torments. In this regard the poore Chriſtans of Graecia and Syria, muſt needs be very little beholden to his Lordſhip. As for my ſelfe, and my Popiſh Subiects, to whom I am no leſſe then an heretike forſooth am not I by this doctrine of the Cardinall, pricked and whetted againſt my naturall inclination, to turne clemencie into rigour; ſeeing that by his doctrine my ſubiects are made to beleeue, they owe me ſubiection onely by way of <hi>prouiſo,</hi> and with waiting the occaſion to worke my vtter deſtruction and finall ruine; the rather, becauſe Turkes, miſcreants, and heretikes are marſhalled by the Cardinall in the ſame ranke; and heretikes are counted worſe, yea more iuſtly depoſeable, then Turkes and Infidels, as irreligious breakers and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters of their oath? Who ſeeth not here how great indignitie is offered to me a Chriſtian King, paralleld with Infidels, reputed worſe then a Turke, taken for an vſurper of my Kingdomes, reckoned a Prince, to whom ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects owe a forced obedience by way of prouiſion, vntill they ſhall haue meanes to ſhake off the yoke, and to bare my temples of the Crowne, which neuer can be pulled from the ſacred Head, but with loſſe of the head it ſelfe?</p>

That expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a deuiſe and inuention of the Pope, whereby he might come to be infeoffed in the Kingdomes of Chriſtian Princes. For then all ſuch of the <hi>French, Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Germaines,</hi> as vndertooke the Croiſade, became the Popes meere vaſſals. Then all robbers by the high way ſide, adulterers, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throats, and baſe bankerupts, were exempted from the Secular and Ciuill power, their cauſes were ſped in Conſiſtorian Courts, ſo ſoone as they had gotten the Croſſe on their caſſocks or coat-armours, and had vowed to ſerue in the expedition for the Leuant. Then for the Popes pleaſure and at his commaundement, whole countryes were emptied of their Nobles and common ſouldiers. Then they made long marches into the Leuant: For what purpoſe? Onely to die vpon the points of the <hi>Saracens</hi> pikes, or by the edge of their barbarous courtelaſſes, battle-axes, fauchions, and other weapons, without any benefit and aduantage to themſelues or others. Then the Nobles were driuen to ſell their goodly Mannors, and auncient demaines to the Church-men, at vnder priſes and low rates; the very roote from which a great part of the Church and Church-mens reuenewes hath ſprung and growne to ſo great height. Then, to be ſhort,

                  <p>Let vs now by way of compariſon behold Ieſus Chriſt paying tribute vnto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and the Pope making <hi>Caeſar</hi> to pay him tribute: Ieſus Chriſt perſwading the Iewes to pay tribute vnto an heathen Emperour, and the Pope diſpenſing with ſubiects for their obedience to Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours: Ieſus Chriſtrefuſing to arbitrate a controuerſie of inheritance part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able betweene two priuate parties, and the Pope thruſting in himſelfe without warrant or Commiſſion to bee abſolute Iudge in the depoſing of Kings: Ieſus Chriſt profeſſing that his Kingdome is not of this world, and the Pope eſtabliſhing himſelfe in a terrene Empire. In like manner the Apoſtles forſaking all their goods to followe Chriſt, and the Pope robbing Chriſtians of their goods; the Apoſtles perſecuted by Pagan Emperours, and the Pope now ſetting his foote on the very throate of Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, then proudly treading Imperiall Crownes vnder his feete. By this compariſon, the L. Cardinals allegation of Scripture in fauour of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Pope, is but a kind of puppet-play, to make Ieſus Chriſt a mocking ſtocke, rather then to ſatisfie his auditors with any ſound precepts and wholefome inſtructions. Hereof he ſeemeth to giue ſome inckling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: For after he hath beene plentifull in citing authorities of Scripture, and of newe Doctors, which make for the Popes power to depoſe Kings; at laſt he comes in with a faire and open confeſſion,

                     </q> For anſwere to this reaſon, he brings in the defendants of depoſition, ſpeaking <q>after this maner; <hi>In the Kingdome of</hi> France <hi>the ſtrict execution of lawes decreed in Court againſt Heretikes, is fauourably ſuſpended and ſtopped, for the preſeruation of peace and publike tranquilitie.</hi> He ſaith elſewhere; <hi>Conniuence is vſed towards theſe Heretikes inregard of their multitude, becauſe a notable part of the French Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and State is made all of Heretikes.</hi>
                     </q> I ſuppoſe that out of ſpeciall charitie, he would haue thoſe Heretikes of his owne making, forewarned what courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vſe and entreaty they are to expect; when he affirmeth that execution of the lawes is but ſuſpended: For indeed ſuſpenſions hold but for a time. But in a cauſe of that nature and importance, I dare promiſe my ſelfe, that my moſt honoured brother the King of <hi>France,</hi> will make vſe of other counſell: will rather ſeeke the amitie of his neighbour Princes, and the peace of his Kingdome: will beare in mind the great and faithfull ſeruice of thoſe, who in matter of religion diſſent from his Maieſtie, as of the onely men that haue preſerued and ſaued the Crowne for the King his father, of moſt glorious memorie. I am perſwaded my brother of <hi>France</hi> wil beleeue, that his liege people pretended by the L. Cardinall to bee heretikes, are not halfe ſo bad as my Romane Catholike ſubiects, who by ſecret practiſes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine my life, ſerue a forreine Souereigne, are diſcharged by his Bulls of their obedience due to me their naturall Souereigne, are bound (by the maximes and rules publiſhed and maintained in fauour of the Pope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this full and famous aſſemblie of the Eſtate at <hi>Paris;</hi> if the ſaid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes be of any weight and authoritie) to hold mee for no lawfull King, are there taught and inſtructed, that <hi>Pauls</hi> commandemement concerning ſubiection vnto the higher Powers, aduerſe to their profeſſed religion, is onely a prouiſionall precept, framed to the times, and watching for the opportunitie to ſhake off the yoake. All which notwithſtanding, I deale with ſuch Romane-Catholikes by the rules and wayes of Princely cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie; their heinous and pernicious error, in effect no leſſe then the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall crime of high treaſon, I vſe to call ſome diſeaſe or diſtemper of the mind. Laſt of all, I beleeue my ſaid brother of <hi>France</hi> will ſet downe in his tables, as in record, how little hee ſtandeth ingaged to the L. Cardinall in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: For thoſe of the reformed Religion profeſſe and proclaime, that next vnder God, they owe their preſeruation and ſafetie to the wiſedome and benignity of their Kings. But now comes the Cardinall, and he ſeekes to ſteale this perſwaſion out of their hearts: He tells them in open Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and without any going about buſhes, that all their welfare and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie ſtandeth in their multitude, and in the feare which others conceiue
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:23110:246"/>to trouble the State, by the ſtrict execution of lawes againſt Heretikes.</p>
                  <p>He addeth moreouer,
<note place="margin">Note by the way that here the Church of Rome is called a Sect.</note> that <hi>In caſe a third Sect ſhould peepe out and growe vp in</hi> France, <hi>the profeſſors thereof ſhould ſuffer confiſcation of their goods, with loſſe of life it ſelfe; as hath bene practiſed at</hi> Geneua <hi>against</hi> Seruetus, <hi>and in</hi> England <hi>againſt</hi> Arians. My anſwere is this, That puniſhments for heretikes, duely and according to Law conuicted, are ſet downe by decrees of the ciuill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, bearing rule in the countrey where the ſaid heretikes inhabite, and not by any ordinances of the Pope. I ſay withall, the L. Cardinall hath no reaſon to match and parallell the reformed Churches with <hi>Seruetus</hi> and the <hi>Arians:</hi> For thoſe heretikes were powerfully conuicted by Gods word, and lawfully condemned by the ancient Generall Councils, where they were permitted and admitted to plead their owne cauſe in perſon. But as for the trewth profeſſed by me, and thoſe of the reformed Religion, it was neuer yet hiſſed out of the Schooles, nor caſt out of any Council, (like ſome Parliament bills) where both ſides haue bene heard with like indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencie. Yea, what Council ſoeuer hath bene offered vnto vs in theſe latter times, it hath bene propoſed with certaine preſuppoſitions: as, That his Holineſſe (beeing a partie in the cauſe, and conſequently to come vnder iudgement as it were to the barre vpon his triall) ſhall be the Iudge of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize with Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Determiner:</hi> it ſhall bee celebrated in a citie of no ſafe acceſſe, without ſafe conduct or conuoy to come or goe at pleaſure, and without danger: it ſhall be aſſembled of ſuch perſons with free ſuffrage and voyce, as vphold this rule, (which they haue already put in practiſe againſt <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prage</hi>) that faith giuen, and oath taken to an Heretike, muſt not be obſerued.</p>
                  <p>Now then to reſume our former matter; If the Pope hitherto hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer preſumed, for pretended hereſie to confiſcate by ſentence, either the lands or the goods of priuate perſons, or common people of the French Nation, wherefore ſhould hee dare to diſpoſſeſſe Kings of their Royall thrones? wherefore takes he more vpon him ouer Kings, then ouer priuate perſons; wherefore ſhall the ſacred heads of Kings be more churliſhly, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuilly, and rigorouſly handled, then the hoods of the meaneſt people? Here the L. Cardinal in ſtead of a direct anſwer, breakes out of the liſts, alledging cleane from the purpoſe examples of heretikes puniſhed, not by the Pope, but by the ciuill Magiſtrate of the Countrey: But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeakes to the point with a more free and open heart: hee is abſolute and reſolute in this opinion, that his Holineſſe hath plenary power to diſpoſe all Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall eſtates and matters in the whole world; <hi>I am confident</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) <hi>and I ſpeake it with aſſurance,

<pb n="449" facs="tcp:23110:246"/>Christ</hi> had power to diſpoſe no leſſe of priuate mens poſſeſſions, then of whole Realmes and Kingdomes at his pleaſure, if it had beene his pleaſure to diſplay the enſignes of his power? The ſame fulneſſe of power is likewiſe in the Pope. In good time: belike his Holineſſe is the ſole heire of Chriſt, in whole and in part.

By this Canon the Kingdome of <hi>Naples</hi> hath need to looke well vnto it ſelfe. For one duell it may fall into the Exchecquer of the Romane Church; becauſe that Kingdome payeth a Reliefe to the Church, as a Royaltie or Seignorie that holdeth in fee of the ſaid Church. And in <hi>France</hi> there is not one Lordſhip, not one Mannor, not one farme which the Pope by this meanes cannot ſhift ouer to a new Lord. His Lordſhip therefore had carried himſelfe and the cauſe much better, if in ſtead of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch idle ſhifts, he had by a more large aſſertion maintained the Popes power to diſpoſe of priuate mens poſſeſſions, with no leſſe right and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie then of Kingdomes: For what colour of reaſon can bee giuen, for making the Pope Lord of the whole, and not of the parts? for making him Lord of the forreſt in groſſe, and not of the trees in parcell? for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him Lord of the whole houſe, and not of the parlour or the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning chamber?</p>
                  <p>His Lordſhip alleadgeth yet an other reaſon, but of no better weight: <hi>Betweene the power of priuate owners ouer their goods, and the power of Kings ouer their eſtates, there is no little difference: For the goods of priuate perſons are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for their owners, and Princes for the benefit of their Common-wealths.</hi> Heare me now anſwere. If this Cardinal-reaſon hath any force to inferre, that a King may lawfully be depriued of his Kingdome for hereſie, but a priuate perſon cannot for the ſame crime be turned out of his manſion houſe; then it ſhall follow by the ſame reaſon, that a Father for the ſame cauſe may
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:23110:247"/>bee depriued of all power ouer his children, but a priuate owner cannot be depriued of his goods in the like caſe: becauſe goods are ordeined for the benefit and comfort of their owners, but fathers are ordeined for the good and benefit of their children: But moſt certain it is, that Kings repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the image of God in earth and Gods place, haue a better and cloſer ſeate in their chaires of Eſtate, then any priuate perſons haue in the ſaddle of their inheritances and patrimonies, which are dayly ſeene for ſleight cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to flit and to fall into the hands of new Lords: Whereas a Prince being the Head, cannot bee looſed in the proper ioynt, nor diſmounted; like a cannon when the carriage thereof is vnlockt, without a ſore ſhaking and a moſt grieuous diſlocation of all the members, yea, without ſubuerting the whole bodie of the State, whereby priuate perſons without number are inwrapped together in the ſame ruine; euen as the lower ſhrubs and other bruſh-wood are cruſhed in pieces altogether by the fall of a great oake. But ſuppoſe his Lordſhips reaſon were ſomewhat ponderous and ſolide withall, yet a King (which would not bee forgotten) is endowed not onely with the Kingdome, but alſo with the ancient Deſmenes and Crowne-lands, for which none can be ſo ſimple to ſay, The King was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined and created King; which neuertheleſſe he loſeth when hee loſeth his Crowne. Admit againe this reaſon were of ſome pith, to make mighty Kings more eaſily depoſeable then priuate perſons from their patrimonies; yet all this makes nothing for the deriuing and fetching of depoſition from the Popes Conſiſtorie.

                     </q> Now I am of the contrary beliefe, That an hereticall owner, or maſter of a family, hath greater power and meanes withall, to ſeduce his owne ſeruants and children, then a Prince hath to peruert his owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects; and yet for the contagion of Hereſie, and for corrupt religion, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not remoued from their parents, nor ſeruants are taken away from their maſters. Hiſtories abound with examples of moſt flouriſhing Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, vnder a Prince of contrary religion. And if things without life or ſoule are with leſſe danger left in an heretikes hands; why then ſhall not an hereticall King with more facilitie and leſſe danger keepe his Crowne, his Royall charge, his lands, his cuſtomes, his impoſts, &amp;c? For will any man, except he bee out of his wits, affirme theſe things to haue any life or ſoule? Or why ſhall it bee counted folly, to leaue a ſword in the hand of a mad Bedlam? Is not a ſword alſo without life and ſoule? For my part, I ſhould rather be of this minde; that poſſeſſion of things without reaſon, is more dangerous and pernicious in the hands of an euill maſter, then the poſſeſſion of things endued with life and reaſon: For things without
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:23110:247"/>life lacke both reaſon and iudgement, how to exempt and free themſelues from being inſtruments in euill and wicked actions, from being emploied to vngodly and abominable vſes. I will not deny, that an hereticall Prince is a plague, a pernicious and mortall ſickeneſſe to the ſoules of his ſubiects: But a breach made by one miſchiefe, muſt not bee filled vp with a greater inconuenience: An errour muſt not be ſhocked and ſhouldered with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loialtie, nor hereſie with periurie, nor impietie with ſedition and armed rebellion againſt GOD and the King. GOD, who vſeth to try and to ſchoole his Church, will neuer forſake his Church; nor hath need to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect his Church by any proditorious and prodigious practiſes of perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Chriſtians: For he makes his Church to be like the burning buſh: In the middeſt of the fire and flames of perſecutions, hee will prouide that ſhe ſhall not be conſumed, becauſe hee ſtandeth in the midſt of his Church. And ſuppoſe there may be ſome iuſt cauſe for the French, to play the rebels againſt their King; yet will it not follow, that ſuch rebellious motions are to be raiſed by the bellowes of the Romane Biſhop, to whoſe Paſtorall charge and office it is nothing proper, to intermeddle in the ciuill affaires of forraine Kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>Here is the ſumme and ſubſtance of the L. Cardinals whole diſcourſe, touching his pretence of the ſecond inconuenience. Which diſcourſe hee hath cloſed with a remarkeable confeſſion: to wit, that neither by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of holy Scripture, nor by the the teſtimonie and verdict of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, there hath bene any full deciſion of this queſtion. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof he falleth into admiration, that Lay-people haue gone ſo farre in audaciouſneſſe, as to labour that a doubtfull doctrine might for euer paſſe currant, and be taken for a new article of faith. <q>
                        <hi>What a ſhame, what a reproach is this? how full of ſcandall?</hi> for ſo his Lordſhip is pleaſed to cry out. <hi>This breakes into the ſeueralls and incloſures of the Church: this lets in whole herds of hereſies to graſe in her greene and ſweet pastures.</hi>
                     </q> On the other ſide, without any ſuch Rhetoricall outcries, I ſimply affirme: It is a reproach, a ſcandall, a crime of rebellion, for a ſubiect hauing his full charge and loade of benefits, in the new ſpring of his Kings tender aage, his King-fathers blood yet reeking, and vpon the point of an addreſſe for a double match with Spaine; in ſo honourable an aſſembly, to ſeeke the thraldome of his Kings Crowne, to play the captious in cauilling about cauſes of his Kings depoſing, to giue his former life the Lye with ſhame enough in his old aage, and to make himſelfe a common by-word, vnder the name of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blematicall Martyr;</hi> one that offers himſelfe to fagot and fire, for a point of doctrine but problematically handled, that is, diſtruſtfully and onely by way of doubtfull and queſtionable diſcourſe: yea for a point of doctrine, in which the French (as he pretendeth) are permitted to thwart and croſſe his Holines in iudgement, prouided they ſpeake in it as in a point, not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and neceſſary, but onely doubtfull and probable.</p>

<note place="margin">Pag. 87.</note> Cardinall to grow by admitting this Article of the third Eſtate, is flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed <q>in theſe colours: <hi>It would breed and bring foorth an open and vnauoydeable ſchiſme against his Holineſſe, and the rest of the whole Eccleſiasticall body: For thereby the doctrine long approued and ratified by the Pope and the rest of the Church, ſhould now be taxed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of impious and moſt detestable conſequence; yea the Pope and the Church, euen in faith and in points of ſaluation, ſhould be reputed and beleeued to be erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly perſwaded.</hi>
                     </q> Hereupon his Lordſhip giues himſelfe a large ſcope of the raines, to frame his elegant amplifications againſt ſchiſmes and ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes.</p>
                  <p>Now to mount ſo high, and to flie in ſuch place vpon the wings of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification for this Inconuenience, what is it elſe but magnifically to report and imagine a miſchiefe by many degrees greater then the miſchiefe is? The L. Cardinal is in a great errour, if hee make himſelfe beleeue, that other nations wil make a rent or ſeparation from the communion of the French, becauſe the French ſtand to it tooth and naile, that French Crownes are not liable or obnoxious to Papall depoſition; howſoeuer there is no ſchiſme that importeth not ſeparation of communion. The moſt illuſtrious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike of <hi>Venice,</hi> hath imbarked herſelfe in this quarrell againſt his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hath played her prize, and caried away the weapons with great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Doeth ſhe, notwithſtanding her triumph in the cauſe, forbeare to participate with all her neighbours in the ſame Sacraments? doeth ſhe liue in ſchiſme with all the reſt of the Romane Church? No ſuch matter. When the L. Cardinal himſelfe not many yeeres paſt, maintained the Kings cauſe, and ſtood honourably for the Kings right againſt the Popes Temporall vſurpations, did he then take other Churches to be ſchiſmaticall, or the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten members of <hi>Antichrist?</hi> Beleeue it who liſt, I beleeue my Creed. Nay, his Lordſhip telleth vs himſelfe a little after, that his Holineſſe giues the French free ſcope, to maintaine either the affirmatiue or negatiue of this queſtion. And will his Holineſſe hold them ſchiſmatikes, that diſſent from his opinion and iudgement in a ſubiect or cauſe eſteemed proble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall? Farre be it from his Holineſſe. The King of Spaine, reputed the Popes right arme, neuer gaue the Pope cauſe by any acte or other decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, to conceiue that he acknowledged himſelfe depoſeable by the Pope for hereſie, or Tyrannie, or ſtupiditie. But being well aſſured the Pope ſtandeth in greater feare of his arme, then hee doeth of the Popes head and
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:23110:248"/>ſhoulders, he neuer troubles his owne head about our queſtion. More, when the booke of Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi> was come foorth, in which booke the Kingdome of Naples is deſcried and publiquely diſcredited (like falſe money) touching the qualitie of a Kingdome, and attributed to the King of Spaine, not as trew proprietary thereof, but onely as an Eſtate held in fee of the Romane Church; the King made no bones to condemne and to baniſh the ſaid booke out of his dominions. The holy Father was conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to put vp his Catholike ſonnes proceeding to the Cardinals diſgrace, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer opened his mouth againſt the King, neuer declared or noted the King to be ſchiſmaticall. He waits perhaps for ſome fitter opportunitie; when the Kingdome of Spaine groaning vnder the burthens of inteſtine diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and troubles, hee may without any danger to himſelfe giue the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike King a Biſhops mate. Yea, the L. Cardinal himſelfe is better ſeene in the humors and inclinations of the Chriſtian world, then to be groſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that in the Kingdome of Spaine, and in the very heart of Rome it ſelfe there be not many, which either make it but a ieaſt, or elſe take it in fowle ſcorne, to heare the Popes power ouer the Crownes of Kings once named: eſpecially ſince the Venetian Republike hath put his Holineſſe to the worſe in the ſame cauſe, and caſt him in Law.</p>
                  <p>What needed the L. Cardinall then, by caſting vp ſuch mounts and trenches, by heaping one amplification vpon an other, to make ſchiſme looke with ſuch a terrible and hideous aſpect? Who knowes not how great an offence, how heinous a crime it is to quarter not IESVS CHRISTS coat, but his body, which is the Church? And what needed ſuch terrifying of the Church with vglineſſe of ſchiſme, whereof there is neither colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhew, nor poſſibilitie?</p>
                  <p>The next vgly monſter, after ſchiſme, ſhaped by the L. Cardinall in the third ſuppoſed and pretended inconuenience, is hereſie.
<note place="margin">Pag. 89.</note> His Lordſhip <q>ſaith for the purpoſe: <hi>By this Article we are cast headlong into a manifest hereſie, as binding vs to confeſſe, that for many aages paſt, the Catholike Church hath bene baniſhed out of the whole world. For if the champions of the doctrine contrary to this Article, doe hold an impious and a detestable opinion, repugnant vnto Gods word, then doubtleſſe the Pope for ſo many hundred yeeres expired, hath not bene the head of the Church, but an heretike and the Antichrist.</hi> He addeth moreouer; <hi>That the Church long agoe hath lost her name of Catholike, and that in France there hath no Church flouriſhed, nor ſo much as appeared theſe many and more then many yeeres: for as much as all the French doctors for many yeres together, haue ſtood for the contrary opinion. We can erect and ſet vp no trophey more honorable for heretikes in token of their victory, then to auow that Chriſts viſible Kingdom is periſhed from the face of the earth, and that for ſo many hundred yeres there hath not bene any Temple of God, nor any ſpouſe of Chriſt, but euery where, and all the world ouer, the kingdom of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, the ſynagogue of Satan, the ſpouſe of the diuel, hath mightily preuailed and borne all the ſway. Laſtly, what ſtronger engines can theſe heretikes wiſh or deſire, for the battering and the demoliſhing of tranſubſtantiation, of auricular confeſsion, and other
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:23110:249"/>like towers of our Catholike Religion, then if it ſhould bee granted the Church hath decided the ſaid points without any authoritie? &amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mee thinkes the L. Cardinal in the whole draught and courſe of theſe words doeth ſeeke not a little to blemiſh the honour of his Church, and to marke his religion with a blacke coale: For the whole frame of his Mother-Church is very eaſie to be ſhaken, if by the eſtabliſhing of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle ſhe ſhall come to finall ruine, and ſhall become the Synagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Likewiſe, Kings are brought into a very miſerable ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if their Souereigntie ſhall not ſtand, if they ſhall not bee without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of depoſition, but by the totall ruine of the Church, and by holding the Pope, whom they ſerue, to be Antichriſt. The L. Cardinall himſelfe (let him be well ſifted) herein doeth not credit his owne words: For doeth not his Lordſhip tell vs plaine, that neither by Diuine teſtimony, nor by any ſentence of the ancient Church, the knot of this controuerſie hath bene vntied? againe, that ſome of the French, by the Popes fauourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, are licenſed or tolerated to ſay their mind, to deliuer their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this queſtion, though contrary to the iudgement of his Holineſſe; prouided they hold it onely as problematicall, and not as neceſſary? What? Can there be any aſſurance for the Pope, that hee is not Antichriſt; for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſhe is not a Synagogue of Satan, when a mans aſſurance is grounded vpon wauering and wilde vncertainties, without Canon of Scripture, without conſent or countenance of antiquitie, and in a cauſe which the Pope by good leaue ſuffereth ſome to toſſe with winds of problematicall opinion? It hath beene ſhewed before, that by Gods word, whereof ſmall reckoning perhaps is made, by venerable anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and by the French Church in thoſe times when the Popes power was mounted aloft, the doctrine which teacheth depoſing of Kings by the Pope, hath bene checked and countermanded. What, did the French in thoſe dayes beleeue the Church was then ſwallowed vp, and no where viſible or extant in the world? No verely; Thoſe that make the Pope of Soueraigne authoritie for matters of Faith, are not perſwaded that in this cauſe they are bound abſolutely to beleeue and credit his doctrine. Why ſo? Becauſe they take it not for any decree or determination of Faith; but for a point perteining to the myſteries of State, and a pillar of the Popes Temporall Monarchie; who hath not receiued any promiſe from God, that in cauſes of this nature hee ſhall not erre: For they hold, that errour by no meanes can crawle or ſcramble vp to the Papall See, ſo highly moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but grant ambition can ſcale the higheſt walls, and climbe the loftieſt pinacles of the ſame See. They hold withall, that in caſe of ſo ſpeciall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage to the Pope, whereby he is made King of Kings, and as it were the pay-maſter or diſtributer of Crownes, it is againſt all reaſon that hee ſhould ſit as Iudge, to carue out Kingdomes for his owne ſhare. To bee ſhort, let his Lordſhip be aſſured that he meeteth with notorious blocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, more blunt-witted then a whetſtone, when they are drawen to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:23110:249"/>by his perſwaſion, that whoſoeuer beleeues the Pope hath no right nor power to put Kings beſide their Thrones, to giue and take away Crownes, are all excluded and barred out of the heauenly Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>But now followes a worſe matter: For they whom the Cardinall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully calls heretikes, haue wrought and wonne his Lordſhip (as to mee ſeemeth) to plead their cauſe at the barre, and to betray his owne cauſe to theſe heretikes: For what is it in his Lordſhip, but plaine playing the Praeuaricator, when he crieth ſo lowd, that by admitting and eſtabliſhing of this Article, the doctrine of Cake-incarnation and priuie Confeſſion to a Prieſt, is vtterly ſubuerted? Let vs heare his reaſon, and willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the trewth from his lips. The Articles (as his Lordſhip granteth) of Tranſubſtantiation, auricular Confeſſion, and the Popes power to depoſe Kings, are all grounded alike vpon the ſame authoritie. Now he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Article of the Popes power to depoſe Kings, is not deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Scripture, nor by the ancient Church, but within the compaſſe of certaine aages paſt, by the authoritie of Popes and Councils. Then he goes on well, and inferres with good reaſon, that in caſe the point of the Popes power be weakened, then the other two points muſt needs bee ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and eaſily ouerthrowen: So that hee doeth confeſſe the monſtrous birth of the breaden-God, and the blind Sacrament or vaine fantaſie of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular confeſſion, are no more conueyed into the Church by pipes from the ſprings of ſacred Scripture, or from the riuers of the ancient Church, then that other point of the Popes power ouer Kings and their Crownes. Very good: For were they indeed deriued from either of thoſe two heads, that is to ſay, were they grounded vpon the foundation of the firſt or ſecond authoritie; then they could neuer bee ſhaken by the downefall of the Popes power to depoſe Kings. I am well aſſured, that for vſing ſo good a reaſon, the world will hold his Lordſhip in ſuſpicion, that he ſtill hath ſomeſmacke of his fathers diſcipline and inſtruction, who in times paſt had the honour to be a Miniſter of the holy Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit he playeth not faire, nor vſeth ſincere dealing in his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt ſuch as he calls heretikes; when hee caſts in their diſh, and beares them in hand they frowardly wrangle for the inuiſibilitie of the Church in earth: For indeed the matter is nothing ſo. They freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a viſible Church: For howſoeuer the aſſembly of Gods elect, doth make a body not diſcerneable by mans eye; yet we aſſuredly beleeue, and gladly profeſſe, there neuer wanted a viſible Church in the world; yet onely viſible to ſuch as make a part of the ſame. All that are without, ſee no more but men, they doe not ſee the ſaid men to be the trew Church. Wee beleeue moreouer of the vniuerſall Church viſible, that it is compoſed of many particular Churches, whereof ſome are better fined and more cleane from lees and dregs then other: and withall, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the pureſt Churches to be alwayes the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt viſible.</p>

Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the latter of which two Kings, his Lordſhip ſaith in a ſtraine of boaſting, after this manner: <hi>I, by the grace of God, or the grace of God by mee rather, reduced him to the Catholike religion. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at Rome his abſolution of Pope Clement</hi> 8. <hi>I reconciled him to the holy See.</hi> Touching the firſt of theſe points; I ſay the time, the occaſions, and the foreſaid Kings neceſſary affaires doe ſufficiently teſtifie, that he was indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to change his mind, and to alter his religion, vpon the ſtrength of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of arguments then Theologicall ſchooles, or the perſwaſions of the L. Cardinals fluent Rhetoricke, doe vſually afford, or could poſſibly ſuggeſt. Moreouer, who doeth not know, that in affaires of ſo high na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and conſequence, reſolutions once taken, Princes are to proceede with inſtructions by a formall courſe? As for the Kings abſolution, pretended to bee purchaſed of <hi>Clement</hi> 8. by the L. Cardinals good ſeruice; it had beene the part of ſo great a Cardinall, for the honour of his King, of the Realme, and of his owne place, to haue buried that piece of his notable ſeruice in perpetuall ſilence, and in the darke night of eternall obliuion: For in this matter of reconcilement, it is not vnknowne to the world, how ſhamefully and baſely hee proſtituted the inuiolable dignity of his King, when his Lordſhip repreſenting the perſon of his King, and couching on the ground by way of ſufficient penance, was glad (as I haue noted in the Preface to my Apologie) to haue his venerable ſhoulders gracefully ſaluted with ſtripes, and reuerently worſhipped with baſtonados of a Pontificiall cudgell. Which gracefull, or diſgracefull blemiſh rather, it pleaſed Pope <hi>Clement</hi> of his rare clemencie, to grace yet with a higher degree of ſpirituall graces; in giuing the L. Cardinall then Biſhop of <hi>Eureux,</hi> a certaine quantity of holy graines, croſſes, and medals, or little plates of ſiluer, or ſome other mettall, to hang about the necke, or to bee borne about againſt ſome euill: Which treaſures of the Popes grace, whoſoeuer ſhould graciouſly and reuerently kiſſe, they ſhould without faile purchaſe vnto themſelues a pardon for one hundred yeeres. Theſe feate and prety gugawes for children, were no doubt a ſpeciall comfort vnto the good Kings heart, after his Maieſtie had beene handſomely baſted vpon the L. Biſhops backe. But with what face can his Lordſhip brag, that he preuailed with Pope <hi>Clement</hi> for the Kings abſolution? The late Duke of <hi>Neuers,</hi> not long before had ſolicited his
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:23110:250"/>Holines, with all earneſt and humble inſtance to the ſame purpoſe; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, the Kings affaires then ſeeming deſperate in the Popes eye, he was licenſed to depart for <hi>France,</hi> without any due and gracious reſpect vnto his errand. But ſo ſoone as the Pope receiued intelligence, of the Kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes growing to the full, and the affaires of the League to be in the wane, and the principall cities, the ſtrongeſt places of garriſon through all <hi>France</hi> to ſtrike tops and tops gallant, and to hale the King; then the holy Ghoſt in good time inſpired the holy Father with a holy deſire and tender affection, to receiue this poore wandring ſheep againe into the flocke of Chriſt, and boſome of holy Church. His Holineſſe had reaſon: For he feared by his obſtinate ſeuerity to prouoke the patience of the French, and to driue that Nation (as they had many times threatned before) then to put in execution their auncient deſigne; which was, to ſhake off the Pope, and to ſet vp ſome of their owne tribes or kinreds for Patriarch ouer the French Church. But let his Lordſhippe vouchſafe to ſearch the ſecret of his owne boſome, and no doubt he wil not ſticke to acknowledge, that before he ſtirred one foote out of <hi>France,</hi> he had good aſſurance of the good ſucceſſe and iſſue of his honourable embaſſage.</p>
                  <p>Now the hearers thus prepared by his Preface, the L. Cardinall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in his purpoſe; namely to make proofe, how this Article of the third Eſtate, wherein doubtfull and queſtionable matters are mingled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with certaine and indubitable principles, doth ſo debilitate and weaken the ſinewes and vertue of any remedy intended for the danger of Kings, as it maketh all remedies and receipts preſcribed for that purpoſe, to become altogether vnprofitable, and without effect. He yeelds this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, (take it forſooth vpon my warrant) a reaſon full of pith and ſubſtance: The onely remedie againſt parricides, is to thunder the ſolemne curſes of the Church, and the puniſhments to be inflicted after death: which points, if they be not grounded vpon infallible authoritie, will neuer be ſetled in mens perſwaſions with any certaine aſſurance. Now in the ſolemne cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Church, no man can attaine to the ſaid aſſurance, if things not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied be mingled with points not graunted, and not conſented vnto by the Vniuerſall Church. By a thing not denied and not conteſted, the L. Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall meanes prohibiting and condemning of King-killing: and by points conteſted, he meanes denying of the Popes power to depoſe Kings.</p>
                  <p>In this whole diſcourſe, I find neither pith of argument, nor courſe of proofe; but onely a caſt of the L. Cardinalls office by way of counſell: whereunto I make this anſwere. If there be in this Article of the third E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate any point, wherein all are not of one mind and the ſame iudgement; in whom lieth all the blame, from whence riſes the doubt, but from the Popes and Popiſh paraſites, by whom the certaintie of the ſaid point hath bin cunningly remooued and conueied away, and muſt be reſtored againe by publike authority? Now the way to reſtore certainty vnto a point, which againſt reaſon is called into doubt and queſtion, is to make it vp in one
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:23110:251"/>maſſe, or to tie it vp in the ſame bundle, with other certaine points of the ſame nature.</p>
                  <p>Here I am forced to ſummon the conſciences of men, to make ſome ſtand or ſtay vpon this point, and with me to enter into deepe conſideration, how great and vnuanquiſhable force is euer found in the trewth: For theſe two queſtions, Whether Kings may lawfully be made away by aſſaſſins waged and hired for the act; and Whether the Pope hath lawfull power to chaſe Kings out of their Thrones, are by the L. Cardinals owne confeſſion, in ſo full aſpect of coniunction, that if either bee brought vnder any degree of doubt, the other alſo is fetcht within the ſame compaſſe. In which words he directly pointeth as with a finger to the very trew ſource of the maine miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, and to the baſilique and liuer veine, infected with peſtilential blood, inflamed to the deſtruction of Baſilicall Princes by deteſtable parricide: For whoſoeuer ſhall confidently beleeue that Popes are not armed with power to depoſe Kings; will beleeue with no leſſe confidence and aſſurance, it is not lawful by ſudden aſſaults to flie at their throats. For are not all deſperate villaines perſwaded, when they are hired to murder Kings, that in doing ſo damnable a feate, they doe it for a piece of notable and extraordinary ſeruice to the Pope? This maxime therfore is to be held for a principle vnmoouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and indubitable; that, If ſubiects deſire the life of their Kings to bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; they muſt not yeeld the Pope one inch of power, to depriue their Kings of their Thrones and Crownes, by depoſing their Kings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Lord Cardinall teſtifieth no leſſe himſelfe in theſe words: <hi>If thoſe monſters of men, and furies of hell, by whom the life-blood of our two laſt Kings was let out, had euer beene acquainted with Lawes Eccleſiaſticall, they might haue read themſelues adiudged by the Councill of Conſtance to expreſſe damnation.</hi>
                     </q> For in theſe words, the L. Cardinall preferreth a bill of inditement to caſt his Holineſſe; who, vpon the commencing of the Leaguers warres, in ſtead of giuing order for the publiſhing of the ſaid Eccleſiaſticall Lawes for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining of all parricidicall practiſes and attempts, fell to the terrour of his fulminations, which not long after were ſeconded and ratified by the moſt audatious and bloody murder of King <hi>Henry</hi> III. In like manner, the whole Clergy of <hi>France</hi> are wrapped vp by the L. Cardinals words, and inuolued in the perill of the ſaid inditement: For in ſtead of preaching the ſaid Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Lawes, by which all King-killing is inhibited; the Prieſts taught, vented, and publiſhed nothing but rebellion; and when the people in great deuotion came to powre their confeſſions into the Prieſts eares; then the Prieſts, with a kind of counterbuffe in the ſecond place when their turne was come, and with greater deuotion, powred blood into the eares of the people; out of which roote grewe the terrour of thoſe cruell warres, and the horrible parricide of that good King.</p>
                  <p>But let vs here take ſome neere ſight of theſe Eccleſiaſticall Lawes, whereby ſubiects are inhibited to kill, or deſperately to diſpatch their Kings out of the way. The Lord Cardinall, for full payment of all ſcores
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:23110:251"/>vpon this reckoning, layeth downe the credit of the Councill at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which neuertheleſſe affoardeth not one myte of trew and currant pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The trewth of the hiſtory may bee taken from this briefe relation. <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Burgundy, procured <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of Orleans to be murthered in Paris: To iuſtifie and make good this bloody acte, he produced a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine petimaſter, one called by the name of <hi>Iohn Petit.</hi> This little <hi>Iohn</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed nine propoſitions to be giuen foorth or ſet vp, to bee diſcuſſed in the famous Vniuerſitie of Paris: The ſumme of all to this purpoſe; It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, iuſt, and honourable, for euery ſubiect or priuate perſon either by open force and violence, or by deceit and ſecret lying in waite, or by ſome wittie ſtratagem, or by any other way of fact, to kil a Tyrant practiſing againſt his King, and other higher powers; yea the King ought in reaſon, to giue him a penſion or ſtipend, that hath killed any perſon diſloyal to his Prince. The words of <hi>Petits</hi> firſt propoſition be theſe: <hi>It is lawfull for euery ſubiect,
<note place="margin">Gerſon.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any command or commiſsion from the higher powers by all the Lawes of nature, of man, and of God himſelfe, to kill or cauſe to be killed any Tyrant, who either by a couetous and greedie deſire, or by fraud, by diuination vpon casting of Lots, by double and treacherous dealing, doeth plot or practiſe against his Kings corporall health, or the health of his higher powers.</hi> In the third propoſition: <hi>It is lawfull for euery ſubiect honourable and meritorious, to kill the ſaid Tyrant, or cauſe him to be killed as a Traitor, diſloyall and trecherous to his King.</hi> In the ſixt propoſition: <hi>The King is to appoint a ſalarie and recompence for him that hath killed ſuch a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or hath cauſed him to bee killed.</hi> Theſe propoſitions of <hi>Iohannes Paruus,</hi> were condemned by the Councill of Conſtance, as impious, and tending to the ſcandall of the Church. Now then, whereas the ſaid Councill no doubt vnderſtood the name or word Tyrant in the ſame ſenſe, wherein it was taken by <hi>Iohannes Paruus;</hi> certaine it is, the Councill was not of any ſuch iudgement or mind, to condemne one that ſhould kill a King or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Prince; but one that by treaſon, and without commandement ſhould kill a ſubiect, rebelling and practiſing againſt his King. For <hi>Iohn Petit</hi> had vndertaken to iuſtifie the making away of the Duke of Orleans to be a lawfull acte, and calls that Dukea Tyrant, albeit hee was no Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Prince; as all the aboue recited words of <hi>Iohn Petit</hi> doe teſtifie, that he ſpeaketh of ſuch a Tyrant, as being in ſtate of ſubiection, rebelleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his free and abſolute Prince: So that whoſoeuer ſhall narrowly ſearch and looke into the mind and meaning of the ſaid Council, ſhal eaſily perceiue, that by their decrees the ſafetie of Kings was not confirmed but weakened, not augmented but diminiſhed; for as much as they inhibited priuate perſons to kill a Subiect, attempting by wicked counſels and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes to make away his King.</p>
                  <p>But be it granted, the Councill of Conſtance is flat and altogether direct againſt King-killers; For I am not vnwilling to be perſwaded, that had the queſtion then touched the murdering of Soueraigne Princes, the ſaid Councill would haue paſſed a ſound and holy decree: But, I ſay, this gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:23110:252"/>what ſheild of defence is hereby reached to Kings, to ward or beat off the thruſt of a murderers weapon, and to ſaue or ſecure their life? ſeeing the L. Cardinall, building vpon the ſubtile deuiſe and ſhift of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> hath taught vs out of their Schooles, that by Kings are vnderſtood Kings in <hi>eſſe,</hi> not yet fallen from the ſupreame degree of Soueraigne Royaltie: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once depoſed by the Pope, (ſay the <hi>Ieſuites</hi>) they are no longer Kings, but are fallen from the rights of Soueraigne dignitie; and conſequently to make ſtrip and waſt of their blood, is not forſooth to make ſtrip and waſt of Royall blood. The <hi>Ieſuiticall</hi> maſters, in the file of their words are ſo ſupple and ſo limber, that by leauing ſtill in their ſpeech ſome ſtarting hole or other, they are able by the ſame, as by a poſterne or backdoore, to make an eſcape.</p>
                  <p>Meane while the Readers are here to note (for well they may) a tricke of monſtrous and moſt wicked cunning. The L. Cardinall contends for the bridling and hampering of King-killers by the Lawes Eccleſiaſticall. Now it might be preſumed, that ſo reuerend and learned a Cardinal inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to make vſe of Eccleſiaſticall Lawes, by vertue whereof the life of Kings may be ſecured, would fill his mouth and garniſh the point with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Oracles, that wee might the more gladly and willingly giue him the hearing, when hee ſpeakes as one furniſhed with ſufficient weight and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of ſacred Scripture. But behold, in ſtead of the authenticall and moſt ancient word, hee propounds the decree of a lateborne Councill at Conſtance, neither for the Popes tooth, nor any way comming neere the point in controuerſie. And ſuppoſe it were pertinent vnto the purpoſe, the L. Cardinall beareth in his hand a forke of diſtinction, with two tines or teeth to beare off, nay to ſhift off and to auoid the matter with meere dalliance. The ſhorteſt and neereſt way (in ſome ſort of reſpects) to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a falſe opinion, is to charge or ſet vpon it with falſe and with ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous reaſons. The like way to worke the ouerthrow of trew doctrine, is to reſt or ground it vpon friuolous reaſons or authorities of ſtubble-weight. For example; if we ſhould thus argue for the immortalitie of the ſoule with <hi>Plato:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Phaedone.</note> The ſwan ſingeth before her death; <hi>ergo,</hi> the ſoule is immortall. Or thus with certaine ſeduced Chriſtians: The Pope hath ordained the word of God to be authenticall: <hi>ergo,</hi> all credit muſt be giuen to diuine Scripture. Vpon the ſpurkies or hookes of ſuch ridiculous arguments and friuolous reaſons, the L. Cardinall hangs the life and ſafetie of Kings.</p>
                  <p>With like artificiall deuiſes hee pretendeth to haue the infamous mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and appoſted cutting of Kings throats in extreame deteſtation; and yet by depoſing them from their Princely dignities, by degrading them from their ſupreame and Soueraigne authorities, hee brings their ſacred heads to the butchers blocke: For a King depoſed by the Pope, (let no man doubt) will not leaue any ſtone vnremooued, nor any meanes and wayes vnattempted, nor any forces or powers of men vnleuied or vnhired, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelfe and his Regall dignitie, to repreſſe and bring vnder his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:23110:252"/>people, by the Pope diſcharged of their alleagiance. In this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie of the publike affaires, in theſe tempeſtuous perturbations of the State, with what perils is the King not beſieged and aſſaulted? His head is expoſed to the chances of warre; his life a faire marke to the inſidious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes of a thouſand traitours; his Royall perſon obuious to the dreadfull ſtorme of angry fortune, to the deadly malice, to the fatall and mortall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of his enemies. The reaſon: He is preſuppoſed to be lawfully and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly ſtripped of his Kingdome. Wil he yet hold the ſterne of his Royall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate? Then is he neceſſarily taken for a Tyrant, reputed an vſurper, and his life is expoſed to the ſpoile: For the publike lawes make it lawful and free, for any priuate perſon to enterpriſe againſt an vſurper of the Kingdome: <hi>Euery man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian, is a ſouldier,

Such therefore as pretend ſo much pity towards Kings, to abhorre the bloody opening of their liuer-veine, and yet withall, to approoue their hoyſting out of the Royall dignity, are iuſt in the veine and humour of thoſe that ſay, Let vs not kill the King, but let vs diſarme the King that he may die a violent death: let vs not depriue him of life, but of the meanes to defend his life: let vs not ſtrangle the King and ſtop his vitall breath, ſo long as he remaineth King; O that were impious, O that were horrible and abominable; but let him be depoſed, and then whoſoeuer ſhall runne him through the body with a weapon vp to the very hilts, ſhall not beare the guilt of a King-killer. All this muſt be vnderſtood to be ſpoken of Kings, who after they are deſpoiled of Regalitie, by ſentence of depoſition giuen by the Pope, are able to arme themſelues, and by valiant armes doe defend their Soueraigne rights. But in caſe the King, blaſted with Romane lightning, and ſtricken with Papall thunder, ſhall actually and ſpeedily bee ſmitten downe from his high Throne of Regality, with preſent loſſe of his Kingdome; I beleeue it is almoſt impoſſible for him to warrant his owne life, who was not able to warrant his owne Kingdome. Let a cat be throwen from a high roofe to the bottome of a cellour or vault, ſhe lighteth on her feet, and runneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without taking any harme. A King is not like a cat, howſoeuer a cat may looke vpon a King: he cannot fall from the loftie pinacle of Royalty, to light on his feet vpon the hard pauement of a priuate ſtate, without cruſhing all his bones in pieces. It hath bene the lot of very few Emperors and Kings, to outliue their Empire: For men aſcend to the loftie Throne of Kings, with a ſoft and eaſie pace, by certaine ſteps and degrees; there be no ſtately ſtaires to come downe, they tumble head and heeles together when they fall. He that hath once griped anothers Kingdome, thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:23110:253"/>in little ſafetie, ſo long as he ſhall of his courteſie ſuffer his diſſeiſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſour to draw his breath. And ſay that ſome Princes, after their fall from their Thrones, haue eſcaped both point and edge of the Tyrants wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon; yet haue they wandred like miſerable fugitiues in forreine countreys, or elſe haue bene condemned like captiues to perpetuall impriſonment at home, a thouſand-fold worſe and more lamentable then death it ſelfe. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius</hi> the Tyrant of <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> from a great King in <hi>Sicilie</hi> tur'nd Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter in <hi>Corinth.</hi> It was the onely calling and kind of life, that as he thought bearing ſome reſemblance of rule and gouernment, might recreate his mind, as an image or picture of his former Soueraigntie ouer men. This <hi>Dionyſius</hi> was the onely man (to my knowledge) that had a humour to laugh after the loſſe of a Kingdome, and in the ſtate of a Pedant or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of children, merily to ieaſt and to ſcorne his former ſtate and condition of a King. In this my Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> ſundry Kings haue ſeene the walls as it were of their Princely fortreſſe diſmantled, razed, and beaten downe. By name, <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard,</hi> both II. and <hi>Henrie</hi> the VI. all which Kings were moſt cruelly murdered in priſon. In the reigne of <hi>Edward</hi> III. by Acte of Parliament, <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall imagine,</hi> (that is the very word of the Statute) <hi>or machinate the Kings death, are declared guiltie of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and high Treaſon.</hi> The learned Iudges of the Land, grounding vpon this Law of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, haue euer ſince reputed and iudged them traitors according to Law, that haue dared onely to whiſper or talke ſoftly betweene the teeth, of depoſing the King: For they count it a cleare caſe, that no Crowne can be taken from a Kings head, without loſſe of Head and Crowne together, ſooner or later.</p>
                  <p>The L. Cardinal therefore in this moſt weightie and ſerious point doth meerely dally and flowt after a ſort,
<note place="margin">Page 95.</note> when hee tells vs, <hi>The Church doeth not intermeddle with releaſing of ſubiects, and knocking off their yrons of obedience, but onely before the Eccleſiasticall tribunall ſeat; and that beſides this double cenſure, of abſolution to ſubiects, and excommunication to the Prince, the Church impoſeth none other penaltie. Vnder pretence of which two cenſures, ſo farre is the Church</hi> (as the L. Cardinall pretendeth) <hi>from conſenting that any man ſo cenſured ſhould bee tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched for his life, that ſhe vtterly abborreth all murder whatſoeuer; but eſpecially all ſudden and vnprepenced murders for feare of caſting away both body and ſoule; which often in ſudden murders goe both one way.</hi> It hath bene made manifeſt before, that all ſuch proſcription and ſetting forth of Kings to port-ſale, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies for the traine thereof, either ſome violent and bloody death, or ſome other miſchiefe more intolerable then death it ſelfe. What are we the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that parricides of Kings are neither ſet on, nor approued by the Church in their abominable actions; when ſhee layeth ſuch plots, and taketh ſuch courſes, as neceſſarily doe inferre the cutting of their throates? In the next place be it noted, that his Lordſhip againſt all reaſon, reckons the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing of ſubiects from the oath of alleagiance, in the ranke of penalties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded and enioyned before the Eccleſiaſticall tribunall ſeate: For this
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:23110:253"/>penaltie is not Eccleſiaſticall, but Ciuill, and conſequently not triable in Eccleſiaſticall Courts, without vſurping vpon the Ciuill Magiſtrate. But I wonder with what face the L. Cardinall can ſay, The Church neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth to any practiſe againſt his life, whom ſhe hath once chaſtiſed with ſeuere cenſures: For can his Lordſhip be ignorant, what is written by Pope <hi>Vrbanus, Can.

And when hee ſaw two great Kings murdered one after another, wherefore by ſome publike declaration did not his Holineſſe teſtifie to all Chriſtendome, his inward ſenſe and trew apprehenſion of ſo great misfortune, as all <hi>Europe</hi> had iuſt cauſe to lament on the behalfe of <hi>France?</hi> Wherefore did not his Holineſſe publiſh ſome Law or Pontificiall Decree, to prouide for the ſecuritie of Kings in time to come? Trew it is, that he cenſured <hi>Becanus</hi> his booke: But wherefore? That by a captious and ſleight cenſure, he might preuent a more exact and rigorous Decree of the <hi>Sorbone</hi> Schoole: For the Popes checke to <hi>Becanus,</hi> was onely agenerall cenſure and touch, without any particular ſpecification of matter touching the life of Kings. About ſome two moneths after, the ſaid booke was printed againe, with a dedication to the Popes <hi>Nuntio</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> yet without any alteration, ſaue onely of two articles conteining the abſolute power of the people ouer Kings. In recompence and for a counterchecke whereof, three or foure articles were inſerted into the ſaid booke, touching the Popes power ouer Kings; arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles no leſſe wicked &amp; iniurious to Regall rights; nay more iniurious then any of the other clauſes, whereof iuſt cauſe of exception and complaint had bene giuen before. If I would collect and heape vp examples of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Emperours, (as of <hi>Henrie</hi> IV. whoſe dead corps felt the rage and furie of the Pope; or of <hi>Frederic</hi> II. againſt whom the Pope was not aſhamed to whet and kindle the Sultane; or of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> our Predeceſſour, of glorious memorie, whoſe life was diuers times aſſaulted by priuie mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, expreſly diſpatched from <hi>Rome</hi> for that holy ſeruice) if I would gather vp other examples of the ſame ſtampe, which I haue layd forth in my Apologie for the oath of alleagiance; I could make it more cleare then day-light, how farre the L. Cardinals words are diſcrepant from the trewth, where his Lordſhip out of moſt rare conſidence is bold to auow,
<note place="margin">Page 97.</note> 
                     <hi>That neuer
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:23110:254"/>any Pope went ſo farre, as to giue conſent or counſell for the desperate murdering of Princes.</hi> That which already hath bene alleadged may ſuffice to conuince his Lordſhip: I meane, that his Holineſſe by depoſing of Kings, doeth lead them directly to their graues and tombes.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinall himſelfe ſeemeth to take ſome notice hereof. <hi>The Church</hi> (as he ſpeaketh) <hi>abhorreth ſudden and vnprepenſed murders aboue therest.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 95.</note> Doth not his Lordſhip in this phraſe of ſpeech acknowledge, that murders com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by open force, are not ſo much diſauowed or diſclaimed by the Church? A little after he ſpeakes not in the teeth, as before, but with full and open mouth; that hee doeth not diſlike a King once depoſed by the Pope, ſhould be purſued with open warre: Whereupon it followes, that in warre the King may be lawfully ſlaine. No doubt a remarkeable degree of his Lordſhips clemencie. A King ſhall bee better entreated and more mildly dealt withal, if he be ſlaine by the ſhot of an harquebuſe or caleeuer in the field, then if hee bee ſtabd by the ſtroke or thruſt of a knife in his chamber: or if at a ſiege of ſome city hee be blowne vp with a myne, then by a myne made, and a traine of gunpowder laid vnder his Palace or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament houſe in time of peace. His reaſon: Forſooth, becauſe in ſudden murders, oftentimes the ſoule and the body periſh both together. O ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar bountie, and rare clemencie! prouokers, inſtigators, ſtrong puffers and blowers of parricides, in mercifull compaſſion of the ſoule, become vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull and ſhamefull murderers of the body. This deuice may well claime and challenge kinred of <hi>Mariana</hi> the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> inuention: For he liketh not at any hand the poiſoning of a Tyrant by his meat or drinke; for feare leſt he taking the poiſon with his owne hand, and ſwallowing or gulping it downe in his meate or drinke ſo taken, ſhould be found <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> (as the common Lawyer ſpeaketh) or culpable of his owne death. But <hi>Mariana</hi> likes better, to haue a Tyrant poyſoned by his chaire, or by his apparell and robes, after the example of the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> Kings; that being ſo poyſoned onely by ſent, or by contact, he may not be found guiltie of ſelfe-fellonie, and the ſoule of the poore Tyrant in her flight out of the body may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. O hel-hounds, O diabolical wretches, O infernall monſters! Did they onely ſuſpect and imagine, that either in Kings there is any remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Kingly courage, or in their ſubiects any ſparke left of ancient liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; they durſt as ſoone eat their nailes, or teare their owne fleſh from the bones, as once broach the veſſell of this diabolicall deuice. How long then, how long ſhall Kings whom the Lord hath called his Anointed, Kings the breathing Images of God vpon earth; Kings that with a wry or frowning looke, are able to cruſh theſe earth-wormes in pieces; how long ſhall they ſuffer this viperous brood, ſcotfree and without puniſhment, to ſpit in their faces? how long, the Maieſtie of GOD in their perſon and Royall Maieſtie, to be ſo notoriouſly vilified, ſo diſhonourably trampled vnder foot?</p>
                  <p>The L. Cardinall borads vs with a like manifeſt ieaſt, and notably trifles;
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:23110:254"/>firſt, diſtinguiſhing betweene Tyrants by adminiſtration, and Tyrants by vſurpation; then ſhewing that he by no meanes doeth approue thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and heatheniſh Lawes, whereby ſecret practiſes and conſpiracies <q>againſt a Tyrant by adminiſtration are permitted. His reaſon; <hi>Becauſe after depoſition there is a certaine habitude to Royall dignitie, and as it were a kinde of politicke Character inherent in Kings, by which they are diſcerned from perſons meerely priuate, or the common ſort of people; and the obstacle, croſſe-barre, or ſparre once remooued and taken out of the way, the ſaid Kings depoſed are at length reinueſted and endowed againe with lawfull vſe of Royall dignitie, and with law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full adminiſtration of the Kingdome.</hi>
                     </q> Is it poſſible that his Lordſhip can ſpeake and vtter theſe words according to the inward perſwaſion of his heart? I beleeue it not. For admit a King caſt out of his Kingdome were ſure to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape with life; yet being once reduced to a priuate ſtate of life, after hee hath wound or wrought himſelfe out of deadly danger, ſo farre he is from holding or retayning any remainder of dignity or politike impreſſion, that on the contrary he falleth into greater contempt and miſery, then if he had bene a very peaſant by birth, and had neuer held or gouerned the ſterne of Royall eſtate. What fowle is more beautifull then the peacocke? Let her be plumed and bereft of her feathers; what owle, what iacke-daw more ridiculous, more without all pleaſant faſhion? The homely ſowter, the infamous catchpol, the baſe tincker, the rude artificer, the pack-horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter, then liuing in Rome with libertie, when <hi>Valentinian</hi> was detain'd captiue by <hi>Saporas</hi> the Perſian King, was more happie then that Romane Emperour. And in caſe the L. Cardinall himſelfe ſhould bee ſo happie (I ſhould ſay ſo vnfortunate) to be ſtript of all his dignities and Eccleſiaſticall promotions; would it not redound to his Lordſhips wonderfull conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in his greateſt extremity, in the loweſt of his bareneſſe and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, he ſtill retaineth a certaine habituall right and character of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, whereby to recouer the loſſe of his former dignities and honours? when hee beholds theſe prints and impreſſions of his foreſaid honours; would it not make him the more willing and glad, to forſake the backe of his venerable mule, to vſe his Cardinals foot-cloath no longer, but euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter like a Cardinall in print and character, to walke on foot?</p>
                  <p>But let vs examine his Lordſhips conſolation of Kings, thruſt out of <q>their kingdomes by the Pope for hereſie. <hi>The obſtacle</hi> (as the L. Cardinall ſpeaketh) <hi>being taken away;</hi> that is to ſay, when the King ſhall be reformed; <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap> habituall right and character yet inherent in the perſon of a King, reſtores him to the lawfull adminiſtration of his Kingdome.</hi>
                     </q> I take this to be but a cold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: For here his Lordſhip doeth onely preſuppoſe, and not prooue, that after a King is thruſt out of his Throne, when hee ſhall repent and turne trew Romane Catholike the other by whom he hath bene caſt out, and by force diſſeiſed, will recall him to the Royall ſeat, and faithfully ſettle him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in his ancient right, as one that reioyceth for the recouery of ſuch a loſt ſheepe. But I ſhould rather feare, the new King would preſſe and ſtand
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:23110:255"/>vpon other termes; as a terme of yeeres for a triall, whether the repentance of the King diſplaced be trew &amp; ſound to the coare, or counterfeit, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and painted holines; for the words, the ſorrowfull and heauie lookes, the ſad and formall geſtures, of men pretending repentance, are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to bee taken, to be reſpected, to be credited. Againe, I ſhould feare the afflicted King might be charged and borne downe too, that albeit hee hath renounced his former hereſie, hee hath ſtumbled ſince at an other ſtone, and runne the ſhip of his faith againſt ſome other rocke of new here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall prauitie. Or I ſhould yet feare, he might be made to beleeue that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie maketh a deeper impreſſion, and a character more indeleble in the perſon, then is the other politike character of Regal Maieſtie. Alas, good Kings! in how hard, in how miſerable a ſtate doe they ſtand? Once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and euer barred of repentance: As if the ſcapes and errors of Kings, were all ſinnes againſt the Holy Ghoſt, or ſinnes vnto death, for which it is not lawfull to pray. Falls a pruiate perſon? he may be ſet vp, and new eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. Falls a King? is a King depoſed? his repentance is euer fruitleſſe, euer vnprofitable. Hath a priuate perſon a traine of ſeruants? He can not be depriued of any one without his priuitie and conſent. Hath a King mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of ſubiects? He may be depriued by the Pope of a third part, when his Holineſſe will haue them turne Clerics or enter Cloiſters, without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King leaue: and ſo of ſubiects they may be made non-ſubiects.</p>
                  <p>But I queſtion yet further. A King falling into hereſie, is depoſed by the Pope; his ſonne ſtands pure Catholike; The Regal ſeat is empty. Who ſhall ſucceed in the depoſed Kings place? Shall a ſtranger be preferred by the Pope? That were to doe the innocent ſonne egregious and notorious wrong. Shall the ſonne himſelfe? That were a more iniurious part in the ſonne againſt his father: For if the ſonne bee touched with any feare of God, or mooued with any reuerence towards his father, hee will diligently and ſeriouſly take heed, that hee put not his father by the Kingdome, by whoſe meanes he himſelfe is borne to a Kingdome. Nor will hee tread in the ſteps of <hi>Henry</hi> the V. Emperour, who by the Popes inſtigation, expelled and chaſed his aaged father out of the Imperiall dignitie. Much leſſe wil he hearken to the voice and aduiſe of Doctor <hi>Suares</hi> the <hi>Ieſuite,</hi>

<pb n="467" facs="tcp:23110:255"/>The ſonne then by this doctrine, ſhall imbrew his hands in his owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers blood, ſo ſoone as he ſhall be depoſed by the Pope. A matter ſo much the neerer and more deepely to bee apprehended, becauſe the ſaid moſt outragious booke flyeth like a furious maſtiffe directly at my throat, and withall inſtilleth ſuch precepts into the tender diſpoſition of my ſonne, as if hereafter hee ſhall become a Romane Catholike, ſo ſoone as the Pope ſhall giue me the lift out of my Throne, ſhall bind him forthwith to make effuſion of his owne fathers blood. Such is the religion of theſe reuerend Fathers, the pillars of the Pontificiall Monarchie: In compariſon of whoſe religion and holineſſe, all the impietie that euer was among the Infidels, and all the barbarous crueltie that euer was among the Canibals, may paſſe hencefoorth in the Chriſtian world for pure clemencie and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. Theſe things ought his Lordſhip to haue pondered, rather then to babble of habitudes and politike characters, which to the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are like the Bergamaſque or the wilde-Iriſh forme of ſpeach, and paſſe their vnderſtanding.</p>
                  <p>All theſe things are nothing in a maner, if we compare them with the laſt clauſe, which is the cloſer, and as it were the vpſhot of his Lordſhips diſcourſe: For therein he laboureth to perſwade concerning this Article, framed to bridle the Popes tyrannicall power ouer Kings, if it ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue gracious entertainement, and generall approbation; <q>
                        <hi>That it would breed great danger, and worke effects of pernicious conſequence vnto Kings.</hi> The reaſon: <hi>becauſe it would prooue an introduction to ſchiſme; and ſchiſme would ſtirre vp ciuil warres, contempt of Kings, distempered inclinations and motions to intrap their life; and which is worſt of all, the fierce wrath of God, inflicting all ſorts of calamities.</hi>
                     </q> An admirable paradoxe, and able to ſtrike men ſtone-blind: that his Holineſſe muſt haue power to depoſe Kings, for the better ſecurity and ſafegard of their life; that when their Crownes are made ſubiect vnto anothers will and pleaſure, then they are come to the higheſt altitude and eleuation of honour; that for the onely warrant of their life, their ſupreme and abſolute greatneſſe muſt be depreſſed; that for the longer keeping of their Crownes, another muſt plucke the Crowne from their heads. As if it ſhould be ſaid, Would they not be ſtript naked by another? the beſt way is, for themſelues to vntruſſe, for themſelues to put off all, and to goe naked of their owne accord. Wil they keepe their Souereigntie in ſafetie for euer? The beſt way is to let another haue their Soueraigne authoritie and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Eſtate in his power. But I haue bene euer of this mind, that when my goods are at no mans command or diſpoſing but mine own, then they are trewly and certainly mine owne. It may be this error is growen vpon me and other Princes for lacke of braines: whereupon it may be feared, or at leaſt coniectured, the Pope meanes to ſhaue our crownes, and thruſt vs into ſome cloiſter, there to hold ranke in the brotherhood of good King <hi>Childerie.</hi> Foraſmuch then as my dull capacitie doeth not ſerue mee to reach or comprehend the pith of this admirable reaſon, I haue thought
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:23110:256"/>good to ſeeke and to vſe the inſtruction of old and learned experience, which teacheth no ſuch matter: by name, that ciuill warres and fearefull perturbations of State in any nation of the world, haue at any time growen from this faithful credulity of ſubiects, that Popes in right haue no power to wreſt and lift Kings out of their dignities and poſſeſſions. On the other ſide, by eſtabliſhing the contrary maximes, to yoke and hamper the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with Pontificiall tyrannie, what rebellious troubles and ſtirres, what extreme deſolations hath <hi>England</hi> bene forced to feare and feele, in the Reigne of my Predeceſſours <hi>Henrie</hi> II. <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Henrie</hi> III? Theſe be the maximes and principles, which vnder the Emperour <hi>Henrie</hi> IV. and <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric</hi> the I. made all <hi>Europe</hi> flowe with channels and ſtreames of blood, like a riuer with water, while the Saracens by their incurſions and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ouerflowed, and in a manner drowned the honour of the Chriſtian name in the Eaſt. Theſe be the maximes and principles, which made way for the warres of the laſt League into <hi>France;</hi> by which the very bowels of that moſt famous and flouriſhing Kingdome were ſet on ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtion, that <hi>France</hi> her ſelfe was brought within two fingers breadth of bondage to another Nation, and the death of her two laſt Kings moſt villenouſly and traiterouſly accompliſhed. The L. Cardinall then giuing theſe diabolicall maximes for meanes to ſecure the life and Eſtate of Kings, ſpeaketh as if he would giue men counſell to dry themſelues in the riuer, when they come as wet as a water ſpaniell out of a pond; or to warme themſelues by the light of the Moone, when they are ſtark-naked, and well neere frozen to death.</p>

The first rowlers of that ſtone of offence, aimed at no

Hee thinks the Deputies of the third Eſtate, had neither head nor first hand in contriuing this Article; but holds it rather a new deuice and ſubtile inuention, ſuggeſted by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which beeing already cut off by their owne practiſes from the body of the Romane Church, haue likewiſe inueigled and inſnared ſome that beare the name of Catholiks, with ſome other Eccleſiaſtics; and vnder a faire pretence and goodly cloake, by name, the ſeruice of the King, haue ſurpriſed and played vpon their ſimplicitie. Theſe men</hi> (as the Cardinall ſaith) <hi>doe imitate</hi> Iulian <hi>the Apoſtata, who to bring the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to idolatrous worſhip of falſe gods, commaunded the idols of</hi> Iupiter <hi>and</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus <hi>to be intermingled with Imperiall ſtatues, and other Images of Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, &amp;c.</hi> Then after certaine Rhetoricall flouriſhes, his Lordſhip fals to proſecute his former courſe, and cries out of this Article; <hi>A monſter hauing the tayle of a fiſh, as if it came cutting the narrow Seas out of</hi> England: <hi>For in full effect it is downright the</hi> Engliſh <hi>oath; ſauing that indeed the oath of</hi> England <hi>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in a more mild forme, and a more moderate ſtraine.</hi> And here he ſuddenly takes occaſion to make ſome digreſſion: For out of the way, and cleane from the matter, he entreth into ſome purpoſe <hi>of my praiſe and commendation:</hi> He courteouſly for ſooth is pleaſed to grace mee <hi>with knowledge of learning, and with ciuill vertues:</hi> He ſeemeth chiefly to reioyce in his owne behalfe, and to giue me thanks, <hi>that I haue done him the honour to enter the liſts of Theologicall diſpute againſt his Lordſhip.</hi> Howbeit he twitches and carpes at me withall, as at one that ſoweth ſeeds of diſſention and ſchiſme amongſt Romane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks: And yet he would ſeeme to qualifie the matter, and to make all whole againe, by ſaying, <hi>That in ſo doing I am perſwaded I doe no more then my duetie requires. But now</hi> (as his Lordſhip followes the point) <hi>it ſtandeth neither with godlineſſe, nor with equity, nor with reaſon, that Acts made, that Statutes, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and Ordinances ratified for the State and Gouernement of</hi> England, <hi>ſhould be thrust for binding Laws vpon the Kingdome of</hi> France: <hi>nor that Catholikes, and much leſse that Eccleſiaſtics, to the ende they may liue in ſafetie, and freely enioy their priuiledges or immunities in</hi> France, <hi>ſhould be forced to beleeue, and by oath to ſeale the ſame points, which</hi> Engliſh <hi>Catholikes to the end they may purchaſe libertie onely to breath, nay ſorrowfully to ſigh rather, are conſtrained to allow and to aduow beſides. And where as in</hi> England <hi>There is no ſmall number of Catholikes, that lacke not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and reſolute minds to endure all ſorts of puniſhment, rather then to take that oath of allegiance; will there not be found an other manner of number in</hi> France, <hi>armed with no leſſe constancie and Chriſtian reſolution? There will, most honourable Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, there will without all doubt: and we all that are of Epiſcopall dignity will ſooner ſuffer Martyrdome in the cauſe.</hi> Then out of the ſuper-abundance and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weight of his Lordſhips goodnes, he cloſely coucheth and conuayeth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine diſtaſtfull oppoſition betweene mee and his King; with praiſes and thanks to God, that <hi>his King is not delighted, &amp; takes no pleaſure to make Martyrs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All this Artificiall and ſwelling diſcourſe like vnto puffe-paſt, if it be viewed at a neere diſtance, will be found like a bladder full of wind, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſoliditie of ſubſtantiall matter. For the Deputies of the third
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:23110:257"/>Eſtate were neuer ſo voide of vnderſtanding, to beleeue that by prouiding for the life and ſafety of their King, they ſhould thruſt him headlong into eternall damnation. Their braines were neuer ſo much blaſted, ſo farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed, to dreame the ſoule of their King cannot mount vp to heauen, except he be diſmounted from his Princely Throne vpon earth, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Pope ſhall hold vp his finger.</p>
                  <p>And whereas he is bold to pronounce, that heretikes of <hi>France</hi> doe make their benefit and aduantage of this diuiſion; that ſpeech is grounded vpon this propoſition; That profeſſors of the Chriſtian Religion reformed (which is to ſay, purged and cleanſed of all Popiſh dregs) are heretikes in fact, and ought ſo to bee reputed in right: Which propoſition his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will neuer ſoundly and ſufficiently make good, before his Holineſſe hath compiled an other Goſpell, or hath forged an other Bible at his Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall anuile. The L. Cardinall vndertooke to reade mee a lecture vpon that argument; but euer ſince hath played Mum-budget, and hath put himſelfe to ſilence, like one at a Non-plus in his enterpriſe. There be three yeeres already gone and paſt, ſince his Lordſhip beganne to ſhape ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to a certaine writing diſpatched by mee in few daies: With forming and reforming, with filing and poliſhing, with labouring and licking his anſwere ouer and ouer againe, with reiterated extractions and calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, it may be coniectured that all his Lordſhips labour and coſt is long ſince evaporated and vaniſhed in the aire. Howbeit, as well the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conference of a King, (for I will not call it a contention) as alſo the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, excellencie, and importance of the matter, long ſince deſerued, and as long ſince required the publiſhing of ſome or other anſwere. His Lordſhips long ſilence will neuer be imputed to lacke of capacity, wherewith who knoweth not how abundantly he is furniſhed; but rather to well aduiſed agnition of his owne working and building vpon a weake foundation.</p>
                  <p>But let vs returne vnto theſe heretikes, that make ſo great gaine by the diſagreement of Catholikes. It is no part of their dutie to aime at ſowing of diſſentions; but rather to intend and attend their faithfull performance of ſeruice to their King. If ſome be pleaſed, and others offended, when ſo good and loyall duties are ſincerely diſcharged; it is for all good ſubiects to grieue and to be ſory, that when they ſpeake for the ſafetie of their King &amp; honour of the trewth, it is their hard hap to leaue any at all vnſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. But ſuppoſe the ſaid heretiks were the Authors of this article preferred by the third Eſtate: What need they to conceale their names in that regard? What need they to diſclaime the credit of ſuch a worthy act? Would it not redound to their perpetuall honour, to be the onely ſubiects that kept watch ouer the Kings life and Crowne, that ſtood centinell, and walked the rounds for the preſeruation of his Princely diademe, when all other had no more touch, no more feeling thereof then ſo many ſtones? And what neede the Deputies for the third Eſtate, to receiue inſtructions from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Kingdomes, concerning a cauſe of that nature; when there was
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:23110:257"/>no want of domeſticall examples, and the French hiſtories were plentifull in that argument? What neede they to gape for this reformed doctrine, to come ſwimming with a fiſhes tayle out of an Iſland to the mayne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, when they had before their eyes the murders of two Kings, with diuerſe ciuill warres, and many Arreſts of Court, all tending to inſinuate and ſuggeſt the introduction of the ſame remedy? Suggeſtions are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe from abroad, when the miſchiefe is felt at home. it ſeemes to me that his Lordſhip in ſmoothing and tickling the Deputies for the third Eſtate, doth no leſſe then wring and wrong their great ſufficiencie with contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and outragious abuſe; as if they were not furniſhed with ſufficient fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, and with loyall affection towards their King, for the preſeruation of his life and honour, if the remedie were not beaten into their heads by thoſe of the Religion, reputed heretikes.</p>
                  <p>Touching my ſelfe, ranged by his Lordſhip in the ſame ranke with ſowers of diſſention; I take my God to witnes, and my owne conſcience, that I neuer dream'd of any ſuch vnchriſtian proiect. It hath beene hitherto my ordinary courſe to follow honeſt counſells, and to walke in open waies. I neuer wonted my ſelfe to holes and corners, to crafty ſhifts, but euermore to plaine and open deſignes. I neede not hide mine intentions for feare of any mortall man, that puffeth breath of life out of his noſtrils. Nor in any ſort doe I purpoſe, to ſet <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtata before mine eyes, as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for me to follow. <hi>Iulian</hi> of a Chriſtian became a Pagan: I profeſſe the ſame faith of Chriſt ſtill, which I haue euer profeſſed: <hi>Iulian</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his deſignes with crafty conueiances; I neuer with any of his capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and cunning ſleights: <hi>Iulian</hi> forced his ſubiects to infidelitie againſt I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; I labour to induce my ſubiects vnto ſuch tearmes of loyalty towards my ſelfe, as Ieſus Chriſt hath preſcribed and taught in his word. But how farre I differ from <hi>Iulian,</hi> it is to be ſeene more at large in my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Epiſtles written to <hi>Blackwell;</hi> from whence the Lord Cardinall borrowing this example, it might well haue beſeemed his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to borrow likewiſe my anſwere from the ſame place.</p>
                  <p>Now as it mooues me nothing at all, to be drawne by his Lordſhip into ſuſpitions of this nature and qualitie: ſo by the prayſes, that he rockes me withall, I will neuer be lulled aſleepe. To commend a man for his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and withall to take from him the feare of God, is to admire a ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for his goodly head of haire or his curled locks, and withall to call him baſe coward, faint-hearted and freſh-water ſouldier. Knowledge, wit, and learning in an hereticke, are of none other vſe and ſeruice, but only to make him the more culpable, &amp; conſequently obnoxious to the more grieuous puniſhments. All vertues turne to vices, when they become the ſeruants of impietie. The hand-maids which the Soueraigne Lady Wiſedome calleth to be of her traine in the 9. Prouerb. are morall vertues, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſciences; which then become pernicious, when they run away from their Soueraigne Lady-Miſtris, and put ouer themſelues in ſeruice to the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:23110:258"/>diuel. What difference is betweene two men, both alike wanting the knowledge of God; the one furniſhed with arts and ciuill vertues, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brutiſhly barbarous and of a deformed life, or of prophane maners? What is the difference betweene theſe two? I make this the onely difference: the firſt goeth to hell with a better grace, and falleth into perdition with more facilitie, then the ſecond: But hee becommeth exceedingly wicked, euen threefold and fourefold abominable, if he waſt his treaſure and ſtocke of ciuill vertues in perſecuting the Church of CHRIST: and if that may be layd in his diſh which was caſt in <hi>Caeſars</hi> teeth, that in plaine ſobernes and well-ſetled temper, he attempts the ruine of the Common-wealth, which from a drunken ſot might receiue perhaps a more eaſie fall. In briefe, I ſcorne all garlands of praiſes, which are not euer greene; but being dry and withered for want of ſap and radicall moyſture, doe flagge about barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Princes browes. I defie and renounce thoſe praiſes, which fit mee no more then they fit a <hi>Mahumetane</hi> King of <hi>Marocco.</hi> I conteſt againſt all praiſes which grace me with petie acceſſories, but rob me of the principall, that one thing neceſſary; namely, the feare and knowledge of my GOD: vnto whoſe Maieſtie alone, I haue deuoted my Scepter, my ſword, my penne, my whole induſtrie, my whole ſelfe, with all that is mine in whole and in part. I doe it, I doe it in all humble acknowledgement of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable mercie and fauour, who hath vouchſafed to deliuer me from the erroneous way of this aage, to deliuer my Kingdome from the Popes ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall yoke, vnder which it hath lyen in times paſt moſt grieuouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: My Kingdom where God is now purely ſerued, and called vpon in a tongue which all the vulgar vnderſtand: My Kingdome, where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may now reade the Scriptures without any ſpecial priuiledge from the Apoſtolike See, and with no leſſe libertie then the people of Epheſus, of Rome, and of Corinth did reade the holy Epiſtles, written to their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by <hi>S.

For the reſt, it ſhal by Gods grace be my daily endeauour and ſerious care, to paſſe my daies in ſhaping to my ſelfe ſuch a courſe of life, that without ſhamefull calumniating of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it ſhall not reſt in the tip of any tongue, to touch my life with iuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion or blame. Nor am I ſo priuie to mine owne guiltineſſe, as to thinke my ſtate ſo deſperate, ſo deplorable, as Popes haue made their owne: For ſome of them haue bene ſo open-hearted and ſo tongue-free, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that Popes themſelues, the key-bearers of Heauen and hell, cannot

                  <p>But if the L. Cardinall by aſſured and certaine knowledge (as perhaps he may by common fame) did vnderſtand the horrible conſpiracies that haue bin plotted and contriued, not againſt my perſon and life alone, but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my whole ſtocke: if he rightly knew &amp; were inly perſwaded, of how many fowle periuries &amp; wicked treaſons, diuers Eccleſiaſtical perſons haue bene lawfully conuicted: in ſtead of charging me with falſe imputations, that <hi>I ſuffer not my Catholiks to fetch a ſigh, or to draw their breath; and that I thruſt my Catholikes vpon the ſharpe edge of puniſhment in euery kinde;</hi> he would, and might well, rather wonder, how I my ſelfe, after ſo many dangers run, after ſo many proditorious ſnares eſcaped, do yet fetch my owne breath, and yet practiſe Princely elemencie towards the ſaid Catholiks, notorious tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of diuine &amp; humane lawes. If the French king in the heart of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſhould nouriſh and foſter ſuch a neſt of ſtinging hornets and buſie waſps, I meane ſuch a pack of ſubiects, denying his abſolute Soueraignty, as many Romane Catholiks of my Kingdome do mine: It may wel be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether the L. Cardinal would aduiſe his king ſtil to feather the neſt of the ſaid Catholiks, ſtil to keep them warme, ſtil to beare them with an eaſie and gentle hand: It may wel be doubted, whether his Lordſhip would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol their conſtancie, that would haue the courage to ſheath vp their ſwords in his Kings bowels, or blow vp his King with gun-powder, into the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtation of the loweſt regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: It may wel be doubted, whether he would indure that Orator, who (like as himſelfe hath done) ſhould ſtir vp others to ſuffer Martyrdome after ſuch examples, and to imitate parricides &amp; traitors in their conſtancy. The ſcope then of the L. Cardinall, in ſtriking the ſweet ſtrings, and ſounding the pleaſant notes of praiſes, which faine he would fil mine eares withal; is only by his excellent skil in the muſick of Oratory, to bewitch the harts of my ſubiects, to infatuate their minds, to ſettle them in a
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:23110:259"/>reſolution to depriue me of my life. The reaſon: Becauſe the plotters and practiſers againſt my life, are honoured and rewarded with a glorious name of Martyrs: their conſtancie (what els?) is admired, when they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer death for treaſon. Wheras hitherto during the time of my whole raigne to this day, (I ſpeake it in the word of a King, and trewth it ſelfe ſhall make good the Kings word) no man hath loſt his life, no man hath indured the Racke, no man hath ſuffered corporall puniſhment in other kinds, meerely or ſimply, or in any degree of reſpect, for his conſcience in matter of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but for wicked conſpiring againſt my life, or Eſtate, or Royall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; or els for ſome notorious crime, or ſome obſtinate and wilfull diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: Of which traiterous and viperous brood, I commanded one to be hanged by the necke of late in <hi>Scotland;</hi> a Ieſuite of intolerable impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, who at his arraignment and publike triall, ſtiffely maintained, that I haue robbed the Pope of his right, and haue no manner of right in the poſſeſſion of my Kingdome. His Lordſhip therefore in offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to Martyrdome, after the rare example of Catholiks, as he ſaith, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering all ſort of puniſhment in my Kingdome, doeth plainely profeſſe himſelfe a follower of traytors and parricides. Theſe be the Worthies, theſe the heroicall ſpirits, theſe the honourable Captaines and Coronels, whoſe vertuous parts neuer ſufficiently magnified and prayſed, his Lordſhippe propoundeth for imitation to the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops. O the name of Martyrs, in olde times a ſacred name! how is it now derided and ſcoffed? how is it in theſe daies filthily prophaned? O you the whole quire and holy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Apoſtles, who haue ſealed the trewth with your deareſt blood! how much are you diſparaged? how vnfitly are you paragoned and matched, when traytors, bloody butchers, and King-killers are made your aſſiſtants, and of the ſame <hi>Quorum;</hi> or to ſpeake in milder tearmes, when you are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with Martyrs that ſuffer for maintaining the Temporall rites of the Popes Empire? with Biſhops that offer themſelues to a Problematicall Martyrdome, for a point decided neither by the authorities of your Spirit-inſpired pens, nor by the auncient and venerable teſtimonie of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church? for a point which they dare not vndertake to teach, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then by a doubtfull, cold, fearefull way of diſcourſe, and altogether without reſolution. In good ſooth, I take the Cardinall for a perſonage of a quicker ſpirit and clearer ſight, (let his Lordſhip hold mee excuſed) then to perſwade my ſelfe, that in theſe matters his tongue and his heart, his pen and his inward iudgement, haue any concord or correſpondence one with another: For beeing very much againſt his minde (as hee doeth confeſſe) thruſt into the office of an Aduocate to pleade this cauſe; he ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bee carried (after his engagement) with ſome heat, to vtter ſome things againſt his conſcience, murmuring and grumbling the contrary within; and to affirme ſome other things with confidence, whereof hee had not beene otherwiſe informed, then onely by vaine and lying report. Of which ranke is that bold aſſertion of his Lordſhip; That many Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:23110:259"/>in England, rather then they would ſubſcribe to the oath of allegiance in the forme thereof, haue vndergone all ſorts of puniſhment: For in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (as we haue trewly giuen the whole Chriſtian world to vnderſtand in our Preface to the Apologie) there is but one forme or kind of puniſhment ordained for all ſorts of traytors.</p>
                  <p>Hath not his Lordſhip now graced me with goodly teſtimonialls of prayſe and commendation? Am I not by his prayſes proclaimed a Tyrant, as it were inebriated with blood of the Saints, and a famous Enginer of torments for my Catholikes? To this exhortation for the ſuffering of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, in imitation of my Engliſh traytors and parricides, if wee ſhall adde; how craftily and ſubtilly hee makes the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to hold of the Pope by fealty, and their kingdome in bondage to the Pope by Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall recognizance; it ſhall eaſily appeare, that his holy-water of prayſes wherewith I am ſo reuerently beſprinkled, is a compoſition extracted out of a dram of hony and a pound of gall, firſt ſteeped in a ſtrong decoction of bitter wormewood, or of the wild gourd called Coloquintida: For after he hath in the beginning of his Oration,
<note place="margin">Page. 10.</note> ſpoken of Kings that owe fealtie to the Pope, and are not Soueraignes in the higheſt degree of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ſupremacie within their Kingdomes; to explaine his mind and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the better, he marſhals the Kings of <hi>England</hi> a little after in the ſame ranke. His words be theſe; <hi>When King</hi> Iohn <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>not yet bound in any temporall recognizance to the Pope, had expelled his Biſhops, &amp;c.</hi> His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip means, that King <hi>Iohn</hi> became ſo bound to the Pope not long after. And what may this meaning be, but in plaine tearmes and broad ſpeach, to call me vſurper and vnlawfull King? For the feudatarie, or he that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a Mannor by fealty, when he doeth not his homage, with all ſuit and ſeruice that he owes to the Lord <hi>Paramount,</hi> doeth fall from the propertie of his fee. This reproach of the L. Cardinals, is ſeconded with an other of <hi>Bellarmines</hi> his brother Cardinall; That <hi>Ireland</hi> was giuen to the Kings of <hi>England</hi> by the Pope. The beſt is that his moſt reuerend Lordſhip hath not ſhewed, who it was that gaue <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Pope.</p>
                  <p>And touching <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> thus in briefe ſtands the whole matter. Betweene <hi>Henry</hi> 2. and the Pope had paſſed ſundry bickerments, about collating of Eccleſiaſticall dignities. <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſonne, after his fathers death, reneweth, vndertaketh, and purſueth the ſame quarrell: Driueth certaine <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops out of the Kingdome, for defending the Popes inſolent vſurpation vpon his Royall prerogatiue, and Regall rights: Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch Princely courage and reſolution in thoſe times, when all that ſtood and ſuffered for the Popes Temporall pretenſions againſt Kings, were enrowled Martyrs or Confeſſors. The Pope takes the matter in fowle ſcorne, and great indignation; ſhuts the King by his excommunicatory Bulls out of the Church; ſtirres vp his Barons, for other cauſes the Kings heauy friends, to riſe in armes; giues the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> (like a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterleſſe man turned ouer to a new maſter) to <hi>Philippus Augustus</hi> King of
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:23110:260"/>
                     <hi>France;</hi> bindes <hi>Philip</hi> to make a conqueſt of <hi>England</hi> by the ſword, or elſe no bargaine, or elſe no gift; promiſes <hi>Philip,</hi> in recompence of his trauell and Royall expences in that conqueſt, full abſolution and a generall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don at large for all his ſinnes: to bee ſhort, cuts King <hi>Iohn</hi> out ſo much worke, and makes him keepe ſo many yrons in the fire for his worke, that he had none other way, none other meanes to pacifie the Popes high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, to correct or qualifie the malignitie of the Popes cholericke hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, by whom he was then ſo entangled in the Popes toyles, but by yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe to become the Popes vaſſal, and his Kingdome feudatary, or to hold by fealty of the Papall See. By this meanes his Crowne is made tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary, all his people liable to payment of taxes by the poll for a certaine yeerely tribute, and he is bleſſed with a pardon for all his ſinnes. Whether King <hi>Iohn</hi> was mooued to doe this diſhonourable act vpon any deuotion, or inflamed with any zeale of Religion; or inforced by the vnreſiſtable weapons of neceſſitie, who can be ſo blind, that he doeth not well ſee and clearely perceiue? For to purchaſe his owne freedome from this bondage to the Pope; what could he bee vnwilling to doe, that was willing to bring his Kingdome vnder the yoake of <hi>Amirales Murmelinus</hi> a Mahumetan Prince, then King of <hi>Granado</hi> and <hi>Barbaria?</hi> The Pope after that, ſent a Legat into <hi>England:</hi> The King now the Popes vaſſall, and holding his Crowne of the Pope, like a man that holds his land of another by Knights ſeruice, or by homage and fealtie, doeth faire homage for his Crowne to the Popes Legat, and layeth downe at his feet a great maſſe of the pureſt gold in coyne. The reuerend Legat, in token of his Maſters Soueraigntie, with more then vſuall pride falls to kicking and ſpurning the treaſure, no doubt with a paire of moſt holy feet: Not onely ſo; but likewiſe at ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne feaſts is eaſily entreated to take the Kings chaire of Eſtate. Heere I would faine know the Lord Cardinals opinion; whether theſe actions of the Pope were iuſt or vniuſt, lawfull or vnlawfull, according to right or againſt all right and reaſon. If he will ſay againſt right; it is then cleare, that againſt right his Lordſhip hath made way to this example: if accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to right, let him then make it knowen, from whence or from whom this power was deriued and conueyed to the Pope, whereby hee makes himſelfe Souereigne Lord of Temporalties in that Kingdome, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he nor any of his predeceſſours euer pretended any right, or layd any claime to Temporall matters before. Are ſuch prankes to be played by the Pontificiall Biſhop? Is this an act of Holineſſe, to ſet a Kingdome on fire by the flaming brands of ſedition? to diſmember and quarter a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with inteſtine warres; onely to this end, that a King once reduced to the loweſt degree of miſerie, might be lifted by his Holineſſe out of his Royall prerogatiue, the very ſoule and life of his Royall Eſtate? When began this Papall power? In what aage began the Pope to practiſe this power? What! haue the ancient Canons, (for the Scripture in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion beareth no pawme) haue the Canons of the ancient Church impoſed
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:23110:260"/>any ſuch ſatisfaction vpon a ſinner, that of a Souereigne and free King, he ſhould become vaſſall to his ghoſtly Father; that he ſhould make himſelfe together with all his people and ſubiects tributaries to a Biſhop, that ſhall rifle a whole Nation of their coine, that ſhall receiue homage of a King, and make a King his vaſſall? What! Shall not a ſinner be quitted of his faults, except his Paſtor turne robber, and one that goeth about to get a booty? except hee make his Paſtour a Feoffee in his whole Eſtate, and ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnder a ſhadow of penance to freeze naked, to be turned out of all his goods and poſſeſſions of inheritance? But be it granted, admit his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe robs one Prince of his rights and reuenewes, to conferre the ſame vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another: were it not an high degree of tyrannie to finger another mans eſtate, and to giue that away to a third, which the ſecond hath no right, no lawfull authoritie to giue? Well, if the Pope then ſhall become his owne caruer in the rights of another; if he ſhall make his owne coffers to ſwell with anothers reuenewes, if he ſhall decke and aray his owne backe in the ſpoiles of a ſinner, with whom in abſolution he maketh peace, and taketh truce; what can this be elſe, but running into further degrees of wickedneſſe and miſchiefe? what can this be elſe, but heaping of robbery vpon fraud, and Impietie vpon robbery? For by ſuch deceitfull, craftie, and cunning practiſes, the nature of the Pontificiall See, meerely ſpirituall, is changed into the Kings-bench-Court, meerely temporall: the Biſhops chaire is changed into a Monarchs Throne. And not onely ſo; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the ſinners repentance is changed into a ſnare or pit-fall of couſening deceit; and S. <hi>Peters</hi> net is changed into a caſting-net or a flew, to fiſh for all the wealth of moſt flouriſhing Kingdomes. Moreouer, the King (a hard caſe) is driuen by ſuch wiles and ſubtilties, to worke impoſſibilities, to acte more then is lawfull or within the compaſſe of his power to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: For the King neither may in right, nor can by power tranſ-nature his Crowne, impaire the Maieſtie of his Kingdome, or leaue his Royal dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie leſſe free to his heire apparant, or next ſucceſſor, then he receiued the ſame of his predeceſſour: Much leſſe, by any diſhonourable capitulations, by any vnworthy contracts, degrade his poſteritie, bring his people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the grieuous burden of tributes and taxes to a forreine Prince: Leaſt of all, make them tributary to a Prieſt; vnto whom it no way apperteineth to haue any hand in the ciuill affaires of Kings, or to diſtaine, and vnhallow their Crownes. And therefore when the Pope diſpatched his <hi>Nuntio</hi> to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus Auguſtus,</hi> requeſting the King to auert <hi>Lewis</hi> his ſonne from laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny claime to the Kingdome of <hi>England; Philip</hi> anſwered the Legat (as we haue it in <hi>Matth. Paris;</hi>) <hi>No King, no Prince can alienate or giue away his Kingdom, but by conſent of his Barons, bound by Knights ſeruice to defend the ſaid Kingdome: and in caſe the Pope ſhall ſtand for the contrary error, his Holines ſhall giue to King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes a moſt pernicious example.</hi> By the ſame Author it is teſtified, that King <hi>Iohn</hi> became odious to his ſubiects, for ſuch diſhonourable and vnworthy inthralling of his Crowne, and Kingdome. Therefore the Popes right pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:23110:261"/>to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> which is nothing elſe but a ridiculous vſurpation, hath long agoe vaniſhed into ſmoake, and required not ſo much as the drawing of one ſword to ſnatch and pull it by violence out of his hands: For the Popes power lying altogether in a certaine wilde and wandring conceit or opinion of men, and being onely an imaginary caſtle in the ayre, built by pride, and vnderpropped by ſuperſtition, is very ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diſperſed vpon the firſt riſing and appearing of the trewth in her glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious brightneſſe. There is none ſo very a dolt or block-head to deny, that in caſe this right of the Pope ouer <hi>England,</hi> is grounded vpon Gods word, then his Holineſſe may challenge the like right ouer all other Kingdomes: becauſe all other Kingdomes, Crownes, and Scepters are ſubiect alike to Gods word: For what priuiledge, what charter, what euidence can <hi>France</hi> fetch out of the Rolles, or any other treaſurie of her monuments or records, to ſhew that ſhe oweth leſſe ſubiection to God then <hi>England?</hi> Or was this yoke of bondage then brought vpon the Engliſh Nation; was it a prerogatiue, whereby they might more eaſily come to the libertie of the ſonnes of God? Or were the people of <hi>England</hi> perſwaded, that for all their ſubſtance, wealth, and life beſtowed on the Pope, his Holineſſe by way of exchange returned them better weight and meaſure of ſpirituall graces? It is ridiculous, onely to conceiue theſe toyes in thought; and yet with ſuch ridiculous, with ſuch toyes in conceit, his Lordſhip feeds and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains his auditors.</p>
                  <p>From this point hee falleth to another bowt and fling at his heretikes, with whom he played no faire play before:

                     </q> But herein his Lordſhip ſhooteth farre from the marke. This Article is approoued and preached by the Miniſters of my Kingdome: It is likewiſe preached by thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> and if need bee (I aſſſure my ſelfe) will bee ſigned by all the Miniſters of the French Church.</p>
                  <p>The L. Cardinall proceedeth, (for hee meaneth not ſo ſoone to giue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer theſe heretikes:) <q>
                        <hi>All their Conſistortes beleeue it as their Creed; that if Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Princes at any time ſhall offer force vnto their conſcience, then they are diſpenſed withall for their oath of alleagiance. Hence are theſe modifications and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricitions, toſſed ſo much in their mouthes; Prouided the King force vs not in our conſcience. Hence are theſe exceptions in the profeſsion of their faith; Prouided the Soueraigne power and authoritie of God, bee not in any ſort violated or infringed.</hi>
                     </q> I am not able to conceiue what engine can bee framed of theſe materialls, for the bearing of Kings out of their eminent ſeates, by any lawfull autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie or power in the Pope: For ſay, thoſe of the Religion ſhould be tainted with ſome like errour; how can that be any ſhelter of excuſe for thoſe of the Romiſh Church, to vndermine or to digge vp the Thrones of their Kings? But in this allegation of the L. Cardinall, there is nothing at all, which doeth not iumpe iuſt and accord to a haire with the Article of the
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:23110:261"/>third Eſtate, and with obedience due to the King: For they doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that in caſe the King ſhall commaund them to doe any act contrarie to their conſcience, they would flie at his throat, would make any attempt againſt his life, would refuſe to pay their taxations, or to defend him in the warres: They make no profeſſion of depoſing the King, or diſcharging the people from the oath of allegiance tendred to the King: which is the very point or iſſue of the matter in controuerſie, and the maine miſcheife, againſt which the third Eſtate hath bin moſt worthily carefull to prouide a wholeſome remedie by this Article. There is a world of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the termes of diſobedience, and of depoſition. It is one thing to diſobey the Kings commaund in matters prohibited by diuine lawes, and yet in all other matters to performe full ſubiection vnto the King. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing of a farre higher degree or ſtraine of diſloyaltie, to bare the King of his Royall robes, throne, and ſcepter, and when he is thus farre diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced, to degrade him and to put him from his degree and place of a King. If the holy Father ſhould charge the L. Cardinal to doe ſome act repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in his owne knowledge to the Law of God, I will religiouſly, and according to the rule of charitie preſume, that his Lordſhip in this caſe would ſtand out againſt his Holineſſe, and notwithſtanding would ſtill acknowledge him to be Pope.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>His Lordſhip yet proſecutes and followes his former purpoſe: <hi>Hence are thoſe armes which they haue oftentimes borne againſt Kings, when Kings practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take away the libertie of their conſcience and Religion. Hence are thoſe turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Commotions and ſeditions by them raiſed, as well in the Low-countryes against the King of Spaine, as in Swethland againſt the Catholike King of Polonia.</hi>
                     </q> Beſides, he caſteth <hi>Iunius Brutus, Buchananus, Barclaius,</hi> and <hi>Gerſon</hi> in our teeth. To what end all this? I ſee not how it can bee auaileable to authorize the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Kings, eſpecially the Popes power to depoſe. And yet his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip here doth outface (by his leaue) and beare downe the trewth: For I could neuer yet learne by any good and trew intelligence, that in France thoſe of the Religion tooke armes at any time againſt their King: In the firſt ciuill warres they ſtood onely vpon their guard: they ſtood onely to their lawfull wards and locks of defence: they armed not, nor tooke the field before they were purſued with fire and ſword, burnt vp and ſlaughtred. Beſides, Religion was neither the root nor the rynde of thoſe inteſtine troubles. The trew ground of the quarrell was this: During the minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of King <hi>Francis</hi> II. the Proteſtants of France were a refuge and ſuccour to the Princes of the blood, when they were kept from the Kings preſence, and by the ouer powring power of their enemies, were no better then plaine driuen and chaſed from the Court. I meane, the Grand-father of the King now raigning, and the Grand-father of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> when they had no place of ſafe retreate. In regard of which worthy and honourable ſeruice, it may ſeeme the French King hath reaſon to haue the Proteſtants in his gracious remembrance. With other commotion or inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:23110:262"/>the Proteſtants are not iuſtly to be charged. But on the contrary, certaine it is that King <hi>Henry</hi> III. rayſed and ſent forth ſeuerall armies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſtants, to ruine and roote them out of the Kingdome: howbeit, ſo ſoone as they perceiued the ſaid King was brought into dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tearms, they ranne with great ſpeed and ſpeciall fidelitie to the Kings reſcue and ſuccour, in the preſent danger. Certaine it is, that by their good ſeruice the ſaid King was deliuered, from a moſt extreame and imminent perill of his life in the city of Tours. Certaine it is, they neuer abandoned that <hi>Henry</hi> 3. nor his next ſucceſſor <hi>Henry</hi> 4. in all the heat of reuolts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, raiſed in the greateſt part of the Kingdome by the Pope, and the more part of the Clergie but ſtood to the ſaid Kings in all their battels, to beare vp the Crowne then tottering and ready to fall. Certaine it is, that euen the heads and principalls of thoſe by whom the late King deceaſed was purſued with all extremities, at this day doe enioy the fruit of all the good ſeruices done to the King by the ſaid Proteſtants: And they are now diſgraced, kept vnder, expoſed to publike hatred. What, for kindling coales of queſtions and controuerſies about Religion? Forſooth, not ſo: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if they might haue equall and indifferent dealing, if credit might be giuen to their faithfull aduertiſements, the Crowne of their Kings ſhould bee no longer pinned to the Popes flie-flap; in France there ſhould bee no French exempted from ſubiection to the French King; cauſes of benefices or of matrimonie, ſhould bee no longer citable and ſummonable to the Romiſh Court; and the Kingdome ſhould bee no longer tributarie vnder the colour of annats, the firſt fruits of Benefices after the remooue or death of the Incumbent, and other like impoſitions.</p>
                  <p>But why doe I ſpeake ſo much in the behalfe of the French Proteſtants? The Lord Cardinall himſelfe quittes them of this blame, when he telleth vs this doctrine for the depoſing of Kings by the Popes mace or verge, had credit and authoritie through all France, vntill <hi>Caluins</hi> time. Doth not his Lordſhip vnder-hand confeſſe by theſe words, that Kings had beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies before <hi>Caluins</hi> time, the more diſhonoured, and the worſe ſerued? Item, that Proteſtants, whom his Lordſhip calls heretikes, by the light of holy Scripture made the world then and euer ſince to ſee the right of Kings, oppreſſed ſo long before? As for thoſe of the Low Countries, and the ſubiects of Swethland, I haue little to ſay of their caſe, becauſe it is not within ordinary compaſſe, and indeed ſerueth nothing to the purpoſe. Theſe Nations, beſides the cauſe of Religion, doe ſtand vpon certaine reaſons of State, which I will not here take vpon me like a Iudge to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine or to ſift.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iunius Brutus,</hi> Whom the Lord Cardinall obiecteth, is an author vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne; and perhaps of purpoſe patcht vp by ſome Romaniſt, with a wyly deceit to draw the reformed Religion into hatred with Chriſtian Princes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Buchanan</hi> I reckon and ranke among Poets, not among Diuines, claſſicall
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:23110:262"/>or common. If the man hath burſt out here and there into ſome tearmes of exceſſe, or ſpeach of bad temper; that muſt be imputed to the violence of his humour, and heate of his ſpirit, not in any wiſe to the rules and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of trew Religion, rightly by him conceiued before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Barclaius</hi> alledged by the Cardinall, meddles not with depoſing of Kings; but deals with diſavowing them for Kings, when they ſhal renounce the right of Royalty, and of their owne accord giue ouer the Kingdome. Now he that leaues it in the Kings choice, either to hold or to giue ouer his Crowne, leaues it not in the Popes power to take away the Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Gerſon</hi> obtruded by the Cardinal, we haue ſpoken ſufficiently before, Where it hath beene ſhewed how <hi>Gerſon</hi> is diſguiſed, masked, and peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Lordſhip. In briefe, I take not vpon me to iuſtifie and make good all the ſayings of particular authors: We glory (and well we may) that our religion affordeth no rules of rebellion; nor any diſpenſation to ſubiects for the oath of their allegiance; and that none of our Churches giue entertainement vnto ſuch monſtrous and abhominable principles of diſloyaltie.</p>
                  <p>If any of the French, otherwiſe perſwaded in former times,
<note place="margin">Richcrius.</note> now hauing altered and changed his iudgement, doth contend for the Soueraignty of Kings againſt Papall vſurpation: He doubtles, for winding himſelfe out of the Laborinth of an error ſo intricate &amp; pernicious, deſerueth great honour and ſpeciall praiſe: He is worthy to hold a place of dignity aboue the L. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall; who hath quitted and betrayed his former iudgement, which was holy and iuſt: Their motions are contrary, their markes are oppoſite: The one reclineth from euill to good, the other declineth from good to euill.</p>
                  <p>At laſt his Lordſhip commeth to the cloſe of his Oration, and bindes vp <q>his whole harangue with a feate wreath of praiſes, proper to his King. He ſtyles the King the eldeſt Sonne of the Church, a young ſhoot of the lilly, which King Salomon in all his Royaltie was not able to match. He leades vs by the hand into the pleaſant meadowes of Hiſtories, there to learne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very firſt ſight and view, That ſo long ſo oft as the Kings of France embraced vnion, and kept good tearmes of concord with Popes and the Apoſtolike See; ſo long as the ſpouſe of the Church was paſtured and fed among the lillies, all ſorts of ſpirituall and temporall graces abundantly ſhowred vpon their Crownes, and vpon their people: On the contrary, when they made any rent or ſeparation from the moſt holy See; then the lillies were pricked and almoſt choaked with ſharpe thornes; they beganne to droope, to ſtoope, and to beare their beautifull heads downe to the very ground, vnder the ſtrong flawes and guſts of boyſtrous windes and tempeſts.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>My anſwere to this flouriſhing cloſe and vpſhot, ſhall be no leſſe apert then apt. It ſauours not of good and faithfull ſeruice, to ſmooth and ſtroake the Kings head with a ſoft hand of oyled ſpeech, and in the meane time to take away the Crowne from his head, and to defile it with dirt. But let vs
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:23110:263"/>try the cauſe by euidence of Hiſtorie, yea by the voice and verdict of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; to ſee whether the glorious beauty of the French lillies hath beene at any time blaſted, and thereupon hath faded, by ſtarting aſide, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparation from the holy See. Vnder the raigne of King <hi>Philip</hi> the Faire, France was bleſſed with peace and proſperity, notwithſtanding ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious acts done againſt the Papall See, and contumelious crying quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by King <hi>Philip</hi> with the Pope. <hi>Lewis</hi> 12. in ranged battell defeated the armies of Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> 2. and his Confederates: proclaimed the ſaid Pope to be fallen from the Popedome: ſtamped certaine coynes and pieces of gold with a diſhonourable mot, euen to Rome it ſelfe, <hi>Rome is Babylon:</hi> yet ſo much was <hi>Lewis</hi> loued and honoured of his people, that by a peculiar title he was called, <hi>the Father of the Country.</hi> Greater bleſſings of God, greater outward peace and plenty, greater inward peace with ſpirituall and celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all treaſures, were neuer heaped vpon my Great Brittaine, then haue beene ſince my Great Brittaine became Great in the greateſt and chiefeſt reſpect of all; to wit, ſince my Great Brittaine hath ſhaken off the Popes yoke; ſince ſhe hath refuſed to receiue and to entertaine the Popes Legats, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to collect S. <hi>Peters</hi> tribute or <hi>Peter-pence;</hi> ſince the Kings of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, my Great Brittaine, haue not beene the Popes vaſſals to doe him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage for their Crowne, and haue no more felt the laſhings, the ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of baſe and beggarly Monkes. Of Holland, Zeland, and Friſeland, what neede I ſpeake? yet a word and no more. Were they not a kinde of naked and bare people, of ſmall value, before God lighted the torch of the Goſpel, and aduanced it in thoſe Nations? were they not an ill fedde and ſcragged people, in compariſon of the ineſtimable wealth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity (both in all military actions and mechanicall trades, in trafficke as merchants, in marting as men of warre, in long nauigation for diſcouerie) to which they are now rayſed and mounted by the mercifull bleſſing of God, ſince the darknes of Poperie hath beene ſcattered, and the bright Sunne of the Goſpel hath ſhined in thoſe Countryes? Behold the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Republique: Hath ſhee now leſſe beautie, leſſe glory, leſſe peace and proſperitie, ſince ſhe lately fell to bicker and contend with the Pope? ſince ſhe hath wrung out of the Popes hand, the one of his two ſwords? ſince ſhe hath plumed and ſhaked his Temporall dominion? On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; after the French Kings had honoured the Popes, with munificent graunts and gifts of all the cities and territories, lands and poſſeſſions, which they now hold in Italy, and the auncient Earledome of <hi>Auignon</hi> in France for an ouer-plus; were they not rudely recompenced, and homely handled by their moſt ingratefull fee-farmers and copy-holders? Haue not Popes forged a donation of <hi>Constantine,</hi> of purpoſe to blot out all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of <hi>Pepins</hi> and <hi>Charlemaignes</hi> donation? Haue they not vexed and troubled the State? haue they not whetted the ſonnes of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous againſt their owne Father, whoſe life was a patterne and example of innocencie? Haue they not by their infinite exactions, robbed and ſcoured
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:23110:263"/>the Kingdome of all their treaſure? Were not the Kings of France, driuen to ſtoppe their violent courſes by the pragmaticall ſanction? Did they not ſundry times interdict the Kingdome, degrade the Kings, ſolicite the neighbour-Princes to inuade and lay hold on the Kingdome, and ſtirre vp the people againſt the King, whereby a gate was opened to a world of troubles and parricides? Did not <hi>Rauaillac</hi> render this reaſon for his mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and horrible attempt, That King <hi>Henry</hi> had a deſigne to warre with God, becauſe he had a deſigne to take armes againſt his Holineſſe, who is God? This makes me to wonder, what mooued the L. Cardinall to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall the laſt ciuill warres and motions in <hi>France,</hi> in the ranke of examples of vnhappy ſeparation from the Pope, when the Pope himſelfe was the trumpetor of the ſame troubleſome motions. If the Pope had bene wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and offended by the French King, or his people, and the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> had been ſcourged with peſtilence, or famine, or ſome other calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by forraine enemies; it might haue beene taken in probabilitie, as a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God for ſome iniurie done vnto his Vicar: But his Holineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the roote, the ground, the maſter-workeman and artificer of all theſe miſchiefes; how can it be ſaid, that God puniſheth any iniurie done to the Pope? but rather that his Holineſſe doth reuenge his owne quarrell, and which is worſt of all, when his Holineſſe hath no iuſt cauſe of quarrell or offence. Now then; to exhort a Nation (as the L. Cardinall hath done) by the remembrance of former calamities, to curry fauour with the Pope, and to hold a ſtrict vnion with his Holineſſe, is no exhortation to beare the Pope any reſpect of loue, or of reuerence, but rather a rubbing of memory, and a calling to minde of thoſe grieuous calamities, whereof the Pope hath been the only occaſion. It is alſo a threatning and obtruding of the Popes terrible thunder-bolts, which neuer ſcorched nor parched any skinne, (except crauens and meticulous bodies) and haue brought many great ſhowres of bleſſings vpon my Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>France,</hi> if ſhe hath enioyed proſperity in the times of her good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with Popes, it is becauſe the Pope ſeekes the amity of Princes that are in proſperitie, haue the meanes to curbe his pretenſions, and to put him to ſome plunge. Kings are not in proſperity, becauſe the Pope holds amitie with Kings; but his Holineſſe vſeth all deuiſes, &amp; ſeeketh all meanes to haue amitie with Kings, becauſe he ſees them flouriſh &amp; ſayle with proſperous winds. The ſwallow is no cauſe, but a companion of the ſpring: the Pope is no worker of a Kingdoms felicity, but a wooer of kings when they ſit in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities lap: he is no founder, but a follower of their good fortunes. On the other ſide: let a Kingdome fall into ſome grieuous diſaſter or calamitie, let ciuill warres boile in the bowels of the Kingdom; ciuil wars no leſſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the State, then fearefull and grieuous to the people; who riſeth ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then the Pope, who ruſheth ſooner into the troubled ſtreames then the Pope, who thruſteth himſelfe ſooner into the heate of the quarrell then the Pope, who runneth ſooner to raiſe his gaine by the publike wrack then the
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:23110:264"/>Pope, and all vnder colour of a heart wounded and bleeding for the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoules? If the lawfull King happen to be foyled, to be oppreſſed, and thereupon the State by his fall to get a new maſter by the Popes practiſe; then the ſaid new maſter muſt hold the Kingdome as of the Popes free gift, and rule or guide the ſterne of the State at his becke, and by his inſtruction. If the firſt and right Lord, in deſpite of all the Popes fulminations and fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes, ſhall get the honourable day, and vpper hand of his enemies; then the holy Father with a cheerfull and pleaſant grace, yea with fatherly gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, opens the rich cabinet of his iewells, I meane the treaſurie of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, and falls now to dandle and cocker the King in his fatherly lap, whoſe throat if he could, he would haue cut not long before.</p>
                  <p>This peſtilent miſchiefe hath now a long time taken roote, and is growne to a great head in the Chriſtian world, through the ſecret, but iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God; by whom Chriſtian Kings haue beeneſmitten with a ſpirit of dizzineſſe: Chriſtian Kings, who for many aages paſt haue liued in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, without any ſound inſtruction, without any trew ſenſe and right feeling of their owne right and power, whileſt vnder a ſhadow of Religion and falſe cloake of pietie, their Kingdomes haue beene ouer-burdened, yea ouer-borne with tributes, and their Crownes made to ſtoope euen to miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable bondage. That God in whoſe hand the hearts of Kings are poiſed, and at his pleaſure turned as the water-courſes; that mighty God alone, in his good time, is able to rouze them out of ſo deepe a ſlumber, and to take order (their drowzy fits once ouer and ſhaken off with heroicall ſpirits) that Popes hereafter ſhall play no more vpon their patience, nor preſume to put bits and ſnaffles in their noble mouthes, to the binding vp of their power with weake ſcruples, like mighty buls lead about by litle children with a ſmall twiſted thred. To that God, that King of Kings I deuote my ſcepter; at his feet in all humblenes I lay downe my Crowne; to his holy decrees and commaunds I will euer be a faithfull ſeruant, and in his battels a faithfull champion. To conclude; in this iuſt cauſe and quarrell, I dare ſend the challenge, and will require no ſecond, to maintaine as a defendant of honour, that my brother-Princes and my ſelfe, whom God hath aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vpon the Throne of Soueraigne Maieſtie and ſupreame dignity, doe hold the Royall dignitie of his Maieſtie alone; to whoſe ſeruice, as a moſt humble homager and vaſſall, I conſecrate all the glory, honour, ſplendor, and luſtre of my earthly Kingdomes.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T did no ſooner pleaſe God to lighten his hand, and relent the violence of his deuouring Angel againſt the poore people of this Citie, but as ſoone did I reſolue to call this Parliament, and that for three chiefe and principall reaſons: The firſt whereof is, (and which of it ſelfe, although there were no more, is not onely a ſufficient, but a moſt full and neceſſary ground and reaſon for conuening of this Aſſembly) This firſt reaſon I ſay is, That you who are here preſently aſſembled to repreſent the Body of this whole Kingdome, and of all ſorts of people within the ſame, may with your owne eares heare, and that I out of mine owne mouth may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer vnto you the aſſurance of my due thankefulnes for your ſo ioyfull and generall applauſe to the declaring and receiuing of mee in this Seate (which GOD by my Birthright and lineall deſcent had in the fulneſſe of time prouided for me) and that, immediatly after it pleaſed God to call your late Soueraigne of famous memory, full of dayes, but fuller of immortall trophes of Honour, out of this tranſitorie life. Not that I am able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:23110:265"/>by wordes, or vtter by eloquence the viue Image of mine inward thankfulnes, but onely that out of mine owne mouth you may reſt aſſured to expect that meaſure of thankefulnes at my hands, which is according to the infinitenes of your deſerts, and to my inclination and abilitie for requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of the ſame. Shall I euer? nay, can I euer be able, or rather ſo vnable in memorie, as to forget your vnexpected readineſſe and alacritie, your euer memorable reſolution, and your moſt wonderfull coniunction and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of your hearts in declaring and embracing mee as your vndoubted and lawfull King and Gouernour? Or ſhall it euer bee blotted out of my minde, how at my firſt entrie into this Kingdome, the people of all ſorts rid and ran, nay rather flew to meet mee? their eyes flaming nothing but ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of affection, their mouthes and tongues vttering nothing but ſounds of ioy, their hands, feete, and all the reſt of their members in their geſtures diſcouering a paſſionate longing, and earneſtneſſe to meete and embrace their new Soueraigne. <hi>Quid ergo retribuam?</hi> Shall I allow in my ſelfe, that which I could neuer beare with in another? No I muſt plainely and freely confeſſe here in all your audiences, that I did euer naturally ſo farre miſlike a tongue to ſmoothe, and diligent in paying their creditors with lip pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and verball thankes, as I euer ſuſpected that ſort of people meant not to pay their debtors in more ſubſtantiall ſort of coyne. And therefore for expreſſing of my thankefulneſſe, I muſt reſort vnto the other two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of my conuening of this Parliament, by them in action to vtter my thankefulneſſe: Both the ſaid reaſons hauing but one ground, which is the deedes, whereby all the dayes of my life, I am by Gods grace to expreſſe my ſaid thankfulneſſe towards you, but diuided in this, That in the firſt of theſe two, mine actions of thankes, are ſo inſeparably conioyned with my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as they are in a maner become indiuidually annexed to the ſame: In the other reaſon, mine actions are ſuch, as I may either doe them, or leaue them vndone, although by Gods grace I hope neuer to be weary of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt: It is the bleſſings which God hath in my Perſon beſtowed vpon you all, wherein I proteſt, I doe more glorie at the ſame for your weale, then for any particular reſpect of mine owne reputation, or aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage therein.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt then of theſe bleſſings,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which God hath ioyntly with my Perſon ſent vnto you, is outward Peace: that is, peace abroad with all forreine neighbours: for I thanke God I may iuſtly ſay, that neuer ſince I was a King, I either receiued wrong of any other Chriſtian Prince or State, or did wrong to any: I haue euer, I praiſe God, yet kept Peace and amitie with all, which hath bene ſo farre tyed to my perſon, as at my comming here you are witneſſes I found the State embarqued in a great and tedious warre, and onely by mine arriuall here, and by the Peace in my Perſon, is now amitie kept, where warre was before, which is no ſmal
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:23110:265"/>bleſſing to a Chriſtian Common-wealth: for by Peace abroad with their neighbours the Townes flouriſh, the Merchants become rich, the Trade doeth encreaſe, and the people of all ſorts of the Land enioy free libertie to exerciſe themſelues in their ſeuerall vocations without perill or diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance. Not that I thinke this outward Peace ſo vnſeparably tyed to my Perſon, as I dare aſſuredly promiſe to my ſelfe and to you, the certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance thereof: but thus farre I can very well aſſure you and in the word of a King promiſe vnto you, That I ſhall neuer giue the firſt occaſion of the breach thereof, neither ſhall I euer be moued for any particular or priuate paſſion of mind to interrupt your publique Peace, except I be forced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, either for reparation of the honour of the Kingdom, or elſe by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie for the weale and preſeruation of the ſame: In which caſe, a ſecure and honourable warre muſt be preferred to an vnſecure and diſhonourable Peace: yet doe I hope by my experience of the by-paſt bleſſings of Peace, which God hath ſo long euer ſince my Birth beſtowed vpon mee, that hee wil not be weary to continue the ſame, nor repent him of his grace towards me, transferring that ſentence of King <hi>Dauids</hi> vpon his by-paſt victories of warre, to mine of Peace, That, <hi>that God who preſerued me from the deuouring iawes of the Beare and of the Lion, and deliuered them into my hands, ſhall alſo now grant me victory ouer that vncircumciſed Philistine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt although outward Peace be a great bleſſing;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> yet is it as farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to peace within, as Ciuill warres are more cruell and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall then warres abroad. And therefore the ſecond great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that GOD hath with my Perſon ſent vnto you, is Peace within, and that in a double forme. Firſt, by my deſcent lineally out of the loynes of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeuenth, is reunited and confirmed in mee the Vnion of the two Princely Roſes of the two Houſes of LANCASTER and YORKE, whereof that King of happy memorie was the firſt Vniter, as he was alſo the firſt ground-layer of the other Peace. The lamentable and miſerable euents by the Ciuill and bloody diſſention betwixt theſe two Houſes was ſo great and ſo late, as it need not be renewed vnto your memories: which, as it was firſt ſetled and vnited in him, ſo is it now reunited and confirmed in me, being iuſtly and lineally deſcended, not onely of that happie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, but of both the Branches thereof many times before. But the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of theſe two princely Houſes, is nothing comparable to the Vnion of two ancient and famous Kingdomes, which is the other inward Peace an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to my Perſon.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt craue your patiences for a little ſpace, to giue me leaue to diſcourſe more particularly of the benefits that doe ariſe of that Vnion which is made in my blood, being a matter that moſt properly belongeth to me to ſpeake of, as the head wherein that great Body is vnited. And firſt, if we were to looke no higher then to naturall and Phyſicall reaſons, we may eaſily be perſwaded of the great benefits that by that Vnion do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:23110:266"/>to the whole Iſland: for if twentie thouſand men be a ſtrong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, is not the double thereof, fourtie thouſand, a double the ſtronger Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie? If a Baron enricheth himſelfe with double as many lands as hee had before, is he not double the greater? Nature teacheth vs, that Mountaines are made of Motes, and that at the firſt, Kingdomes being diuided, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Towne or little Countie, as Tyrants or Vſurpers could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the poſſeſſion, a Segniorie apart, many of theſe little Kingdomes are now in proceſſe of time, by the ordinance of God, ioyned into great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, whereby they are become powerfull within themſelues to defend themſelues from all outward inuaſions, and their head and gouernour thereby enabled to redeeme them from forreine aſſaults, and puniſh pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate tranſgreſſions within. Do we not yet remember, that this Kingdome was diuided into ſeuen little Kingdomes, beſides Wales? And is it not now the ſtronger by their vnion? And hath not the vnion of Wales to England added a greater ſtrength thereto? Which though it was a great Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, was nothing comparable in greatneſſe and power to the ancient and famous Kingdome of Scotland. But what ſhould we ſticke vpon any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall appearance, when it is manifeſt that God by his Almightie proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath preordained it ſo to be? Hath not God firſt vnited theſe two Kingdomes both in Language, Religion, and ſimilitude of maners? Yea, hath hee not made vs all in one Iſland, compaſſed with one Sea, and of it ſelfe by nature ſo indiuiſible, as almoſt thoſe that were borderers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues on the late Borders, cannot diſtinguiſh, nor know, or diſcerne their owne limits? Theſe two Countries being ſeparated neither by Sea, nor great Riuer, Mountaine, nor other ſtrength of nature, but onely by little ſmall brookes, or demoliſhed little walles, ſo as rather they were diuided in apprehenſion, then in effect; And now in the end and fulneſſe of time vnited, the right and title of both in my Perſon, alike lineally deſcended of both the Crownes, whereby it is now become like a little World within it ſelfe, being intrenched and fortified round about with a naturall, and yet admirable ſtrong pond or ditch, whereby all the former feares of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are now quite cut off: The other part of the Iſland being euer before now not onely the place of landing to all ſtrangers, that was to make inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion here, but likewiſe moued by the enemies of this State by vntimely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, to make inforced diuerſion from their Conqueſts, for defending themſelues at home, and keeping ſure their backe-doore, as then it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which was the greateſt hinderance and let that euer my Predeceſſors of this Nation gat in diſturbing them from their many famous and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conqueſts abroad: What God hath conioyned then, let no man ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. I am the Husband, and all the whole Iſle is my lawfull Wife; I am the Head, and it is my Body; I am the Shepherd, and it is my flocke: I hope therefore no man will be ſo vnreaſonable as to thinke that I that am a Chriſtian King vnder the Goſpel, ſhould be a Polygamiſt and husband to two wiues; that I being the Head, ſhould haue a diuided and monſtrous
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:23110:266"/>Body; or that being the Shepheard to ſo faire a Flocke (whoſe fold hath no wall to hedge it but the foure Seas) ſhould haue my Flocke parted in two. But as I am aſſured, that no honeſt Subiect of whatſoeuer degree within my whole dominions, is leſſe glad of this ioyfull Vnion then I am; So may the friuolous obiection of any that would bee hinderers of this worke, which God hath in my Perſon already eſtabliſhed, bee eaſily anſwered, which can be none, except ſuch as are either blinded with Ignorance, or els tranſported with Malice, being vnable to liue in a well gouerned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and onely delighting to fiſh in troubled waters. For if they would ſtand vpon their reputation and priuiledges of any of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, I pray you was not both the Kingdomes Monarchies from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and conſequently could euer the Body bee counted without the Head, which was euer vnſeparably ioyned thereunto? So that as Honour and Priuiledges of any of the Kingdomes could not be diuided from their Soueraigne; So are they now confounded &amp; ioyned in my Perſon, who am equall and alike kindly Head to you both. When this Kingdome of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was diuided into ſo many little Kingdoms as I told you before; one of them behooued to eate vp another, till they were all vnited in one. And yet can <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> or <hi>Deuonſhire,</hi> which were of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> although their Kingdome was of longeſt durance, and did by Conqueſt ouercome diuers of the reſt of the little Kingdomes, make claime to Prioritie of Place or Honour before <hi>Suſſex, Eſſex,</hi> or other Shires which were conquered by them? And haue we not the like experience in the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compoſed of diuers Dutchies, and one after another conquered by the ſword? For euen as little brookes loſe their names by their running and fall into great Riuers, and the very name and memorie of the great Riuers ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp in the Ocean ſo by the coniunction of diuers little Kingdomes in one, are all theſe priuate differences and queſtions ſwallowed vp. And ſince the ſucceſſe was happie of the <hi>Saxons</hi> Kingdomes being conquered by the ſpeare of <hi>Bellona;</hi>

And although that ſince mine entry into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, I haue both by meeting with diuers of the Eccleſiaſtical Eſtate, and likewiſe by diuers Proclamations clearely declared my minde in points of Religion, yet doe I not thinke it amiſſe in this ſo ſolemne an Audience, I ſhould now take occaſion to diſcouer ſomewhat of the ſecrets of my heart in that matter: For I ſhall neuer (with Gods grace) bee aſhamed to make publike profeſſion thereof at all occaſions, leſt God ſhould bee aſhamed to profeſſe and allow mee before men and Angels, eſpecially leſt that at this time men might preſume further vpon the misknowledge of my meaning to trouble this Parliament of ours then were conuenient. At my firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, although I found but one Religion, and that which by my ſelfe is profeſſed, publikely allowed, and by the Law maintained: Yet found I ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Religion, beſides a priuate Sect, lurking within the bowels of this Nation. The firſt is the trew Religion, which by me is profeſſed, and by the Law is eſtabliſhed: The ſecond is the falſly called Catholikes, but trewly Papiſts: The third, which I call a ſect rather then Religion, is the <hi>Puritanes</hi> and <hi>Nouelists,</hi> who doe not ſo farre differ from vs in points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as in their confuſed forme of Policie and Paritie, being euer diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the preſent gouernment, &amp; impatient to ſuffer any ſuperiority, which maketh their ſect vnable to be ſuffred in any wel gouerned Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. But as for my courſe toward them, I remit it to my Proclamations made vpon that Subiect. And now for the Papiſts, I muſt put a difference betwixt mine owne priuate profeſſion of mine owne ſaluation, and my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike gouernment of the Realme for the weale and quietnes thereof. As for mine owne profeſſion, you haue me your Head now amongſt you of the ſame Religion that the body is of. As I am no ſtranger to you in blood, no more am I a ſtranger to you in Faith, or in the matters concerning the houſe
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:23110:267"/>of God. And although this my profeſſion be according to mine education, wherein (I thanke God) I ſucked the milke of Gods trewth, with the milke of my Nurſe: yet do I here proteſt vnto you, that I would neuer for ſuch a conceit of conſtancy or other preiudicate opinion, haue ſo firmly kept my firſt profeſſion, if I had not found it agreeable to all reaſon, and to the rule of my Conſcience. But I was neuer violent nor vnreaſonable in my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: I acknowledge the Romane Church to be our Mother Church, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though defiled with ſome infirmities and corruptions, as the Iewes were when they crucified Chriſt: And as I am none enemie to the life of a ſicke man, becauſe I would haue his bodie purged of ill humours; no more am I enemie to their Church, becauſe I would haue them reforme their errors, not wiſhing the downe throwing of the Temple, but that it might be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and cleanſed from corruption: otherwiſe how can they wiſh vs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if their houſe be not firſt made cleane? But as I would be loather to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe in the leaſt point of mine owne Conſcience for any worldly reſpect, then the fooliſheſt Preciſian of them all; ſo would I bee as ſory to ſtraight the politique Gouernement of the bodies and mindes of all my Subiectes to my priuate opinions: Nay, my minde was euer ſo free from perſecution, or thralling of my Subiects in matters of Conſcience, as I hope that thoſe of that profeſſion within this Kingdome haue a proofe ſince my comming, that I was ſo farre from encreaſing their burdens with <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> as I haue ſo much as either time, occaſion, or law could permit, lightened them. And euen now at this time haue I bene carefull to reuiſe and conſider deepely vpon the Lawes made againſt them, that ſome ouerture may be proponed to the preſent Parliament for clearing theſe Lawes by reaſon (which is the ſoule of the Law) in caſe they haue bene in times paſt further, or more rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly extended by Iudges, then the meaning of the Law was, or might tend to the hurt aſwell of the innocent as of guiltie perſons. And as to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of my Subiects which are of that profeſſion, I muſt diuide them into two rankes, Clerickes and Layickes; for the part of the Layicks, certainely I euer thought them farre more excuſable then the other ſort, becauſe that ſort of Religion containeth ſuch an ignorant, doubtfull, and implicit kinde of faith in the Layickes grounded vpon their Church, as except they doe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally beleeue whatſoeuer their Teachers pleaſe to affirme, they cannot be thought guilty of theſe particular points of hereſies and corruptions, which their Teachers doe ſo wilfully profeſſe. And againe I muſt ſubdiuide the ſame Layickes into two rankes, that is, either quiet and well minded men, peaceable Subiects, who either being old, haue retayned their firſt drunken in liquor vpon a certaine ſhamefaſtneſſe to be thought curious or changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Or being young men, through euill education haue neuer bene nurſed or brought vp, but vpon ſuch venim in place of wholeſome nutriment. And that ſort of people I would be ſorry to puniſh their bodies for the errour of their minds, the reformation whereof muſt onely come of God and the trew Spirit. But the other ranke of Layicks, who either through Curioſitie,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:23110:268"/>affectation of Noueltie, or diſcontentment in their priuat humours, haue changed their coates, onely to be factious ſtirrers of Sedition, and Pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the common wealth, their backwardneſſe in their Religion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a ground to me the Magiſtrate, to take the better heed to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and to correct their obſtinacie. But for the part of the Clerickes, I muſt directly ſay and affirme, that as long as they maintaine one ſpeciall point of their doctrine, and another point of their practiſe, they are no way ſufferable to remaine in this Kingdome. Their point of doctrine is that arrogant and ambitious Supremacie of their Head the Pope, whereby he not onely claimes to bee Spirituall head of all Chriſtians, but alſo to haue an Imperiall ciuill power ouer all Kings and Emperors, dethroning and decrowning Princes with his foot as pleaſeth him, and diſpenſing and diſpoſing of all Kingdomes and Empires at his appetite. The other point which they obſerue in continuall practiſe, is the aſſaſſinates and murthers of Kings, thinking it no ſinne, but rather a matter of ſaluation, to doe all actions of rebellion and hoſtilitie againſt their naturall Soueraigne Lord, if he be once curſed, his ſubiects diſcharged of their fidelitie, and his Kingdome giuen a prey by that three crowned Monarch, or rather Monſter their Head. And in this point, I haue no occaſion to ſpeake fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here, ſauing that I could wiſh from my heart, that it would pleaſe God to make me one of the members of ſuch a generall Chriſtian vnion in Religion, as laying wilfulneſſe aſide on both hands, wee might meete in the middeſt, which is the Center and perfection of all things. For if they would leaue, and be aſhamed of ſuch new and groſſe Corruptions of theirs, as themſelues cannot maintaine, nor denie to bee worthy of reformation, I would for mine owne part be content to meete them in the mid-way, ſo that all nouelties might be renounced on either ſide. For as my faith is the Trew, Ancient, Catholike and Apoſtolike faith, grounded vpon the Scriptures and expreſſe word of God: ſo will I euer yeeld all reuerence to antiquitie in the points of Eccleſiaſticall pollicy; and by that meanes ſhall I euer with Gods grace keepe my ſelfe from either being an hereticke in Faith, or ſchiſmatick in matters of Pollicie. But of one thing would I haue the Papiſts of this Land to bee admoniſhed, That they preſume not ſo much vpon my Lenitie (becauſe I would be loath to be thought a Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) as thereupon to thinke it lawfull for them dayly to encreaſe their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and ſtrength in this Kingdome, whereby if not in my time, at leaſt in the time of my poſteritie, they might be in hope to erect their Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. No, let them aſſure themſelues, that as I am a friend to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons if they be good ſubiects: ſo am I a vowed enemie, and doe denounce mortall warre to their errors: And that as I would be ſory to bee driuen by their ill behauiour from the protection and conſeruation of their bodies and liues, So will I neuer ceaſe as farre as I can, to tread downe their errors and wrong opinions. For I could not permit the encreaſe and growing of their Religion, without firſt betraying of my ſelfe, and mine owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:23110:268"/>Secondly, this whole Iſle, aſwell the part I am come from, as the part I remaine in, in betraying their Liberties, and reducing them to the former ſlauiſh yoke, which both had caſten off, before I came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: And thirdly, the libertie of the Crowne in my poſteritie, which I ſhould leaue againe vnder a new ſlauery, hauing found i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> left free to me by my Predeceſſors. And therefore would I wiſh all good Subiects that are deceiued with that corruption, firſt if they find any beginning of inſtinction in themſelues of knowledge and loue to the Trewth, to foſter the ſame by all lawfull meanes, and to beware of quenching the ſpirit that worketh within them; And if they can find as yet no motion tending that way, to be ſtudious to reade and conferre with learned men, and to vſe all ſuch meanes as may further their Reſolution, aſſuring themſelues, that as long as they are diſconformable in Religion from vs, they cannot bee but halfe my Subiects, bee able to doe but halfe ſeruice, and I to want the beſt halfe of them, which is their ſoules. And here haue I occaſion to ſpeake to you my Lords the Biſhops: For as you, my Lord of Durham, ſaid very learnedly to day in your Sermon, Correction without inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is but a Tyrannie: So ought you, and all the Clergie vnder you, to be more carefull, vigilant, and diligent then you haue bene, to winne Soules to God, aſwell by your exemplary life, as doctrine. And ſince you ſee how carefull they are, ſparing neither labour, paines, nor extreme perill of their perſons to diuert, (the Deuill is ſo buſie a Biſhop) yee ſhould bee the more carefull and wakefull in your charges. Follow the rule preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed you by S. <hi>Paul, Bee carefull to exhort and to instruct in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon:</hi> and where you haue beene any way ſluggiſh before, now waken your ſelues vp againe with a new diligence in this point, remitting the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to God, who calling them either at the ſecond, third, tenth or twelfth houre, as they are alike welcome to him, ſo ſhall they bee to mee his Lieutenant here.</p>
            <p>The third reaſon of my conuening of you at this time,
<note place="margin">The third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Parliament.</note> which contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſuch actions of my thankefulneſſe toward you, as I may either doe, or leaue vndone, yet ſhall with Gods grace euer preſſe to performe all the dayes of my life: It conſiſts in theſe two points; In making of Lawes at certaine times, which is onely at ſuch times as this in Parliament; or in the carefull execution thereof at all other times. As for the making of them, I will thus farre faithfully promiſe vnto you, That I will euer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the weale of the body, and of the whole Common-wealth, in making of good Lawes and conſtitutions, to any particular or priuate ends of mine, thinking euer the wealth and weale of the Common-wealth to bee my greateſt weale and worldly felicitie: A point wherein a lawfull King doeth directly differ from a Tyrant. But at this time I am onely thus farre to forewarne you in that point, That you beware to ſeeke the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of too many Lawes, for two eſpeciall reaſons: Firſt, becauſe <hi>In corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſsima
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:23110:269"/>Republica plurimae leges;</hi> and the execution of good Lawes is farre more profitable in a Common-wealth, then to burden mens memories with the making of too many of them. And next, becauſe the making of too many Lawes in one Parliament, will bring in confuſion, for lacke of leiſure wiſely to deliberate before you conclude: For the Biſhop ſaid well to day, That to Deliberation would a large time be giuen, but to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a greater promptneſſe was required. As for the execution of good Lawes, it hath bene very wiſely and honourably foreſeene and ordered by my predeceſſours in this Kingdome, in planting ſuch a number of Iudges, and all ſorts of Magiſtrates in conuenient places for the execution of the ſame: And therefore muſt I now turne mee to you that are Iudges and Magiſtrates vnder mee, as mine Eyes and Eares in this caſe. I can ſay none otherwiſe to you, then as <hi>Ezekias</hi> the good King of <hi>Iuda</hi> ſaid to their Iudges, <hi>Remember that the Thrones that you fit on are Gods, and neither yours nor mine:</hi> And that as you muſt be anſwerable to mee, ſo muſt both you and I be anſwerable to GOD, for the due execution of our Offices. That place is no place for you to vtter your affections in, you muſt not there hate your foe nor loue your friend, feare the offence of the greater partie or pity the miſerie of the meaner; yee muſt be blinde and not ſee diſtinctions of perſons, handleſſe, not to receiue bribes; but keepe that iuſt temper and mid-courſe in all your proceedings, that like a iuſt ballance ye may neither ſway to the right nor left hand. Three principall qualities are required in you; Knowledge, Courage, and Sinceritie: that you may diſcerne with knowledge, execute with courage, and doe both in vpright ſinceritie. And as for my part, I doe vow and proteſt here in the preſence of God, and of this honourable Audience, I neuer ſhall be wearie, nor omit no occaſion, wherein I may ſhew my carefulneſſe of the execution of good Lawes. And as I wiſh you that are Iudges not to be weary in your Office in doing of it; ſo ſhall I neuer be wearie, with Gods grace, to take account of you, which is properly my calling.</p>
            <p>And thus hauing tolde you the three cauſes of my conuening of this Parliament, all three tending onely to vtter my thankefulneſſe, but in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers formes, the firſt by word, the other two by action; I doe confeſſe that when I haue done and performed all that in this Speech I haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <hi>Inutilis ſeruus ſum:</hi> Inutile, becauſe the meaning of the word <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utilis</hi> in that place of Scripture is vnderſtood, that in doing all that ſeruice which wee can to God, it is but our due, and wee doe nothing to God but that which wee are bound to doe. And in like maner, when I haue done all that I can for you, I doe nothing but that which I am bound to doe, and am accomptable to God vpon the contrary: For I doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the ſpeciall and greateſt point of difference that is betwixt a rightfull King and an vſurping Tyrant is in this; That whereas the proude and ambitious Tyrant doeth thinke his Kingdome and people
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:23110:269"/>are onely ordeined for ſatisfaction of his deſires and vnreaſonable appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites; The righteous and iuſt King doeth by the contrary acknowledge himſelfe to bee ordeined for the procuring of the wealth and proſperitie of his people, and that his greateſt and principall worldly felicitie muſt conſift in their proſperitie. If you bee rich I cannot bee poore, if you bee happy I cannot but bee fortunate, and I proteſt that your welfare ſhall euer be my greateſt care and contentment: And that I am a Seruant it is moſt trew, that as I am Head and Gouernour of all the people in my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion who are my naturall vaſſals and Subiects, conſidering them in numbers and diſtinct Rankes; So if wee will take the whole People as one body and Maſſe, then as the Head is ordeined for the body and not the Body for the Head; ſo muſt a righteous King know himſelfe to bee ordeined for his people, and not his people for him: For although a King and people be <hi>Relata;</hi> yet can hee be no King if he want people and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. But there be many people in the world that lacke a Head, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will neuer bee aſhamed to confeſſe it my principall Honour to bee the great Seruant of the Common-wealth, and euer thinke the proſperitie thereof to be my greateſt felicitie, as I haue already ſaid.</p>
            <p>But as it was the whole Body of this Kingdome, with an vniforme aſſent and harmonie, as I tolde you in the beginning of my Speech, which did ſo farre oblige mee in good will and thankefulneſſe of requitall by their alacritie and readineſſe in declaring and receiuing mee to that place which God had prouided for mee, and not any particular perſons: (for then it had not bene the body) So is my thankefulneſſe due to the whole State. For euen as in matter of faults, <hi>Quod à multis peccatur, impunè peccatur:</hi> Euen ſo in the matter of vertuous and good deedes, what is done by the willing conſent and harmonie of the whole body, no particular perſon can iuſtly claime thankes as proper to him for the ſame. And therefore I muſt heere make a little Apologie for my ſelfe, in that I could not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the particular humours of euery perſon, that looked for ſome aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or reward at my hand ſince my entrie into this Kingdome. Three kinde of things were craued of mee: Aduancement to honour, Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to place of Credit about my Perſon, and Reward in matters of land or profit. If I had beſtowed Honour vpon all, no man could haue beene aduanced to Honour: for the degrees of Honour doe conſiſt in perfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome aboue their fellowes. If euery man had the like acceſſe to my Priuy or Bed-chamber, then no man could haue it, becauſe it cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all. And if I had beſtowed Lands and Rewards vpon euery man, the fountaine of my liberalitie would be ſo exhauſted and dried, as I would lacke meanes to bee liberall to any man. And yet was I not ſo ſparing, but I may without vaunting affirme that I haue enlarged my fauour in all the three degrees, towards as many and more then euer King of <hi>England</hi> did in ſo ſhort a ſpace: No, I rather craue your pardon that I haue beene
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:23110:270"/>ſo bountifull: for if the meanes of the Crowne bee waſted, I behoued then to haue recourſe to you my Subiects, and bee burdenſome to you, which I would bee lotheſt to bee of any King aliue. For as it is trew, that as I haue already ſaid, it was a whole Body which did deſerue ſo well at my hand, and not euery particular perſon of the people: yet were there ſome who by reaſon of their Office, credit with the people or otherwiſe, tooke occaſion both before, and at the time of my comming amongſt you, to giue proofe of their loue and affection towards me. Not that I am any way in doubt, that if other of my Subiects had beene in their places, and had had the like occaſion, but they would haue vttered the like good effects, (ſo generall and ſo great were the loue and affection of you all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mee:) But yet this hauing beene performed by ſome ſpeciall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I could not without vnthankfulneſſe but requite them accordingly. And therefore had I iuſt occaſion to aduance ſome in Honour, ſome to places of ſeruice about mee, and by rewarding to enable ſome who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued well of mee, and were not otherwiſe able to maintaine the rankes I thought them capable of, and others who although they had not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly deſerued before, yet I found them capable and worthy of place of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment and credit, and not able to ſuſtaine thoſe places for which I thought them fit, without my helpe. Two eſpeciall cauſes moued mee to be ſo open handed: whereof the one was reaſonable and honourable; but the other I will not bee aſhamed to confeſſe vnto you, proceeded of mine owne infirmitie. That which was iuſt and honourable, was: That being ſo farre beholding to the body of the whole State, I thought I could not refuſe to let runne ſome ſmall brookes out of the fountaine of my thankefulneſſe to the whole, for refreſhing of particular perſons that were members of that multitude. The other which proceeded out of mine owne infirmitie, was the multitude and importunitie of Sutors. But although reaſon come by infuſion in a maner, yet experience groweth with time and labour: And therefore doe I not doubt, but experience in time comming will both teach the particular Subiects of this Kingdome, not to be ſo importune and vndiſcreete in crauing: And mee not to be ſo eaſily and lightly mooued, in granting that which may be harmefull to my Eſtate, and conſequently to the whole Kingdome.</p>
            <p>And thus hauing at length declared vnto you my minde in all the points, for the which I called this Parliament: My concluſion ſhall onely now be to excuſe my ſelfe, in caſe you haue not found ſuch Eloquence in my Speech, as peraduenture you might haue looked for at my hands. I might, if I liſt, alledge the great weight of my Affaires and my continuall buſineſſe and diſtraction, that I could neuer haue leaſure to thinke vpon what I was to ſpeake, before I came to the place where I was to ſpeake: And I might alſo alledge that my firſt ſight of this ſo famous and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable an Aſſembly, might likewiſe breede ſome impediment. But
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:23110:270"/>leauing theſe excuſes, I will plainely and freely in my maner tell you the trew cauſe of it, which is; That it becommeth a King, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to vſe no other Eloquence then plainneſſe and ſinceritie. By plaineneſſe I meane, that his Speeches ſhould be ſo cleare and voyd of all ambiguitie, that they may not be throwne, nor rent aſunder in contrary ſences like the old Oracles of the Pagan gods. And by ſinceritie, I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that vprightneſſe and honeſtie which ought to be in a Kings whole Speeches and actions: That as farre as a King is in Honour erected aboue any of his Subiects, ſo farre ſhould he ſtriue in ſinceritie to be aboue them all, and that his tongue ſhould be euer the trew Meſſenger of his heart: and this ſort of Eloquence may you euer aſſuredly looke for at my hands.</p>

            <head>A SPEACH IN THE PARLIAMENT HOVSE, AS NEERE THE VERY WORDS AS COVLD BE GATHERED at the inſtant.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lords Spirituall and Temporall, and you the Knights and Burgeſſes of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, It was farre from my thoughts till ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lately before my comming to this place, that this Subiect ſhould haue bene mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred vnto mee, whereupon I am now to ſpeake. But now it ſo falleth out, That whereas in the preceding Seſſion of this Parliament, the principall occaſion of my Speach was, to thanke and congratulate all you of this Houſe, and in you, all the whole Common-wealth (as being the repreſentatiue body of the State) for your ſo willing, and louing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and embracing of mee in that place, which GOD and Nature by deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of blood, had in his owne time prouided for me: So now my Subiect is, to ſpeake of a farre greater Thankeſgiuing then before I gaue to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a farre greater perſon, which is to GOD, for the great and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Deliuery he hath at this time granted to me, and to you all, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the whole body of this Eſtate.</p>
            <p>I muſt therefore begin with this old and moſt approued Sentence of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, <hi>Miſericordia Dei ſupra omnia opera eius.</hi> For Almightie God did not furniſh ſo great matter to his glory by the Creation of this great World, as he did by the Redemption of the ſame. Neither did his generation of the little world in our old &amp; firſt Adam, ſo much ſet forth the praiſes of God in his Iuſtice and Mercy, as did our Regeneration in the laſt &amp; ſecond Adam.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="500" facs="tcp:23110:272"/>And now I muſt craue a little pardon of you. That ſince Kings are in the word of GOD it ſelfe called Gods, as being his Lieutenants and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents on earth, and ſo adorned and furniſhed with ſome ſparkles of the Diuinitie; to compare ſome of the workes of GOD the great KING, towards the whole and generall world, to ſome of his workes towards mee, and this little world of my Dominions, compaſſed and ſeuered by the Sea from the reſt of the earth. Foras GOD for the iuſt puniſhment of the firſt great ſinnes in the originall world, when the ſonnes of GOD went in to the daughters of men, and the cup of their iniquities of all ſorts was filled, and heaped vp to the full, did by a generall deluge and ouerflowing of waters, baptize the world to a generall deſtruction, and not to a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall purgation (onely excepted NOAH and his family, who did repent and beleeue the threatnings of GODS iudgement:) So now when the world ſhall waxe old as a garment, and that all the impieties and ſinnes that can be deuiſed againſt both the firſt and ſecond Table, haue and ſhall bee committed to the full meaſure; GOD is to puniſh the world the ſecond time by fire, to the generall deſtruction and not purgation thereof: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though as was done in the former to NOAH and his family by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; So ſhall all we that beleeue be likewiſe purged, and not deſtroyed by the fire. In the like ſort, I ſay, I may iuſtly compare theſe two great and fearefull <hi>Domeſ-dayes,</hi> wherewith GOD threatned to deſtroy mee and all you of this little world that haue intereſt in me. For although I confeſſe, as all mankinde, ſo chiefly Kings, as being in the higher places like the high Trees, or ſtayeſt Mountaines, and ſteepeſt Rockes, are moſt ſubiect to the dayly tempeſts of innumerable dangers; and I amongſt all other Kings haue euer bene ſubiect vnto them, not onely euer ſince my birth, but euen as I may iuſtly ſay, before my birth: and while I was yet in my mothers belly: yet haue I bene expoſed to two more ſpeciall and greater dangers then all the reſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt of them, in the Kingdome where I was borne, and paſſed the firſt part of my life: And the laſt of them here, which is the greateſt. In the former I ſhould haue bene baptized in blood, and in my deſtruction not onely the Kingdom wherein I then was, but ye alſo by your future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, ſhould haue taſted of my ruine: Yet it pleaſed GOD to deliuer mee, as it were from the very brinke of death, from the point of the dagger, and ſo to purge me by my thankefull acknowledgement of ſo great a benefite. But in this, which did ſo lately fall out, and which was a deſtruction pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared not for me alone, but for you all that are here preſent, and wherein no ranke, aage, nor ſexe ſhould haue bene ſpared; This was not a crying ſinne of blood, as the former, but it may well bee called a roaring, nay a thundring ſinne of fire and brimſtone, from the which GOD hath ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly deliuered vs all. What I can ſpeake of this, I know not: Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what can I not ſpeake of it? And therefore I muſt for horror ſay with the Poet, <hi>Vox faucibus haeret.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, in the crueltie of the Plot it ſelfe,
<note n="1" place="margin">The crucltie of the Plot.</note> wherein cannot be enough admired the horrible and fearefull crueltie of their deuice, which was not onely for the deſtruction of my Perſon, nor of my Wife and poſteritie onely, but of the whole body of the State in generall; wherein ſhould neither haue bene ſpared, or diſtinction made of yong nor of old, of great nor of ſmall, of man nor of woman: The whole Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the whole reuerend Clergie, Biſhops, and moſt part of the good Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, the moſt part of the Knights and Gentrie; yea, and if that any in this Societie were fauourers of their profeſſion, they ſhould all haue gone one way: The whole Iudges of the land, with the moſt of the Lawyers, and the whole Clerkes: And as the wretch himſelfe which is in the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, doeth confeſſe, it was purpoſely deuiſed by them, and concluded to be done in this houſe; That where the cruell Lawes (as they ſay) were made againſt their Religion, both place and perſons ſhould all be deſtroyed and blowne vp at once.
<note place="margin">Three wayes how mankind may come to death.</note> And then conſider therewithall the cruel fourme of that practiſe: for by three different ſorts in generall may mankinde be put to death.</p>
            <p>The firſt, by other men, and reaſonable creatures, which is leaſt cruell:
<note n="1" place="margin">By Man.</note> for then both defence of men againſt men may be expected, and likewiſe who knoweth what pitie God may ſtirre vp in the hearts of the Actors at the very inſtant? beſides the many wayes and meanes, whereby men may eſcape in ſuch a preſent furie.</p>
            <p>And the ſecond way more cruell then that,
<note n="2" place="margin">By vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> is by <hi>Animal</hi> and vnreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures: for as they haue leſſe pitie then men, ſo is it a greater horror and more vnnaturall for men to deale with them: But yet with them both reſiſtance may auaile, and alſo ſome pitie may be had, as was in the Lions, in whoſe denne <hi>Daniel</hi> was throwne; or that thankefull Lion, that had the Romane in his mercie.</p>
            <p>But the third, which is moſt cruel and vnmercifull of all,
<note n="3" place="margin">By inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things.</note> is the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by inſenſible and inanimate things, and amongſt them all, the moſt cruell are the two Elements of Water and Fire; and of thoſe two, the fire moſtraging and mercileſſe.</p>

<note n="2" place="margin">The ſmall ground the Conſpirators had to moue them.</note> how wonderfull it is when you ſhall thinke vpon the ſmall, or rather no ground, whereupon the practiſers were entiſed to inuent this Tragedie. For if theſe Conſpirators had onely bene bankrupt perſons, or diſcontented vpon occaſion of any diſgraces done vnto them; this might haue ſeemed to haue bene but a worke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge. But for my owne part, as Iſcarcely euer knew any of them, ſo cannot they alledge ſo much as a pretended cauſe of griefe: And the wretch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in hands doeth confeſſe, That there was no cauſe moouing him or
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:23110:273"/>them, but meerely and only Religion. And ſpecially that chriſtian men, at leaſt ſo called, Engliſhmen, borne within the Countrey, and one of the ſpecials of them my ſworne Seruant in an Honourable place, ſhould pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe the deſtruction of their King, his Poſterity, their Countrey and all: Wherein their following obſtinacie is ſo ioyned to their former malice, as the fellow himſelfe that is in hand, cannot be moued to diſcouer any ſignes or notes of repentance, except onely that he doeth not yet ſtand to auow, that he repents for not being able to performe his intent.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hirdly,
<note n="3" place="margin">Miraculous euent, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie.</note> the diſcouery hereof is not a little wonderfull, which would bee thought the more miraculous by you all, if you were aſwell acquainted with my naturall diſpoſition, as thoſe are who be neere about me: For as I euer did hold Suſpition to be the ſicknes of a Tyrant, ſo was I ſo farre vpon the other extremity, as I rather contemned all aduertiſements, or apprehenſions of practiſes. And yet now at this time was I ſo farre contrary to my ſelfe, as when the Letter was ſhewed to me by my Secretary, wherein a generall obſcure aduertiſement was giuen of ſome dangerous blow at this time, I did vpon the inſtant interpret and apprehend ſome darke phraſes therein, contrary to the ordinary Grammer conſtruction of them, (and in an other ſort then I am ſure any Diuine, or Lawyer in any Vniuerſitie would haue taken them) to be meant by this horrible forme of blowing vs vp all by Powder; And thereupon ordered that ſearch to be made, whereby the matter was diſcouered, and the man apprehended: whereas if I had apprehended or interpreted it to any other ſort of danger, no worldly prouiſion or preuention could haue made vs eſcape our vtter deſtruction.</p>
            <p>And in that alſo was there a wonderfull prouidence of God, that when the party himſelfe was taken, he was but new come out of his houſe from working, hauing his Fireworke for kindling ready in his pocket, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with as he confeſſeth, if he had bene taken but immediatly before when he was in the Houſe, he was reſolued to haue blowen vp himſelfe with his Takers.</p>
            <p>One thing for mine owne part haue I cauſe to thanke GOD in, That if GOD for our ſinnes had ſuffered their wicked intents to haue preuailed, it ſhould neuer haue bene ſpoken nor written in aages ſucceeding, that I had died ingloriouſly in an Ale-houſe, a Stews, or ſuch vile place, but mine end ſhould haue bene with the moſt Honourable and beſt company, and in that moſt Honourable and fitteſt place for a King to be in, for doing the turnes moſt proper to his Office. And the more haue We all cauſe to thanke and magnifie GOD for this his mercifull Deliuery; And ſpecially I for my part, that he hath giuen me yet once leaue, whatſoeuer ſhould come of me hereafter, to aſſemble you in this Honourable place; And here in this place, where our generall deſtruction ſhould haue bene, to magnifie and praiſe him for Our generall deliuery: That I may iuſtly now ſay of mine
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:23110:273"/>Enemies and yours, as <hi>Dauid</hi> doeth often ſay in the Pſalme, <hi>Inciderunt in foueam quam fecerunt.</hi> And ſince <hi>Scipio</hi> an Ethnick, led onely by the light of Nature, That day when he was accuſed by the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the people of <hi>Rome</hi> for miſpending and waſting in his <hi>Punick</hi> warres the Cities Treaſure, euen vpon the ſudden brake out with that diuerſion of them from that matter, calling them to remembrance how that day, was the day of the yeere, wherein God had giuen them ſo great a victory againſt <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and therefore it was fitter for them all, leauing other matters, to runne to the Temple to praiſe God for that ſo great deliuery, which the people did all follow with one applauſe: How much more cauſe haue we that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to beſtow this time in this place for Thankeſ-giuing to God for his great Mercy, though we had had no other errant of aſſembling here at this time? wherein if I haue ſpoken more like a Diuine then would ſeeme to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this place, the matter it ſelfe muſt plead for mine excuſe: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here commen to thanke God for a diuine worke of his Mercy, how can I ſpeake of this deliuerance of vs from ſo helliſh a practiſe, ſo well as in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Diuinitie, which is the direct oppoſite to ſo damnable an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? And therefore may I iuſtly end this purpoſe, as I did begin it with this Sentence, <hi>The Mercie of God is aboue all his workes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It reſteth now that I ſhould ſhortly informe you what is to bee done hereafter vpon the occaſion of this horrible and ſtrange accident. As for your part that are my faithfull and louing Subiects of all degrees, I know that your hearts are ſo burnt vp with zeale in this errant, and your tongues ſo ready to vtter your duetifull affections, and your hands and feete ſo bent to concurre in the execution thereof, (for which as I neede not to ſpurre you, ſo can I not but praiſe you for the ſame:) As it may very well be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the zeale of your hearts ſhall make ſome of you in your ſpeaches raſhly to blame ſuch as may bee innocent of this attempt; But vpon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part I wiſh you to conſider, That I would be ſorie that any being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of this practiſe, either domeſticall or forraine, ſhould receiue blame or harme for the ſame. For although it cannot be denied, That it was the onely blinde ſuperſtition of their errors in Religion, that led them to this deſperate deuice; yet doth it not follow, That all profeſſing that <hi>Romiſh</hi> religion were guiltie of the ſame. For as it is trew, That no other ſect of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, not excepting <hi>Turke, Iew,</hi> nor <hi>Pagan,</hi> no not euen thoſe of <hi>Calicute,</hi> who adore the deuill, did euer maintaine by the grounds of their religion, That it was lawfull, or rather meritorious (as the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholickes call it) to murther Princes or people for quarrell of Religion. And although particular men of all profeſſions of Religion haue beene ſome Theeues, ſome Murtherers, ſome Traitors, yet euer when they came to their end and iuſt puniſhment, they confeſſed their fault to bee in their nature, and not in their profeſſion, (Theſe <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholicks onely excepted:) Yet it is trew on the other ſide, that many honeſt men blinded peraduenture with ſome opinions of Popery, as if they be not ſound in the queſtions of the
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:23110:274"/>
               <hi>Reall preſence,</hi> or in the number of the Sacraments, or ſome ſuch Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtion: yet doe they either not know, or at leaſt not beleeue all the trew grounds of Popery, which is in deed <hi>The myſterie of iniquitie.</hi> And therefore doe we iuſtly confeſſe, that many Papiſts, eſpecially our forefathers, laying their onely truſt vpon CHRIST and his Merits at their laſt breath, may be, and often times are ſaued; deteſting in that point, and thinking the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cltie of Puritanes worthy of fire, that will admit no ſaluation to any Papiſt. I therefore thus doe conclude this point, That as vpon the one part ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honeſt men, ſeduced with ſome errors of Popery, may yet remaine good and faithfull Subiects: So vpon the other part, none of thoſe that trewly know and beleeue the whole grounds, and Schoole concluſions of their doctrine, can euer proue either good Chriſtians, or faithfull Subiects. And for the part of forraine Princes and States, I may ſo much the more acquite them, and their Miniſters of their knowledge and conſent to any ſuch villanie, as I may iuſtly ſay, that in that point I better know all Chriſtian Kings by my ſelfe, That no King nor Prince of Honour will euer abaſe himſelfe ſo much, as to thinke a good thought of ſo baſe and diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Treachery, wiſhing you therefore, that as God hath giuen me an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie Peace and Amitie, with all other Chriſtian Princes my neighbours (as was euen now very grauely told you by my L. Chancellor) that ſo you will reuerently iudge and ſpeake of them in this caſe. And for my part I would wiſh with thoſe ancient Philoſophers, that there were a Chriſtall window in my breſt, wherein all my people might ſee the ſecreteſt thoughts of my heart, for then might you all ſee no alteration in my minde for this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, further then in theſe two points. The firſt, Caution and warineſſe in gouernment, to diſcouer and ſearch out the myſteries of this wickedneſſe as farre as may be: The other, after due triall, Seueritie of puniſhment vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that ſhall bee found guilty of ſo deteſtable and vnheard of villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie. And now in this matter if I haue troubled your eares with an abrupt ſpeach, vndigeſted in any good methode or order; you haue to conſider that an abrupt, and vnaduiſed ſpeach doeth beſt become in the relation of ſo abrupt and vnorderly an accident.</p>
            <p>And although I haue ordained the proroguing of this Parliament vntil after Chriſtmas vpon two neceſſary reſpects: whereof the firſt is, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I nor my Councell can haue leiſure at this time both to take order for the Apprehenſion and triall of theſe Conſpiratours, and alſo to wait vpon the dayly affaires of the Parliament, as the Councell muſt doe: And the other reaſon is, the neceſſitie at this time of diuers of your preſences in your Shires that haue Charges and Commandements there. For as theſe wretches thought to haue blowen vp in a maner the whole world of this Iſland, euery man being now commen vp here, either for publike cauſes of Parliament, or elſe for their owne priuate cauſes in Law, or otherwiſe: So theſe Rebels that now wander through the Countrey, could neuer haue gotten ſo fit a time of ſafetie in their paſſage, or whatſoeuer vnlawfull Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:23110:274"/>as now when the Countrey by the foreſaid occaſions is in a maner left deſolate, and waſte vnto them. Beſides that, it may be that I ſhall deſire you at your next Seſſion, to take vpon you the Iudgement of this Crime: For as ſo extraordinary a Fact deſerues extraordinary Iudgement, So can there not I thinke (following euen their owne Rule) be a fitter Iudgement for them, then that they ſhould be meaſured with the ſame meaſure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they thought to meaſure vs: And that the ſame place and perſons, whom they thought to deſtroy, ſhould be the iuſt auengers of their ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall a Parricide: Yet not knowing that I will haue occaſion to meete with you my ſelfe in this place at the beginning of the next Seſſion of this Paliament, (becauſe if it had not been for deliuering of the Articles agreed vpon by the Commiſſioners of the Vnion, which was thought moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to be done in my preſence, where both Head and Members of the Parliament were met together, my preſence had not otherwiſe been requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite here at this time.) I haue therefore thought good for concluſion of this Meeting, to diſcourſe to you ſomewhat anent the trew nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a Parliament, which I will remit to your memories till your next ſitting downe, that you may then make vſe of it as occaſion ſhall bee miniſtred.</p>
            <p>For albeit it be trew, that at the firſt Seſſion of my firſt Parliament, which was not long after mine Entrie into this Kingdome, It could not become me to in orme you of any thing belonging to Law or State heere: (for all knowledge muſt either bee infuſed or acquired, and ſeeing the former ſort thereof is now with Prophecie ceaſed in the world, it could not be poſſible for me at my firſt Entry here, before Experience had taught it me, to be able to vnderſtand the particular myſteries of this State:) yet now that I haue reigned almoſt three yeeres amongſt you, and haue beene carefull to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue thoſe things that belong to the office of a King, albeit that Time be but a ſhort time for experience in others, yet in a King may it be thought a reaſonable long time, eſpecially in me, who, although I be but in a maner a new King heere, yet haue bene long acquainted with the office of a King in ſuch another Kingdome, as doeth neereſt of all others agree with the Lawes and cuſtomes of this State. Remitting to your conſideration to iudge of that which hath beene concluded by the Commiſſioners of the Vnion, wherein I am at this time to ſignifie vnto you, That as I can beare witneſſe to the foreſaid Commiſſioners, that they haue not agreed nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded therein any thing, wherein they haue not foreſeen as well the weale and commodity of the one Countrey, as of the other; So can they all beare mee record, that I was ſo farre from preſſing them to agree to any thing, which might bring with it any preiudice to this people; as by the contrary I did euer admoniſh them, neuer to conclude vpon any ſuch Vnion, as might cary hurt or grudge with it to either of the ſaid Nations: for the leauing of any ſuch thing, could not but be the greateſt hinderance that might be to ſuch an Action, which God by the lawes of Nature had proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:23110:275"/>to be in his owne time, and hath now in effect perfected in my Perſon, to which purpoſe my Lord Chancellour hath better ſpoken, then I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to relate.</p>
            <p>And as to the nature of this high Court of Parliament, It is nothing elſe but the Kings great Councell, which the King doeth aſſemble either vpon occaſion of interpreting, or abrogating old Lawes, or making of new, according as ill maners ſhall deſerue, or for the publike puniſhment of notorious euill doers, or the praiſe and reward of the vertuous and well deſeruers; wherein theſe foure things are to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> whereof this Court is compoſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> what matters are proper for it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to what end it is ordeined.</p>
            <p>And fourthly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> what are the meanes and wayes whereby this end ſhould bee brought to paſſe.</p>
            <p>As for the thing it ſelfe, It is compoſed of a Head and a Body: The Head is the King, the Body are the members of the Parliament. This Body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine is ſubdiuided into two parts; The Vpper and Lower Houſe: The Vpper compounded partly of Nobility, Temporall men, who are herita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Councellors to the high Court of Parliament by the honour of their Creation and Lands: And partly of Biſhops, Spirituall men, who are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the vertue of their place and dignitie Councellours, Life Renters, or <hi>Ad vitam</hi> of this Court. The other Houſe is compoſed of Knights for the Shire; and Gentry, and Burgeſſes for the Townes. But becauſe the number would be infinite for all the Gentlemen and Burgeſſes to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at euery Parliament, Therefore a certaine number is ſelected and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of that great Body, ſeruing onely for that Parliament, where their perſons are the repreſentation of that Body.</p>
            <p>Now the matters whereof they are to treate ought therefore to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and rather of ſuch matters as cannot well bee performed without the aſſembling of that generall Body, and no more of theſe generals nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then neceſſity ſhall require: for as <hi>in Corruptiſsima Republica ſunt plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimae leges:</hi> So doeth the life and ſtrength of the Law conſiſt not in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vp infinite and confuſed numbers of Lawes, but in the right inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation and good execution of good and wholeſome Lawes. If this be ſo then, neither is this a place on the one ſide for euery raſh and harebrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fellow to propone new Lawes of his owne inuention: nay rather I could wiſh theſe buſie heads to remember that Law of the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, That whoſoeuer came to propone a new Law to the people, behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued publikely to preſent himſelfe with a rope about his necke, that in caſe the Law were not allowed, he ſhould be hanged therwith. So warie ſhould men be of proponing Nouelties, but moſt of all not to propone any bitter or ſeditious Laws, which can produce nothing but grudges and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment betweene the Prince and his people. Nor yet is it on the other ſide a conuenient place for priuate men vnder the colour of general Lawes,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:23110:275"/>to propone nothing but their owne particular gaine, either to the hurt of their priuate neighbours, or to the hurt of the whole State in generall, which many times vnder faire and pleaſing Titles, are ſmoothly paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and ſo by ſtealth procure without conſideration, that the priuate mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them tendeth to nothing but either to the wrecke of a particular partie, or elſe vnder colour of publike benefite to pill the poore people, and ſerue as it were for a generall Impoſt vpon them for filling the purſes of ſome priuate perſons.</p>
            <p>And as to the end for which the Parliament is ordeined, being only for the aduancement of Gods glory, and the eſtabliſhment and wealth of the King and his people: It is no place then for particular men to vtter there their priuate conceipts, nor for ſatisfaction of their curioſities, and leaſt of all to make ſhew of their eloquence by tyning the time with long ſtudied and eloquent Orations: No, the reuerence of God, their King, and their Countrey being well ſetled in their hearts, will make them aſhamed of ſuch toyes, and remember that they are there as ſworne Councellours to their King, to giue their beſt aduiſe for the furtherance of his Seruice, and the floriſhing Weale of his Eſtate.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, if you will rightly conſider the meanes and wayes how to bring all your labours to a good end, you muſt remember, That you are heere aſſembled by your lawfull King to giue him your beſt aduiſes, in the matters propoſed by him vnto you, being of that nature, which I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told, wherein you are grauely to deliberate, and vpon your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces plainely to determine how farre thoſe things propounded doe agree with the weale, both of your King and of your Countrey, whoſe weales cannot be ſeparated. And as for my ſelfe, the world ſhall euer beare mee witneſſe, That I neuer ſhall propone any thing vnto you, which ſhall not as well tend to the weale publike, as to any benefite for me: So ſhall I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer oppone my ſelfe to that, which may tend to the good of the Common-wealth, for the which I am ordeined, as I haue often ſaid. And as you are to giue your aduiſe in ſuch things as ſhall by your King be propoſed: So is it on your part your dueties to propone any thing that you can after mature deliberation iudge to be needefull, either for theſe ends already ſpoken of, or otherwiſe for the diſcouery of any latent euill in the Kingdome, which peraduenture may not haue commen to the Kings eare. If this then ought to bee your graue maner of proceeding in this place, Men ſhould bee aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make ſhew of the quickneſſe of their wits here, either in taunting, ſcoffing, or detracting the Prince or State in any point, or yet in breaking ieſts vpon their fellowes, for which the Ordinaries or Ale-houſes are fitter places, then this Honourable and high Court of Parliament.</p>
            <p>In concluſion then ſince you are to breake vp, for the reaſons I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told you, I wiſh ſuch of you as haue any charges in your Countreys, to haſten you home for the repreſſing of the inſolencies of theſe Rebels, and apprehenſion of their perſons, wherin as I heartily pray to the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:23110:276"/>for your proſperous ſucceſſe: So doe I not doubt, but we ſhall ſhortly heare the good newes of the ſame; And that you ſhall haue an happie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and meeting here to all our comforts.</p>
            <q>Here the Lord Chancellor ſpake touching the proroguing of the Parliament: And hauing done, his Maiestie roſe againe, and ſaid,</q>
            <p>SInce it pleaſed God to graunt mee two ſuch notable Deliueries vpon one day of the weeke, which was Tueſday, and likewiſe one day of the Moneth, which was the fifth; Thereby to teach mee, That as it was the ſame deuill that ſtill perſecuted mee; So it was one and the ſame GOD that ſtill mightily deliuered mee: I thought it therefore not amiſſe, That the one and twentieth day of Ianuary, which fell to be vpon Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, ſhould bee the day of meeting of this next Seſſion of Parliament, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and aſſuring my ſelfe, that the ſame GOD, who hath now granted me and you all ſo notable and gracious a deliuerie, ſhall proſper all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires at that next Seſſion, and bring them to an happie concluſion. And now I conſider GOD hath well prouided it, that the ending of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath bene ſo long continued: For as for my owne part, I neuer had any other intention, but onely to ſeeke ſo farre my weale, and proſperitie, as might coniunctly ſtand with the flouriſhing State of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, as I haue often told you; So on the other part I confeſſe, if I had bene in your places at the beginning of this Parliament, (which was ſo ſoone after mine entry into this Kingdome, wherein ye could not poſſibly haue ſo perfect a knowledge of mine inclination, as experience ſince hath taught you,) I could not but haue ſuſpected, and miſ-interpreted diuers things, In the trying whereof, now I hope, by your experience of my behauiour and forme of gouernment, you are well ynough cleared, and reſolued.</p>

            <head>A SPEACH TO BOTH THE HOVSES OF PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT, DELIVERED IN THE GREAT CHAMBER AT WHITE-HALL, <hi>THE LAST DAY OF March</hi> 1607.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lords of the higher Houſe, and you Knights and Burgeſſes of the Lower houſe, All men at the beginning of a Feaſt bring foorth good Wine firſt, and after, worſe. This was the ſaying of the Gouernour of the Feaſt at <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galile,</hi> where CHRIST wrought his firſt miracle by changing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Wine. But in this caſe now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I am to ſpeake vnto you, I muſt follow that Gouernours rule, and not CHRISTS example, in giuing you the worſt and ſowreſt Wine laſt. For all the time of this long Seſſion of the Parliament you haue bene ſo fed and cloy'd, (ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially you of the Lower houſe) with ſuch banquets, and choiſe of delicate ſpeeches, and your eares ſo ſeaſoned with the ſweetneſſe of long precogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Orations; as this my Speach now in the breaking vp of this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, cannot but appeare vnto your taſte as the worſt Wine propoſed in the end of the Banquet, ſince I am onely to deliuer now vnto you mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without curious forme, ſubſtance without ceremonie, trewth in all ſinceritie. Yet conſidering the Perſon that ſpeaketh, the parties to whom I ſpeake, the matter whereof I meane to ſpeake; it fits better to vtter mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:23110:277"/>rather then wordes, in regard of the greatneſſe of my place who am to ſpeake to you, the grauitie of you the Auditorie, which is the high Court of Parliament; the weight of the matter, which concernes the ſecuritie and eſtabliſhment of this whole Empire, and litle world. Studied Orations and much eloquence vpon little matter is fit for the Vniuerſities, where not the Subiect which is ſpoken of, but the triall of his wit that ſpeaketh, is moſt commendable: but on the contrary, in all great Councels or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, feweſt wordes with moſt matter doeth become beſt, where the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of the great errands in hand, and not the praiſe of the perſon is moſt to bee looked vnto: like the garment of a chaſte woman, who is onely ſet forth by her naturall beautie, which is properly her owne: other deckings are but enſignes of an harlot that flies with borrowed feathers. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the conueniencie, I am forced hereunto by neceſſitie, my place calling me to action, and not leauing me to the libertie of contemplation, hauing alwayes my thoughts buſied with the publique care of you all, where eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you hauing but himſelfe, and his owne priuate to thinke of, are at more leiſure to make ſtudied ſpeeches. And therefore the matter which I deliuer you confuſedly as in a ſacke, I leaue it to you when you are in your chambers, and haue better leyſure then I can haue, to ranke them in order, euery one in their owne place.</p>
            <p>Thus much by way of Preface. But I proceed to the matter: Whereof I might ſay with <hi>S. Paul,</hi> I could ſpeake in as many tongues as you all, but I had rather ſpeake three wordes to edification, then talke all day without vnderſtanding. In vaine (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmist</hi>) doeth the builder build the houſe, or the watchman watch the Citie, vnleſſe the Lord giue his bleſſing thereunto. And in the New Teſtament S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That hee may plant, <hi>Apollo</hi> may water, but it is GOD onely that muſt giue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe. This I ſpeake, becauſe of the long time which hath beneſpent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Treatie of the Vnion. For my ſelfe, I proteſt vnto you all, When I firſt propounded the Vnion, I then thought there could haue bene no more queſtion of it, then of your declaration and acknowledgement of my right vnto this Crowne, and that as two Twinnes, they would haue growne vp together. The errour was my miſtaking; I knew mine owne ende, but not others feares: But now finding many croſſings, long diſputations, ſtrange queſtions, and nothing done; I muſt needs thinke it proceeds either of miſtaking of the errand, or elſe from ſome iealouſie of me the Propounder, that you ſo adde delay vnto delay, ſearching out as it were the very bowels of Curioſitie, and conclude nothing. Neither can I condemne you for being yet in ſome iealouſie of my intention in this matter, hauing not yet had ſo great experience of my behauiour and inclination in theſe few yeeres paſt, as you may peraduenture haue in a longer time hereafter, and not hauing occaſion to conſult dayly with my ſelfe, and heare mine owne opinion in all thoſe particulars which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated among you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="511" facs="tcp:23110:277"/>But here I pray you now miſtake mee not at the firſt, when as I ſeeme to finde fault with your delayes and curioſitie, as if I would haue you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue in an houres time, that which will take a moneths aduiſement: for you all know, that <hi>Rex est lex loquens;</hi> And you haue oft heard mee ſay, That the Kings will and intention being the ſpeaking Law, ought to bee <hi>Luce clarius:</hi> and I hope you of the Lower houſe haue the proofe of this my cleareneſſe by a Bil ſent you downe from the Vpper houſe within theſe few dayes, or rather few houres: wherein may very well appeare vnto you the care I haue to put my Subiects in good ſecuritie of their poſſeſſions for all poſterities to come. And therefore that you may clearely vnderſtand my meaning in that point, I doe freely confeſſe, you had reaſon to aduiſe at leaſure vpon ſo great a cauſe: for great matters doe cuer require great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation before they be well concluded. <hi>Deliberandum est diu quod ſtatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endum est ſemel.</hi> Conſultations muſt proceed <hi>lento pede,</hi> but the execution of a ſentence vpon the reſolution would be ſpeedie. If you will goe on, it matters not though you goe with leaden feet, ſo you make ſtill ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, and that there be no let or needleſſe delay, and doe not <hi>Nodum in ſcirpo quaerere.</hi> I am euer for the <hi>Medium</hi> in euery thing. Betweene fooliſh raſhneſſe and extreame length, there is a middle way. Search all that is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, but omit that which is idle, curious and vnneceſſary; otherwiſe there can neuer be a reſolution or end in any good worke.</p>
            <p>And now from the generall I wil deſcend to particulars, and wil onely for the eaſe of your memories diuide the matter that I am to ſpeake of, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to foure heads, by opening vnto you, Firſt, what I craue: Secondly, in what maner I deſire it: Thirdly, what commodities will enſue to both the Kingdomes by it: Fourthly, what the ſuppoſed inconueniencie may be that giues impediments thereunto.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, what I craue, I proteſt before GOD who knowes my heart, and to you my people before whom it were a ſhame to lie, that I claime nothing but with acknowledgement of my Bond to you; that as yee owe to me ſubiection and obedience: So my Soueraigntie obligeth mee to yeeld to you loue, gouernment and protection: Neither did I euer wiſh any happineſſe to my ſelfe, which was not conioyned with the happineſſe of my people. I deſire a perfect Vnion of Lawes and perſons, and ſuch a Naturalizing as may make one body of both Kingdomes vnder mee your King, That I and my poſteritie (if it ſo pleaſe God) may rule ouer you to the worlds ende; Such an Vnion as was of the Scots and Pictes in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and of the Heptarchie here in England. And for Scotland I auow ſuch an Vnion, as if you had got it by Conqueſt, but ſuch a Conqueſt as may be cemented by loue, the onely ſure bond of ſubiection or friendſhip: that as there is ouer both but <hi>vnus Rex,</hi> ſo there may be in both but <hi>vnus Grex &amp; vna Lex:</hi> For no more poſſible is it for one King to gouerne two Countreys <hi>Contiguous,</hi> the one a great, the other a leſſe, a richer and a poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, the greater drawing like an Adamant the leſſer to the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:23110:278"/>thereof, then for one head to gouerne two bodies, or one man to be husband of two wiues, whereof Chriſt himſelfe ſaid, <hi>Ab initio non fuit ſic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the generall Vnion you muſt obſerue two things: for I will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer my thoughts plainly vnto you; I ſtudy clearenes, not eloquence, And therefore with the olde Philoſopers, I would heartily wiſh my breſt were a tranſparent glaſſe for you all to ſee through, that you might looke into my heart, and then would you be ſatisfied of my meaning. For when I ſpeake of a perfect Vnion, I meane not confuſion of all things: you muſt not take from Scotland thoſe particular Priuiledges that may ſtand as well with this Vnion, as in England many particular cuſtomes in particular Shires, (as the Cuſtomes of Kent, and the Royalties of the Countie Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine of Cheſter) do with the Common Law of the Kingdome: for euery particular Shire almoſt, and much more euery Countie, haue ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular cuſtomes that are as it were naturally moſt fit for that people. But I meane of ſuch a generall Vnion of Lawes as may reduce the whole Iland, that as they liue already vnder one Monarch, ſo they may all bee gouerned by one Law: For I muſt needs confeſſe by that little experience I haue had ſince my comming hither, and I thinke I am able to prooue it, that the grounds of the Common Law of England, are the beſt of any Law in the world, either Ciuil or Municipall, and the fitteſt for this people. But as euery Law would be cleare and full, ſo the obſcuritie in ſome points of this our written Law, and want of fulneſſe in others, the variation of Caſes and mens curioſitie, breeding euery day new queſtions, hath enforced the Iudges to iudge in many Caſes here, by Caſes and preſidents, wherein I hope Lawyers themſelues will not denie but that there muſt be a great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie, and I am ſure all the reſt of you that are Gentlemen of other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions were long agoe wearie of it, if you could haue had it amended: For where there is varietie and vncertaintie although a iuſt Iudge may do right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet an ill Iudge may take aduantage to doe wrong; and then are all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men that ſucceede him, tied in a maner to his vniuſt and partiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions. Wherefore, leaue not the Law to the pleaſure of the Iudge, but let your Lawes be looked into: for I deſire not the aboliſhing of the Lawes, but onely the clearing and the ſweeping off the ruſt of them, and that by Parliament our Lawes might be cleared and made knowen to all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. Yea rather it were leſſe hurt, that all the approued Caſes were ſet downe and allowed by Parliament for ſtanding Lawes in all time to come: For although ſome of them peraduenture may bee vniuſt as ſet downe by corrupt Iudges; yet better it is to haue a certaine Law with ſome ſpots in it, nor liue vnder ſuch an vncertaine and arbitrarie Law, ſince as the prouerbe is, It is leſſe harme to ſuffer an inconuenience then a miſchiefe. And now may you haue faire occaſion of amending and poliſhing your Lawes, when Scotland is to bee vnited with you vnder them for who can blame Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to ſay, If you will take away our owne Lawes, I pray you giue vs a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and cleerer in place thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="513" facs="tcp:23110:278"/>But this is not poſſible to bee done without a fit preparation. Hee that buildeth a Ship, muſt firſt prouide the timber; and as Chriſt himſelfe ſaid, No man will build an houſe, but he will firſt prouide the materials: nor a wiſe King will not make warre againſt another, without he firſt makepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of money: and all great workes muſt haue their preparation: and that was my end in cauſing the Inſtrument of the Vnion to be made. Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a mariage: would he not bee thought abſurd that for furthering of a mariage betweene two friends of his, would make his firſt motion to haue the two parties be laid in bedde together, and performe the other turnes of mariage? muſt there not precede the mutuall ſight and acquaintance of the parties one with another, the conditions of the contract, and Ioincture to be talked of and agreed vpon by their friends, and ſuch other things as in order ought to goe before the ending of ſuch a worke? The vnion is an eternall agreement and reconciliation of many long bloody warres that haue beene betweene theſe two ancient Kingdomes. Is it the readieſt way to agree a priuate quarell betweene two, to bring them at the firſt to ſhake hands, and as it were kiſſe other, and lie vnder one roofe or rather in one bedde together, before that firſt the ground of their quarell be communed vpon, their mindes mitigated, their affections prepared, and all other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances firſt vſed, that ought to be vſed to proceed to ſuch a finall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Euery honeſt man deſireth a perfect Vnion, but they that ſay ſo, and admit no preparation thereto, haue <hi>mel in ore, fel in corde.</hi> If after your ſo long talke of Vnion in all this long Seſſion of Parliament, yee riſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out agreeing vpon any particular; what will the neighbour Princes iudge, whoſe eyes are all fixed vpon the concluſion of this Action, but that the King is refuſed in his deſire, whereby the Nation ſhould bee taxed, and the King diſgraced? And what an ill preparation is it for the mindes of Scotland toward the Vnion, when they ſhall heare that ill is ſpoken of their whole Nation, but nothing is done nor aduanced in the matter of the Vnion it ſelfe? But this I am glad was but the fault of one, and one is no number: yet haue your neighbours of Scotland this aduantage of you, that none of them haue ſpoken ill of you (nor ſhall as long as I am King) in Parliament, or any ſuch publique place of Iuditature. Conſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well, if the mindes of Scotland had not neede to be well prepared to perſwade their mutuall conſent, ſeeing you here haue all the great aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by the Vnion. Is not here the perſonall reſidence of the King, his whole Court and family? Is not here the ſeate of Iuſtice, and the fountaine of Gouernment? muſt they not be ſubiected to the Lawes of England, and ſo with time become but as Cumberland and Northumberland, and thoſe other remote and Northerne Shires? you are to be the husband, they the wife: you conquerours, they as conquered, though not by the ſword, but by the ſweet and ſure bond of loue. Beſides that, they as other Northerne Countreys will beſeldome ſeene and ſaluted by their King, and that as it were but in a poſting or hunting iourney.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="514" facs="tcp:23110:279"/>How little cauſe then they may haue of ſuch a change of ſo ancient a Monarchie into the caſe of priuate Shires, iudge rightly herein. And that you may be the more vpright Iudges, ſuppoſe your ſelues the Patients of whom ſuch ſentence ſhould be giuen. But what preparation is it which I craue? onely ſuch as by the entrance may ſhew ſomething is done, yet more is intended. There is a conceipt intertained, and a double iealouſie poſſeſſeth many, wherein I am miſiudged.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that this Vnion will be the <hi>Criſis</hi> to the ouerthrow of England, and ſetting vp of Scotland: England will then bee ouerwhelmed by the ſwarming of the Scots, who if the Vnion were effected, would raigne and rule all.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, my profuſe liberalitie to the Scottiſh men more then the Engliſh, and that with this Vnion all things ſhalbe giuen to them, and you turned out of all: To you ſhall bee left the ſweat and labour, to them ſhall bee giuen the fruite and ſweet; and that my forbearance is but till this Vnion may be gained. How agreeable this is to the trewth, Iudge you; And that not by my wordes, but by my Actions. Doe I craue the Vnion without exceptions? doe I not offer to binde my ſelfe and to reſerue to you, as in the Inſtrument, all places of Iudicature? doe I intend any thing which ſtandeth not with the equall good of both Nations? I could then haue done it, and not ſpoken of it: For all men of vnderſtanding muſt agree, that I might diſpoſe without aſſent of Parliament, Offices of Iudicature, and others, both Eccleſiaſticall and Temporall: But herein I did voluntarily offer by my Letters from Royſton to the Commiſſioners, to bind my Prerogatiue.</p>
            <p>Some thinke that I will draw the Scottiſh Nation hither, talking idlely of tranſporting of Trees out of a barren ground into a better, and of leane cattell out of bad paſture into a more fertile ſoile. Can any man diſplant you, vnleſſe you will? or can any man thinke that Scotland is ſo ſtrong to pull you out of your houſes? or doe you not thinke I know England hath more people, Scotland more waſt ground? So that there is roumth in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land rather to plant your idle people that ſwarme in London ſtreets, and other Townes, and diſburden you of them, then to bring more vnto you; And in caſes of Iuſtice, if I bee partiall to either ſide, let my owne mouth condemne me, as vnworthy to be your King.</p>
            <p>I appeale to your ſelues, if in fauour or Iuſtice I haue beene partiall: Nay, my intention was euer, you ſhould then haue moſt cauſe to praiſe my diſcretion, when you ſaw I had moſt power. If hitherto I haue done nothing to your preiudice, much leſſe meane I hereafter. If when I might haue done it without any breach of promiſe; Thinke ſo of mee, that much leſſe I will doe it, when a Law is to reſtraine me. I owe no more to the Scottiſh men then to the Engliſh. I was borne there, and ſworne here, and now raigne ouer both. Such particular perſons of the Scottiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as might claime any extraordinary merit at my handes, I haue already
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:23110:279"/>reaſonably rewarded, and I can aſſure you that there is none left, whom for I meane extraordinary to ſtraine my ſelfe further, then in ſuch ordinary benefit as I may equally beſtow without mine owne great hurt, vpon any Subiect of either Nation; In which caſe no Kings handes can euer befully cloſed. To both I owe Iuſtice and protection, which with Gods grace I ſhall euer equally ballance.</p>
            <p>For my Liberalitie, I haue told you of it heretofore: my three firſt yeeres were to me as a Chriſtmas, I could not then be miſerable: ſhould I haue bene ouerſparing to them? they might haue thought <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had forgotten his brethren, or that the King had beene drunke with his new Kingdome. But Suites goe not now ſo cheape as they were wont, neither are there ſo many fees taken in the Hamper and Pettibagge for the great Seale as hath beene. And if I did reſpect the Engliſh when I came firſt, of whom I was receiued with ioy, and came as in a hunting iourney, what might the Scottiſh haue iuſtly ſaid, if I had not in ſome meaſure dealt bountifully with them that ſo long had ſerued me, ſo farre aduentured themſelues with me, and beene ſo faithfull to mee. I haue giuen you now foure yeeres proofe ſince my comming, and what I might haue done more to haue rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Scottiſh nation you all know, and the longer I liue, the leſſe cauſe haue I to be acquainted with them, and ſo the leſſe hope of extraordinary fauour towards them: For ſince my comming from them I doe not alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die know the one halfe of them by face, moſt of the youth being now riſen vp to bee men, who were but children when I was there, and more are borne ſince my comming thence.</p>
            <p>Now for my lands and reuenues of my Crowne which you may thinke I haue diminiſhed, They are not yet ſo farre diminiſhed, but that I thinke no prince of Chriſtendome hath fairer poſſeſſions to his Crowne then yet I haue: and in token of my care to preſerue the ſame to my poſteritie for euer, the intaile of my lands to the Crowne hath beene long agoe offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto you: and that it is not yet done, is not my fault as you know. My Treaſurer here knoweth my care, and hath already in part declared it, and if I did not hope to treble my Reuenue more then I haue empai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, I ſhould neuer reſt quietly in my bed. But notwithſtanding my comming to the Crowne, with that extraordinarie applauſe which you all know, and that I had two Nations to bee the obiects of my libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, which neuer any Prince had here before; will you compare my gifts out of mine inheritance with ſome Princes here that had onely this Nation to reſpect, and whoſe whole time of reigne was litle longer then mine hath bene already? It will be found that their gifts haue farre ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mine, albeit as I haue already ſaid, they had nothing ſo great cauſe of vſing their liberalitie.</p>
            <p>For the maner of the Vnion preſently deſired, It ſtandeth in 3. parts:
<note place="margin">Secondly</note> The firſt, taking away of hoſtile Lawes: for ſince there can bee now no Warres betwixt you, is it not reaſon hoſtile Lawes ſhould ceaſe?
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:23110:280"/>For, <hi>deſiciente cauſa deſicit effectas.</hi> The King of England now cannot haue warres with the King of Scotland, therefore this failes of it ſelfe. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is communitie of Commerce. I am no ſtranger vnto you: for you all know I came from the loynes of your ancient Kings. They of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land be my Subiects as you are. But how can I bee naturall Liege Lord to you both, and you ſtrangers one to the other? Shall they which be of one alleagance with you, be no better reſpected of you, nor freer amongſt you, then Frenchmen and Spaniards? Since I am Soueraigne ouer both, you as Subiects to one King, it muſt needes follow that you conuerſe and haue Commerce together. There is a rumour of ſome ill dealings that ſhould be vſed by the Commiſſioners, Merchants of Scotland. They be heere in England, and ſhall remaine till your next meeting, and abide triall, to prooue themſelues either honeſt men or knaues.</p>
            <p>For the third point,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of Naturalization, All you agree that they are no Aliens, and yet will not allow them to bee naturall. What kinde of prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue will you make? But for the <hi>Poſtnati,</hi> your owne Lawyers and Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges at my firſt comming to this Crowne, informed me, there was a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the <hi>Antè</hi> and the <hi>Poſt nati</hi> of each Kingdome, which cauſed mee to publiſh a Proclamation, that the <hi>Poſt nati</hi> were Naturalized <hi>(Ipſo facto)</hi> by my Acceſſion to this Crowne. I doe not denie but Iudges may erre as men, and therefore I doe not preſſe you here to ſweare to all their reaſons. I onely vrge at this time the conueniencie for both Kingdomes, neither preſſing you to iudge nor to be iudged. But remember alſo it is as poſſible and likely your owne Lawyers may erre as the Iudges: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as I wiſh you to proceede herein ſo farre as may tend to the weale of both Nations; So would I haue you on the other part to beware to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace either my Proclamations or the Iudges, who when the Parliament is done, haue power to trie your lands and liues, for ſo you may diſgrace both your King and your Lawes. For the doing of any acte that may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure leſſe reuerence to the Iudges, cannot but breede a looſeneſſe in the Gouernement, and a diſgrace to the whole Nation. The reaſon that moſt mooues mee for ought I haue yet heard, that there cannot but bee a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the <hi>Antè nati</hi> and the <hi>Poſt nati,</hi> and that in the fauour of the laſt, is that they muſt bee neerer vnto you being borne vnder the preſent Gouernement and common Allegiance: but in point of conueniencie, there is no queſtion but the <hi>Poſt nati</hi> are more to bee reſpected: For if you would haue a perfect and perpetuall Vnion, that cannot be in the <hi>Antè nati,</hi> who are but few in compariſon of thoſe that ſhall be in all aages ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and cannot liue long. But in the <hi>Poſt nati</hi> ſhall the Vnion be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and liue euer aage after aage, which wanting a difference cannot but leaue a perpetuall marke of ſeparation in the worke of the Vnion: as alſo that argument of iealouſie will be ſo farre remooued in the caſe of the <hi>Poſt nati</hi> which are to reape the benefit in all ſucceeding aages, as by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary there will then riſe <hi>Pharaos</hi> which neuer knew <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> The Kings my
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:23110:280"/>Succeſſours, who beeing borne and bred heere, can neuer haue more occaſion of acquaintance with the Scottiſh Nation in generall, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Engliſh King that was before my time. Bee not therefore abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the flattering ſpeeches of ſuch as would haue the <hi>Ante nati</hi> preferred, alleadging their merit in my Seruice, and ſuch other reaſons which indeede are but Sophiſmes: For, my rewarding out of my Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of any particular men, hath nothing adoe with the generall acte of the Vnion, which muſt not regard the deſerts of priuate perſons, but the generall weale and conioyning of the Nations. Beſides that, the actuall Naturalizing, which is the onely point that is in your handes, is already graunted to by your ſelues to the moſt part of ſuch particular perſons as can haue any vſe of it heere: and if any other well deſeruing men were to ſue for it hereafter, I doubt not but there would neuer bee queſtion mooued among you for the granting of it. And therefore it is moſt euident, that ſuch diſcourſers haue <hi>mel in ore, fel in corde,</hi> as I ſaid before; carying an outward appearance of loue to the Vnion, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a contrary reſolution in their hearts. And as for limitations and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions, ſuch as ſhall by me be agreed vpon to be reaſonable and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary after you haue fully debated vpon them, you may aſſure your ſelues I will with indifferencie grant what is requiſite without partiall reſpect of Scotland. I am, as I haue often ſaid, borne and ſworne King ouer both Kingdomes; onely this farre let me entreat you, in debating the point at your next meeting, That yee be as ready to reſolue doubts as to mooue them, and to be ſatisfied when doubts are cleered.</p>
            <p>And as for Commodities that come by the Vnion of theſe Kingdoms, they are great and euident; Peace, Plentie, Loue, free Intercourſe and common Societie of two great Nations. All forreigne Kings that haue ſent their Ambaſſadours to congratulate with me ſince my comming, haue ſaluted me as Monarch of the whole Iſle, and with much more reſpect of my greatneſſe, then if I were King alone of one of theſe Realmes: and with what comfort doe your ſelues behold Iriſh, Scottiſh, Welſh, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, diuers in Nation, yet all walking as Subiects and ſeruants within my Court, and all liuing vnder the allegiance of your King, beſides the honour and luſtre that the encreaſe of gallant men in the Court of diuers Nations carries in the eyes of all ſtrangers that repaire hither? Thoſe confining places which were the Borders of the two Kingdomes, where heretofore much blood was ſhed, and many of your anceſtours loſt their liues; yea, that lay waſte and deſolate, and were habitations but for run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagates, are now become the Nauell or Vmbilick of both Kingdomes, planted and peopled with Ciuilitie and riches: their Churches begin to bee planted, their doores ſtand now open, they feare neither robbing nor ſpoiling: and where there was nothing before heard nor ſeene in thoſe parts but bloodſhed, oppreſſions, complaints and outcries, they now liue euery man peaceably vnder his owne figgetree, and all their
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:23110:281"/>former cryes and complaints turned onely into prayers to God for their King, vnder whom they enioy ſuch eaſe and happy quietneſſe. The Marches beyond and on this ſide Twede, are as fruitfull and as peaceable as moſt parts of England: If after all this there ſhall be a Sciſſure, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience will follow, iudge you.</p>
            <p>And as for the inconueniences that are feared on Englands part, It is alleadged, that the Scots are a populous Nation, they ſhall be harboured in our neſts, they ſhall be planted and flouriſh in our good Soile, they ſhall eate our commons bare, and make vs leane: Theſe are fooliſh and idle ſurmiſes. That which you poſſeſſe, they are not to enioy; by Law they cannot, nor by my partialitie they ſhall not: for ſet apart conſcience and honour, (which if I ſhould ſet apart indeede, I had rather wiſh my ſelfe to bee ſet apart and out of all being) can any man conclude either out of common reaſon or good policie, that I will preferre thoſe which perhaps I ſhall neuer ſee, or but by poſte for a moneth, before thoſe with whom I muſt alwayes dwell? Can they conquer or ouercome you with ſwarmes of people, as the Goths and the Vandals did <hi>Italy?</hi> Surely the world knowes they are nothing ſo populous as you are: and although they haue had the honour and good fortune neuer to be conquered, yet were they euer but vpon the defenſiue part, and may in a part thanke their hilles and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible paſſages that preſerued them from an vtter ouerthrow at the handes of all that pretended to conquer them. Or are they ſo very poore and miſerable in their owne habitations, that neceſſitie ſhould force them all to make incurſions among you?</p>
            <p>And for my part, when I haue two Nations vnder my gouernment, can you imagine I will reſpect the leſſer, and neglect the greater? would I not thinke it a leſſe euill and hazard to mee that the plague were at Northampton or Barwicke, then at London, ſo neere Weſtminſter, the Seat of my habitation, and of my wife and children? will not a man bee more carefull to quench the fire taken in his neereſt neighbours houſe, then if a whole Towne were a fire farre from him? You know that I am carefull to preſerue the woods and game through all England, nay, through all the Iſle: yet none of you doubts, but that I would be more offended with any diſorder in the Forreſt of Waltham, for ſtealing of a Stagge there, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as it were vnder my noſe, and in a manerioyneth with my garden, then with cutting of timber, or ſtealing of a Deare in any Forreſt of the North parts of Yorkeſhire or the Biſhopricke. Thinke you that I will preferre them that be abſent, leſſe powerfull, and farther off to doe me good or hurt, before you, with whom my ſecurity and liuing muſt be, and where I deſire to plant my poſterity? If I might by any ſuch fauours raiſe my ſelfe to a greatneſſe, it might bee probable: All I cannot draw, and to loſe a whole ſtate here to pleaſe a few there, were madneſſe. I neede ſpeake no more of this with proteſtations. Speake but of wit, it is not likely: and to doubt of my intention in this, were more then deuiliſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="519" facs="tcp:23110:281"/>For mine owne part, I offer more then I receiue, and conueniencie I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre before law, in this point. For, three parts, wherein I might hurt this Nation, by partiality to the Scots, you know doe abſolutely lie in my hands and power: for either in diſpoſition of rents, or whatſoeuer benefit, or in the preferring of them to any dignitie or office, ciuill or Eccleſiaſticall, or in calling them to the Parliament, it doeth all fully and onely lie within the compaſſe of my Prerogatiue, which are the parts wherein the Scottiſh men can receiue either benefite or preferment by the Vnion, and wherein for the care I haue of this people, I am content to binde my ſelfe with ſome reaſonable reſtrictions.</p>
            <p>As for the fourth part, the Naturalizing, which onely lieth in your hands; It is the point wherein they receiue leaſt benefit of any: for in that they can obteine nothing, but what they buy by their purſe, or acquire by the ſelfe ſame meanes that you doe. And as for the point of naturalizing, which is the point thought ſo fit, and ſo preciſely belonging to Parliament; not to ſpeake of the Common law, wherein as yet I can profeſſe no great knowledge, but in the Ciuill law wherein I am a little better verſed, and which in the point of Coniunction of Nations ſhould beare a great ſway, it being the Law of Nations; I will mainteine two principles in it, which no learned and graue Ciuilian will deny, as being clearely to be proued, both out of the text it ſelfe in many places, and alſo out of the beſt approued Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours and interpreters of that law; The one, that it is a ſpeciall point of the Kings owne Prerogatiue, to make Aliens Citizens, and <hi>donare Ciuitate;</hi> The other, that in any caſe wherein the Law is thought not to be cleare (as ſome of your ſelues doe doubt, that in this caſe of the <hi>poſtnati,</hi> the Law of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land doth not clearely determine) then in ſuch a queſtion wherein no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue Law is reſolute, <hi>Rexeſt Iudex,</hi> for he is <hi>Lex loquens,</hi> and is to ſupply the Law, where the Law wants, and if many famous hiſtories be to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, they giue the example for mainteining of this Law in the perſons of the Kings of England and France eſpecially, whoſe ſpeciall Prerogatiue they alleadge it to be. But this I ſpeake onely as knowing what belongeth to a King, although in this caſe I preſſe no further then that which may agree with your loues, and ſtand with the weale and conueniencie of both Nations.</p>
            <p>And whereas ſome may thinke this Vnion will bring preiudice to ſome Townes and Corporations within England; It may bee, a Merchant or two of Briſtow, or Yarmouth, may haue an hundred pounds leſſe in his packe: But if the Empire gaine, and become the greater, it is no matter: You ſee one Corporation is euer againſt another, and no priuate Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie can be ſet vp, but with ſome loſſe to another.</p>
            <p>For the ſuppoſed inconueniences riſing from Scotland, they are three.
<note place="margin">Fourth.</note> Firſt, that there is an euill affection in the Scottiſh Nation to the Vnion. Next, the Vnion is incompatible betweene two ſuch Nations. Thirdly, that the gaine is ſmal or none. If this be ſo, to what end do we talke of an Vnion?
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:23110:282"/>For proofe of the firſt point, there is alleadged an auerſeneſſe in the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Nation expreſſed in the Inſtrument, both in the preface and body of their Acte; In the preface, where they declare, That they will remaine an abſolute and free Monarchie; And in the body of the Acte, where they make an exception of the ancient fundamentall Lawes of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And firſt for the generall of their auerſenes, All the maine cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in your Lower-houſe ranne this whole Seſſion of Parliament with that opinion, That Scotland was ſo greedy of this Vnion, and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they ſhould receiue ſo much benefit by it, as they cared not for the ſtrictneſſe of any conditions, ſo they might attaine to the ſubſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And yet you now ſay, they are backwards and auerſe from the Vnion. This is a direct contradiction <hi>In adiecto:</hi> For how can they both be beggers and backwards, in one and the ſelfe ſame thing, at the ſame time?</p>
            <p>But for anſwere to the particulars, It is an old Schoole point, <hi>Eius est explicare, cuius est condere.</hi> You cannot interpret their Lawes, nor they yours; I that made them with their aſſent, can beſt expound them.</p>
            <p>And firſt I confeſſe, that the Engliſh Parliaments are ſo long, and the Scottiſh ſo ſhort, that a meane betweene them would doe well: For the ſhortneſſe of their continuing together, was the cauſe of their haſtie miſtaking, by ſetting theſe wordes of exception of fundamentall Lawes in the body of the Acte, which they onely did in preſſing to imitate word by word the Engliſh Inſtrument, wherein the ſame wordes be conteined in your Preface. And as to their meaning and interpretation of that word, I will not onely deliuer it vnto you out of mine owne conceipt, but as it was deliuered vnto mee by the beſt Lawyers of Scotland, both Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and other Lawyers, who were at the making thereof in Scotland, and were Commiſſioners here for performance of the ſame.</p>
            <p>Their meaning in the word of Fundamentall Lawes, you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue more fully hereafter, when I handle the obiection of the difference of Lawes: For they intend thereby onely thoſe Lawes whereby confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is auoyded, and their Kings deſcent mainteined, and the heritage of the ſucceſſion and Monarchie, which hath bene a Kingdome, to which I am in deſcent, three hundreth yeeres before CHRIST: Not meaning it as you doe, of their Common Law, for they haue none, but that which is called IVS REGIS: and their deſire of continuing a free Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, was onely meant, That all ſuch particular Priuiledges (whereof I ſpake before) ſhould not bee ſo confounded, as for want either of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, Law, or Order, they might fall in ſuch a confuſion, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like a naked Prouince, without Law or libertie vnder this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. I hope you meane not I ſhould ſet Garriſons ouer them, as the Spaniards doe ouer Sicily and Naples, or gouerne them by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, which are ſeldome found ſucceedingly all wiſe and honeſt men.</p>
            <p>This I muſt ſay for Scotland, and I may trewly vaunt it; Here I ſit and
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:23110:282"/>gouerne it with my Pen, I write and it is done, and by a Clearke of the Councell I gouerne Scotland now, which others could not doe by the ſword. And for their auerſenſſe in their heart againſt the Vnion, It is trew indeede, I proteſt they did neuer craue this Vnion of me, nor ſought it either in priuate, or the State by letters, nor euer once did any of that Nation preſſe mee forward or wiſh mee to accelerate that buſineſſe. But on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, they offered alwayes to obey mee when it ſhould come to them, and all honeſt men that deſire my greatneſſe haue beene thus minded, for the perſonall reuerence and regard they beare vnto my Perion, and any of my reaſonable and iuſt deſires.</p>
            <p>I know there are many <hi>Piggots</hi> amongſt them, I meane a number of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious and diſcontented particular perſons, as muſt be in all Common-wealths, that where they dare, may peraduenture talke lewdly enough: but no Scottiſh man euer ſpake dishonourably of England in Parliament. For here muſt I note vnto you the difference of the two Parliaments in theſe two Kingdomes; for there they muſt not ſpeake without the Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors leaue, and if any man doe propound or vtter any ſeditious or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely ſpeeches, he is ſtraight interrupted and ſilenced by the Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors authoritie: where as here, the libertie for any man to ſpeake what hee liſt, and as long as he liſt, was the onely cauſe he was not interrupted.</p>
            <p>It hath bin obiected, that there is a great Antipathy of the Lawes and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of theſe two Nations. It is much miſtaken: for Scotland hath no Common Law as here, but the Law they haue is of three ſorts.</p>
            <p>All the Lawe of Scotland for Tenures, Wards and Liueries, Seigniories and Lands, are drawen out of the Chauncerie of England, and for matters of equitie and in many things elſe, differs from you but in certaine termes: <hi>Iames</hi> the firſt, bred here in England, brought the Lawes thither in a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hand. The ſecond is Statute lawes, which be their Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein they haue power as you, to make and altar Lawes: and thoſe may be looked into by you, for I hope you ſhall be no more ſtrangers to that Nation. And the principall worke of this Vnion will be, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Statute Lawes of both Kingdomes. The third is the Ciuill Law: <hi>Iames</hi> the fift brought it out of France by eſtabliſhing the Seſſion there, according to the forme of the Court of Parliament of Fraunce, which he had ſeene in the time of his being there: who occupie there the place of Ciuill! udges in all matters of Plee or controuerſie, yet not to gouerne ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely by the Ciuill Law as in Fraunce. For if a man plead that the Law of the Nation is otherwiſe, it is a barre to the Ciuill, and a good Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor or Preſident, will oftentimes repell and put to ſilence an Argument that the Lawyers bring out of the Ciuill Law, where they haue a cleare ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in their owne Law. So as the Ciuil Law in Scotland is admitted in no other caſes, but to ſupply ſuch caſes wherein the Municipall Law is defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue. Then may you ſee it is not ſo hard a matter as is thought, to reduce that Countrey to bee vnited with you vnder this Law, which neither are
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:23110:283"/>ſubiect to the Ciuill Lawe, nor yet haue any olde Common Law of their owne, but ſuch as in effect is borrowed from yours. And for their Statute Lawes in Parliament, you may alter and change them as oft as occaſion ſhall require, as you doe here. It hath likewiſe beene obiected as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impediment, that in the Parliament of Scotland the King hath not anegatiue voice, but muſt paſſe all the Lawes agreed on by the Lords and Commons. Of this I can beſt reſolue you: for I am the eldeſt Parliament man in Scotland, and haue ſit in more Parliaments then any of my Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. I can aſſure you, that the forme of Parliament there, is nothing inclined to popularitie. About a twentie dayes or ſuch a time before the Parliament, Proclamation is made throughout the Kingdome, to deliuer in to the Kings Clearke of Regiſter (whom you heere call the Maſter of the Rolles) all Bills to be exhibited that Seſſion before a certaine day. Then are they brought vnto the King, and peruſed and conſidered by him, and onely ſuch as I allowe of are put into the Chancellors handes to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to the Parliament, and none others; And if any man in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpeake of any other matter then is in this forme firſt allowed by mee, The Chancellor tells him there is no ſuch Bill allowed by the King.</p>
            <p>Beſides, when they haue paſſed them for lawes, they are preſented vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and I with my Scepter put into my hand by the Chancellor, muſt ſay, <hi>I ratifie and approue all things done in this preſent Parliament.</hi> And if there bee any thing that I diſlike, they raſe it out before. If this may bee called a negatiue voyce, then I haue one I am ſure in that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The laſt impediment is the French liberties: which is thought ſo great, as except the Scots farſake Fraunce, England cannot bee vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them. If the Scottiſh Nation would bee ſo vnwilling to leaue them as is ſaid, it would not lye in their hands: For the League was neuer made betweene the people, as is miſtaken, but betwixt the <hi>Princes</hi> onely and their Crownes. The beginning was by a Meſſage from a King of Fraunce, <hi>Charlemaine</hi> I take it (but I cannot certainely remember) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a King of Scotland, for a League defenſiue and offenſiue betweene vs and them againſt England, Fraunce being at that time in Warres with England.</p>
            <p>The like at that time was then deſired by England againſt Fraunce, who alſo ſent their Ambaſſadours to Scotland. At the firſt, the Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was long maintained in fauour of England, that they being our neereſt Neighbours ioyned in one continent, and a ſtrong and powerfull Nation, it was more fitte for the weale and ſecuritie of the State of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to be in League and Amitie with them, then with a Countrey, though neuer ſo ſtrong, yet diuided by Sea from vs: eſpecially Englandlying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs and them, where we might be ſure of a ſuddaine miſchiefe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooued to abide the hazard of wind and weather, and other accidents that might hinder our reliefe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="523" facs="tcp:23110:283"/>But after, when the contrary part of the Argument was maintained: wherein allegation was made, that England euer ſought to conquer Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and therefore in regarde of their pretended intereſt in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doome, would neuer keepe any ſound Amitie with them longer, then they ſaw their aduantage; whereas France lying more remote and clay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming no intereſt in the Kingdome, would therefore bee found a more conſtant and faithfull friend: It was vnhappily concluded in fauour of the laſt partie, through which occaſion Scotland gate many miſchiefes after: And it is by the very tenour thereof ordered, to bee renewed and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from King to King ſucceſſiuely, which accordingly was euer perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the mediation of their Ambaſſadours, and therefore meerely perſonall, and ſo was it renewed in the Queene my mothers time, onely betweene the two Kings, and not by aſſent of Parliament or conuention of the three Eſtates, which it could neuer haue wanted if it had beene a League betweene the people. And in my time when it came to be ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe it appeared to be in <hi>odium tertii,</hi> it was by me left vnrenewed or confirmed as a thing incompatible to my Perſon, in conſideration of my Title to this Crowne. Some Priuiledges indeede in the Merchants fauour for point of Commerce, were renewed and confirmed in my time: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for my part of it, there was ſcarce three Counſellours more then my Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie, to whoſe place it belonged, that medled in that matter.</p>
            <p>It is trew, that it behooued to be enterteined, as they call it, in the Court of Parliament of <hi>Paris:</hi> but that onely ſerues for publication, and not to giue it Authoritie: That Parliament (as you know) being but a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall Seate of Iudges and Lawyers, and nothing agreeing with the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition or office of our Parliaments in this Iſle. And therefore that any fruites or Priuiledges poſſeſſed by the League with Fraunce is able now to remaine in Scotland, is impoſſible: For ye may be ſure, that the French King ſtayes onely vpon the ſight of the ending of this Vnion, to cut it off himſelfe. Otherwiſe when this great worke were at an end, I would be forced for the generall care I owe to all my Subiects, to craue of France like Priuiledges to them all as Scotland alreadie enioyes, ſeeing the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall friendſhip remaines as great betweene vs as betweene our Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and all my Subiects muſt be alike deare vnto me: which either hee will neuer grant, and ſo all will fall to the ground; or elſe it will turne to the benefite of the whole Iſland: and ſo the Scottiſh Priuiledges cannot hold longer then my League with France laſteth.</p>
            <p>And for another Argument to prooue that this league is only betweene the Kings, and not betweene the people: They which haue Penſions, or are priuie Intelligence giuers in France without my leaue, are in no better caſe by the Law of Scotland, then if they were Penſioners to Spaine.</p>
            <p>As for the Scottiſh Guard in France, the beginning thereof was, when an Earle of <hi>Boghan</hi> was ſent in aide of the French with tenne thouſand men, and there being made Conſtable, and hauing obtained a victorie,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:23110:284"/>was murthered with the moſt of the Scottiſh Armie. In recompenſe whereof, and for a future ſecuritie to the Scottiſh Nation, the Scottiſh Guard was ordeined to haue the priuiledge and prerogatiue before all other Guards in guarding the Kings perſon.</p>
            <p>And as for the laſt point of this ſubdiuiſion concerning the gaine that England may make by this Vnion, I thinke no wiſe nor honeſt man will aske any ſuch queſtion. For who is ſo ignorant, that doeth not know the gaine will bee great? Doe you not gaine by the Vnion of Wales? And is not Scotland greater then Wales? Shall not your Dominions bee encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Landes, Seas, and perſons added to your greatneſſe? And are not your Landes and Seas adioyning? For who can ſet downe the limits of the Borders, but as a Mathematicall line or <hi>Idaea?</hi> Then will that backe doore bee ſhut, and thoſe portes of <hi>Ianus</hi> be for euer cloſed: you ſhall haue them that were your enemies to moleſt you, a ſure backe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you: their bodies ſhall bee your aides, and they muſt bee partners in all your quarrels: Two ſnow-balls put together, make one the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Two houſes ioyned, make one the larger: two Caſtle walles made in one, makes one as thicke and ſtrong as both. And doe you not ſee in the Low countreys how auaileable the Engliſh and the Scottiſh are being ioyned together? This is a point ſo plaine, as no man that hath wit or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie, but muſt acknowledge it feelingly.</p>
            <p>And where it is obiected that the Scottiſhmen are not tyed to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the King in the warres aboue forty dayes; It is an ignorant miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. For the trewth is, That in reſpect the Kings of Scotland did not ſo abound in Treaſure and money to take vp an Armie vnder pay, as the Kings of England did; Therefore was the Scottiſh Army wont to be ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed onely by Proclamation, vpon the penaltie of their breach of alleageance; So as they were all forced to come to the Warre like Snailes who carry their houſe about with them; Euery Nobleman and Gentleman bringing with him their Tents, money, prouiſion for their houſe, victuals of all ſorts, and all other neceſſaries, the King ſupplying them of nothing: Neceſſitie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon enforcing a warning to be giuen by the Proclamation of the ſpace of their attendance, without which they could not make their prouiſion accordingly, eſpecially as long as they were within the bounds of Scotland, where it was not lawfull for them to helpe themſelues by the ſpoile or waſting of the Countrey. But neither is there any Law Preſcribing preciſely ſuch a certaine number of dayes, nor yet is it without the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Kings power to keepe them together, as many more dayes as hee liſt, to renew his Proclamations from time to time ſome reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable number of dayes, before the expiring of the former, they being euer bound to ſerue and waite vpon him, though it were an hundreth yeere if need were.</p>
            <p>Now to conclude, I am glad of this occaſion, that I might <hi>Liberare ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam meam;</hi> You are now to recede: when you meete againe, remember
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:23110:284"/>I pray you, the trewth and ſincerity of my meaning, which in ſeeking Vnion, is onely to aduance the greatneſſe of your Empire ſeated here in England; And yet with ſuch caution I wiſh it, as may ſtand with the weale of both States. What is now deſired, hath oft before bene ſought when it could not bee obteined: To refuſe it now then, were double iniquitie. Strengthen your owne felicitie, <hi>London</hi> muſt bee the Seate of your King, and Scotland ioyned to this kingdome by a Golden conqueſt, but cymen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with loue, (as I ſaid before) which within will make you ſtrong againſt all Ciuill and inteſtine Rebellion, as without wee will bee compaſſed and guarded with our walles of braſſe. Iudge mee charitably, ſince in this I ſeeke your equall good, that ſo both of you might bee made fearefull to your Enemies, powerfull in your ſelues, and auaileable to your friendes. Studie therefore hereafter to make a good Concluſion, auoyd all delayes, cut off all vaine queſtions, that your King may haue his lawfull deſire, and be not diſgraced in his iuſt endes. And for your ſecuritie in ſuch reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble points of reſtrictions, whereunto I am to agree, yee need neuer doubt of my inclination: For I will not ſay any thing which I will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, nor promiſe any thing which I will notſweare; What I ſweare I will ſigne, and what I ſigne, I ſhall with GODS grace euer performe.</p>

            <head>A SPEACH TO THE LORDS AND COMMONS OF THE PARLIAMENT AT <hi>WHITE-HALL, ON WEDNESDAY THE</hi> XXI. OF MARCH. ANNO 1609.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E being now in the middeſt of this ſeaſon appointed for penitence and prayer, it hath ſo fallen out, that theſe two laſt dayes haue bene ſpent in a farre other ſort of exerciſe, I meane in Euchariſticke Sacrifice, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation of thankes, preſented vnto mee by both the parts of this body of Parliament: and therefore to make vp the number of three, (which is the number of Trinitie, and perfection) I haue thought good to make this the third Day, to be ſpent in this exerciſe.</p>
            <p>As ye made mee a faire Preſent indeed in preſenting your thankes and louing dueties vnto mee: So haue I now called you here, to recompence you againe with a great and a rare Preſent, which is a faire and a Chriſtall Mirror; Not ſuch a Mirror wherein you may ſee your owne faces, or ſhadowes; but ſuch a Mirror, or Chriſtall, as through the tranſparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof, you may ſee the heart of your King. The Philoſophers wiſh, That euery mans breaſt were a Chriſtall, where-through his heart might be ſeene, is vulgarly knowne, and I touched it in one of my former Speaches vnto you: But though that were impoſſible in the generall, yet will I now performe this for my part, That as it is a trew Axiome in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:23110:286"/>That <hi>Cor Regis</hi> is <hi>in manu Domini,</hi> So wil I now ſet <hi>Cor Regis in oculis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli.</hi> I know that I can ſay nothing at this time, whereof ſome of you that are here, haue not at one time or other, heard me ſay the like already: Yet as corporall food nouriſheth and mainteineth the body, ſo doeth <hi>Reminiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> nouriſh and mainteine memory.</p>
            <p>I Will reduce to three generall and maine grounds, the principall things that haue bene agitated in this Parliament, and whereof I will now ſpeake.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Arrand for which you were called by me; And that was, for ſupporting of my ſtate, and neceſſities.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, that which the people are to mooue vnto the King: To repreſent vnto him ſuch things, whereby the Subiects are vexed, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſtate of the Common wealth is to be redreſſed: And that is the thing which you call grieuances.</p>
            <p>The third ground that hath bene handled amongſt you, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in talke amongſt you in the Parliament, but euen in many other peoples mouthes, aſwell within, as without the Parliament, is of a higher nature then any of the former (though it be but an Incident?) and the reaſon is, becauſe it concernes a higher point; And this is a doubt, which hath bene in the heads of ſome, of my Intention in two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, whether I was reſolued in the generall, to continue ſtill my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment according to the ancient forme of this State, and the Lawes of this Kingdome: Or if I had an intention not to limit my ſelfe within thoſe bounds, but to alter the ſame when I thought conuenient, by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power of a King.</p>
            <p>The other branch is anent the Common Law, which ſome had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit I diſliked, and (in reſpect that I was borne where another forme of Law was eſtabliſhed) that I would haue wiſhed the Ciuill Law to haue bene put in place of the Common Law for gouernment of this people. And the complaint made amongſt you of a booke written by doctour <hi>Cowell,</hi> was a part of the occaſion of this incident: But as touching my cenſure of that booke, I made it already to bee deliuered vnto you by the Treaſurer here ſitting, which he did out of my owne directions and notes; and what he ſaid in my name, that had he directly from me: But what hee ſpake of himſelfe therein without my direction, I ſhal alwayes make good; for you may be ſure I will be loth to make ſo honeſt a man a lyer, or deceiue your expectations: alwayes within very few dayes my Edict ſhall come forth anent that matter, which ſhall fully diſcouer my meaning.</p>
            <p>There was neuer any reaſon to mooue men to thinke, that I could like of ſuch grounds: For there are two qualities principally, or rather priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that make Kings ſubiect to flatterie; <hi>Credulitie</hi> and <hi>Ignorance;</hi> and I hope none of them can bee iuſtly obiected to mee: For if <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, for all his learning, had bene wiſe in that point to haue conſidered the
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:23110:286"/>ſtate of his owne naturall body and diſpoſition, hee would neuer haue thought him ſelfe a god. And now to the matter. As it is a Chriſtan duety in euery man, <hi>Reddere rationem fidei,</hi> and not to be aſhamed to giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his profeſſion before men, and Angels, as oft as occaſion ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: So did I euer hold it a neceſſitie of honour in a iuſt and wiſe King, though not to giue an account to his people of his actions, yet clearely to deliuer his heart and intention vnto them vpon euery occaſion. But I muſt inuert my order, and begin firſt with that incident which was laſt in my diuiſion (though higheſt of nature) and ſo goe backward.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He State of MONARCHIE is the ſupremeſt thing vpon earth: For Kings are not onely GODS Lieutenants vpon earth, and ſit vpon GODS throne, but euen by GOD himſelfe they are called Gods. There bee three principall ſimilitudes that illuſtrate the ſtate of MONARCHIE: One taken out of the word of GOD; and the two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the grounds of Policie and Philoſophie. In the Scriptures Kings are called Gods, and ſo their power after a certaine relation compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Diuine power. Kings are alſo compared to Fathers of families: for a King is trewly <hi>Parens patriae,</hi> the politique father of his people. And laſtly, Kings are compared to the head of this Microcoſme of the body of man.</p>
            <p>Kings are iuſtly called Gods, for that they exerciſe a manner or reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Diuine power vpon earth: For if you wil conſider the Attributes to God, you ſhall ſee how they agree in the perſon of a King. God hath power to create, or deſtroy, make, or vnmake at his pleaſure, to giue life, or ſend death, to iudge all, and to bee iudged nor accomptable to none: To raiſe low things, and to make high things low at his pleaſure, and to God are both ſoule and body due. And the like power haue Kings: they make and vnmake their ſubiects: they haue power of raiſing, and caſting downe: of life, and of death: Iudges ouer all their ſubiects, and in all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and yet accomptable to none but God onely. They haue power to exalt low things, and abaſe high things, and make of their ſubiects like men at the Cheſſe; A pawne to take a Biſhop or a Knight, and to cry vp, or downe any of their ſubiects, as they do their money. And to the King is due both the affection of the ſoule, and the ſeruice of the body of his ſubiects: And therefore that reuerend Biſhop here amongſt you, though I heare that by diuers he was miſtaken or not wel vnderſtood, yet did he preach both lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly and trewly annent this point concerning the power of a King: For what he ſpake of a Kings power in <hi>Abſtracto,</hi> is moſt trew in Diuinitie: For to Emperors, or Kings that are Monarches, their Subiects bodies &amp; goods are due for their defence and maintenance. But if I had bene in his place, I would only haue added two words, which would haue cleared all: For after I had told as a Diuine, what was due by the Subiects to their Kings in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, I would then haue concluded as an Engliſhman, ſhewing this people,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:23110:287"/>That as in generall all Subiects were bound to relieue their King; So to exhort them, that as wee liued in a ſetled ſtate of a Kingdome which was gouerned by his owne fundamentall Lawes and Orders, that according thereunto, they were now (being aſſembled for this purpoſe in Parliament) to conſider how to helpe ſuch a King as now they had; And that according to the ancient forme, and order eſtabliſhed in this Kingdome: putting ſo, a difference betweene the generall power of a King in Diuinity, and the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and eſtabliſhed State of this Crowne, and Kingdome. And I am ſure that the Biſhop meant to haue done the ſame, if hee had not bene ſtraited by time, which in reſpect of the greatneſſe of the preſence preaching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, and ſuch an Auditory, he durſt not preſume vpon.</p>
            <p>As for the Father of a familie, they had of olde vnder the Law of Nature <hi>Patriam poteſtatem,</hi> which was <hi>Poteſtatem vitae &amp; necis,</hi> ouer their children or familie, (I meane ſuch Fathers of families as were the lineall heires of thoſe families whereof Kings did originally come:) For Kings had their firſt originall from them, who planted and ſpread themſelues in <hi>Colonies</hi> through the world. Now a Father may diſpoſe of his Inheritance to his children, at his pleaſure: yea, euen diſinherite the eldeſt vpon iuſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and preferre the youngeſt, according to his liking; make them beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or rich at his pleaſure; reſtraine, or baniſh out of his preſence, as hee findes them giue cauſe of offence, or reſtore them in fauour againe with the penitent ſinner: So may the King deale with his Subiects.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, as for the head of the naturall body, the head hath the power of directing all the members of the body to that vſe which the iudgement in the head thinkes moſt conuenient. It may apply ſharpe cures, or cut off corrupt members, let blood in what proportion it thinkes fit, and as the body may ſpare, but yet is all this power ordeined by God <hi>Ad aedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationem, non ad deſtructionem.</hi> For although God haue power aſwell of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as of creation or maintenance; yet will it not agree with the wiſedome of God, to exerciſe his power in the deſtruction of nature, and ouerturning the whole frame of things, ſince his creatures were made, that his glory might thereby be the better expreſſed: So were hee a fooliſh fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that would diſinherite or deſtroy his children without a cauſe, or leaue off the carefull education of them; And it were an idle head that would in place of phiſicke ſo poyſon or phlebotomize the body as might breede a dangerous diſtemper or deſtruction thereof.</p>
            <p>But now in theſe our times we are to diſtinguiſh betweene the ſtate of Kings in their firſt originall, and betweene the ſtate of ſetled Kings and Monarches, that doe at this time gouerne in ciuill Kingdomes: For euen as God, during the time of the olde Teſtament, ſpake by Oracles, and wrought by Miracles; yet how ſoone it pleaſed him to ſetle a <hi>Church</hi> which was bought, and redeemed by the blood of his onely Sonne <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then was there a ceſſation of both; Hee euer after gouerning his people and Church within the limits of his reueiledwill. So in the firſt originall of
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:23110:287"/>Kings, whereof ſome had their beginning by Conqueſt, and ſome by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the people, their wills at that time ſerued for Law; Yet how ſoone Kingdomes began to be ſetled in ciuilitie and policie, then did Kings ſet downe their minds by Lawes, which are properly made by the King one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but at the rogation of the people, the Kings grant being obteined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And ſo the King became to be <hi>Lex loquens,</hi> after a ſort, binding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by a double oath to the obſeruation of the fundamentall Lawes of his kingdome: <hi>Tacitly,</hi> as by being a King, and ſo bound to protect aſwell the people, as the Lawes of his Kingdome; And <hi>Expreſly,</hi> by his oath at his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation: So as euery iuſt King in a ſetled Kingdome is bound to obſerue that paction made to his people by his Lawes, in framing his gouernment agreeable thereunto, according to that paction which God made with <hi>Noe</hi> after the deluge, <hi>Hereafter Seed-time, and Harueſt, Cold and Heate, Summer and Winter, and Day and Night ſhall not ceaſe, ſo long as the earth remaines.</hi> And therefore a King gouerning in a ſetled Kingdome, leaues to be a King, and degenerates into a Tyrant, aſſoone as he leaues off to rule according to his Lawes. In which caſe the Kings conſcience may ſpeake vnto him, as the poore widow ſaid to Philip of Macedon; Either gouerne according to your Law, <hi>Aut ne Rexſis.</hi> And though no Chriſtian man ought to allow any rebellion of people againſt their Prince, yet doeth God neuer leaue Kings vnpuniſhed when they tranſgreſſe theſe limits: For in that ſame Pſalme where God ſaith to Kings, <hi>Vos Dij eſtis,</hi> hee immediatly thereafter concludes, <hi>But ye ſhall die like men.</hi> The higher wee are placed, the greater ſhall our fall be. <hi>Vt caſus ſic dolor:</hi> the taller the trees be, the more in danger of the winde; and the tempeſt beats ſoreſt vpon the higheſt mountaines. Therefore all Kings that are not tyrants, or periured, wil be glad to bound themſelues within the limits of their Lawes; and they that perſwade them the contrary, are vipers, and peſts, both againſt them and the Common-wealth. For it is a great difference betweene a Kings gouernment in a ſetled State, and what Kings in their originall power might doe in <hi>Indiuiduo vago.</hi> As for my part, I thanke God, I haue euer giuen good proofe, that I neuer had intention to the contrary: And I am ſure to goe to my graue with that reputation and comfort, that neuer King was in all his time more carefull to haue his Lawes duely obſerued, and himſelfe to gouerne thereafter, then I.</p>
            <p>I conclude then this point touching the power of Kings, with this Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome of Diuinitie, That as to diſpute what God may doe, is Blaſphemie; but <hi>quid vult Deus,</hi> that Diuines may lawfully, and doe ordinarily diſpute and diſcuſſe; for to diſpute <hi>A Poſſe ad Eſſe</hi> is both againſt Logicke and Diuinitie: So is it ſedition in Subiects, to diſpute what a King may do in the height of his power: But iuſt Kings wil euer be willing to declare what they wil do, if they wil not incurre the curſe of God. I wil not be content that my power be diſputed vpon: but I ſhall euer be willing to make the reaſon appeare of all my doings, and rule my actions according to my Lawes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="532" facs="tcp:23110:288"/>The other branch of this incident is concerning the Common Law, being conceiued by ſome, that I contemned it, and preferred the Ciuil Law thereunto. As I haue already ſaid, Kings Actions (euen in the ſecreteſt places) are as the actions of thoſe that are ſet vpon the Stages, or on the tops of houſes: and I hope neuer to ſpeake that in priuate, which I ſhall not auow in publique, and Print it if need be, (as I ſaid in my BASILICON DORON.) For it is trew, that within theſe few dayes I ſpake freely my minde touching the Common Law in my Priuie Chamber, at the time of my dinner, which is come to all your eares; and the ſame was likewiſe related vnto you by my Treaſurer, and now I will againe repeate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame my ſelfe vnto you. Firſt, as a King I haue leaſt cauſe of any man to diſlike the Common Law: For no Law can bee more fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and aduantagious for a King, and extendeth further his Prerogatiue, then it doeth: And for a King of England to deſpile the Common Law, it is to neglect his owne Crowne. It is trew, that I doe greatly eſteeme the Ciuill Law, the profeſſion thereof ſeruing more for generall learning and being moſt neceſſary for matters of Treatie with all forreine Nations: And I thinke that if it ſhould bee taken away, it would make an entrie to Barbariſme in this Kingdome, and would blemiſh the honour of England: For it is in a maner LEX GENTIVM, and maintaineth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with all forreme Nations: but I onely allow it to haue courſe here, according to thoſe limits of Iuriſdiction, which the Common Law it ſelfe doeth allow it: And therefore though it bee not fit for the generall gouernment of the people here; it doeth not follow, it ſhould be extinct, no more, then becauſe the Latine tongue is not the Mother or Radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Language of any Nation in the world at this time, that therefore the Engliſh tongue ſhould onely now be learned in this Kingdome, which were to bring in Barbariſme. My meaning therefore is not, to preferre the Ciuill Law before the Common Law; but onely that it ſhould not be extinguiſhed, and yet ſo bounded, (I meane to ſuch Courts and Cauſes) as haue beene in ancient vſe; As the Eccleſiaſticall Courts, Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miraltie, Court of Requeſts, and ſuch like, reſeruing euer to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law to meddle with the fundamentall Lawes of this Kingdome, either concerning the Kings Prerogatiue, or the poſſeſſions of Subiects, in any queſtions, either betweene the King, and any of them, or amongſt themſelues, in the points of <hi>Meum &amp; tuum.</hi> For it is trew, that there is no Kingdome in the world, not onely Scotland, but not France, nor Spaine, nor any other Kingdome gouerned meerely by the Ciuill Law, but euery one of them hath their owne municipall Lawes agreeable to their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, as this Kingdome hath the Common Law: Nay, I am ſo farre from diſallowing the Common Law, as I proteſt, that if it were in my hand to chuſe a new Law for this Kingdome, I would not onely preferre it before any other Nationall Law, but euen before the very Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Law of <hi>Moyſes:</hi> and yet I ſpeake no blaſphemie in preferring it for
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:23110:288"/>conueniencie to this Kingdome, and at this time, to the very Law of God: For God gouerned his ſelected people by theſe three Lawes, <hi>Ceremoniall, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> and <hi>Iudiciall:</hi> The <hi>Iudiciall,</hi> being onely fit for a certaine people, and a certaine time, which could not ſerue for the general of all other people and times. As for example, If the Law of hanging for Theft, were turned here to reſtitution of treble or quadruple, as it was in the Law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> what would become of all the middle Shires, and all the Iriſhrie and Highlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? But the maine point is, That if the fundamentall Lawes of any Kingdome ſhould be altered, who ſhould diſcerne what is <hi>Meum &amp; tuum,</hi> or how ſhould a King gouerne? It would be like the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Calender, which deſtroyes the old, and yet doeth this new trouble all the debts and Accompts of Traffiques and Merchandizes: Nay by that accompt I can neuer tell mine owne aage; for now is my Birth-day remooued by the ſpace often dayes neerer me then it was before the change. But vpon the other part, though I haue in one point preferred our Common Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our vſe to the very Law of GOD; yet in another reſpect I muſt ſay, both our Law and all Lawes elſe are farre inferiour to that Iudiciall Law of GOD; for no booke nor Law is perfect nor free from corruption, except onely the booke and Law of GOD. And therefore I could wiſh ſome three things ſpecially to be purged &amp; cleared in the Common Law; but alwayes by the aduiſe of Parliament: For the King with his Parliament here are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, (as I vnderſtand) in making or forming of any ſort of Lawes.</p>
            <p>Firſt I could wiſh that it were written in our vulgar Language: for now it is in an old, mixt, and corrupt Language, onely vnderſtood by Lawyers: whereas euery Subiect ought to vnderſtand the Law vnder which he liues: For ſince it is our plea againſt the Papiſts, that the language in GODS Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice ought not to be in an vnknowne tongue, according to the rule in the Law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> That the Law ſhould be written in the fringes of the Prieſts garment, and ſhould be publikely read in the eares of all the people: ſo mee thinkes ought our Law to be made as plaine as can be to the people, that the excuſe of ignorance may be taken from them, for conforming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thereunto.</p>
            <p>Next, our Common Law hath not a ſetled Text in all Caſes, being chiefly grounded either vpon old Cuſtomes, or elſe vpon the Reports and Caſes of Iudges, which ye call <hi>Responſa Prudentum.</hi> The like whereof is in all other Lawes: for they are much ruled by Preſidents (ſaue onely in <hi>Denmarke</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> where the letter of the Law reſolues all doubts without any trouble to the Iudge,) But though it be trew, that no Text of Law can be ſo certaine, wherein the circumſtances will not make a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation in the Caſe, (for in this aage, mens wits increaſe ſo much by ciuilitie, that the circumſtances of euery particular caſe varies ſo much from the generall Text of Law, as in the Ciuill Law it ſelfe, there are therefore ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Doctors that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment vpon the Text, &amp; neuer a one almoſt agrees with another; Otherwiſe there needed no Iudges, but the bare letter of the
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:23110:289"/>Law.) Yet could I wiſh that ſome more certaintie were ſet downe in this caſe by Parliament: for ſince the very Reports themſelues are not alwayes ſo binding, but that diuers times Iudges doe diſclaime them, and recede from the iudgment of their predeceſſors; it were good, that vpon a mature deliberation, the expoſition of the Law were ſet downe by Acte of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuch reports therein confirmed, as were thought fit to ſerue for Law in all times hereafter, and ſo the people ſhould not depend vpon the bare opinions of Iudges, and vncertaine Reports.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, there be in the Common Law diuers contrary Reports, and Preſidents: and this corruption doeth likewiſe concerne the Statutes and Acts of Parliament, in reſpect there are diuers croſſe and cuffing Statutes, and ſome ſo penned, as they may be taken in diuers, yea contrary ſences. And therefore would I wiſh both thoſe Statutes and Reports, aſwell in the Parliament as Common Law, to be once maturely reuiewed, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled; And that not onely all contrarieties ſhould be ſcraped out of our Bookes, but euen that ſuch penall Statutes as were made, but for the vſe of the time (from breach whereof no man can be free) which doe not now agree with the condition of this our time, might likewiſe beleft out of our bookes, which vnder a tyrannous or auaritious King could not be endured. And this reformation might (me thinkes) bee made a worthy worke, and well deſerues a Parliament to be ſet of purpoſe for it.</p>
            <p>I know now that being vpon this point of the Common Law, you looke to heare my opinion concerning <hi>Prohibitions;</hi> and I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that I haue bene thought to be an enemie to all <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> and an vtter ſtayer of them: But I will ſhortly now informe you what hath bene my courſe in proceeding therein. It is trew that in reſpect of diuers hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Courts, and Iuriſdictions planted in this Kingdome, I haue often wiſhed that euery Court had his owne trew limit, and iuriſdiction clearely ſet downe, and certainly knowne; which if it be exceeded by any of them, or that any of them encroch one vpon another, then I grant that a <hi>Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi> in that caſe is to goe out of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> but chieflieſt out of the <hi>Chancery;</hi> for other Benches I am not yet ſo well reſolued of their Iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that point. And for my part, I was neuer againſt <hi>Prohibitions</hi> of this nature, nor the trew vſe of them, which is indeed to keepe euery Riuer within his owne banks and channels. But when I ſaw the ſwelling and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflowing of <hi>Prohibitions</hi> in a farre greater abundance then euer before, euery Court ſtriuing to bring in moſt moulture to their owne Mill, by multitudes of Cauſes, which is a diſeaſe very naturall to all Courts and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions in the world; Then dealt I with this Cauſe, and that at two ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times, once in the middeſt of Winter, and againe in the middeſt of the next following Summer; At euery of which times I ſpent three whole daies in that labour. And then after a large hearing, I told them as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Mariage, <hi>Ab initio non fuit ſic.</hi> For as God conteins the Sea within his owne bounds and marches (as it is in the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi>) So is it my office to make
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:23110:289"/>euery Court conteine himſelfe within his own limits; And therfore I gaue admonitions to both ſides: To the other Courts, that they ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hereafter euery of them, to conteine themſelues within the bounds of their owne Iuriſdictions; and to the Courts of Common Law, that they ſhould not bee ſo forward, and prodigall in multiplying their <hi>Prohibitions.</hi> Two cautions I willed them to obſerue in graunting their <hi>Prohibitions:</hi> Firſt, that they ſhould be graunted in a right and lawfull forme: And next, that they ſhould not grant them, but vpon a iuſt and reaſonable cauſe. As to the forme, it was, That none ſhould be graunted by any one particular Iudge, or in time of Vacation, or in any other place, but openly in Court. And to this the Iudges themſelues gaue their willing aſſent. And as to the Cauſe, That they ſhould not be granted vpon euery ſleight furmiſe, or information of the partie, but alwayes that a due and graue examination ſhould firſt precede. Otherwiſe if <hi>Prohibitions</hi> ſhould raſhly, and headily be granted, then no man is the more ſecure of his owne, though hee hath gotten a Sentence with him: For as good haue no Law, or Sentence, as to haue no execution thereof. A poore Miniſter with much labour and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, hauing exhauſted his poore meanes, and being forced to forbeare his ſtudie, and to become <hi>non reſident</hi> from his flocke, obtaines a <hi>Sentence,</hi> and then when hee loookes to enioy the fruits thereof, he is defrauded of all by a <hi>Prohibition,</hi> according to the parable of Chriſt, That night when hee thinkes himſelfe moſt happy, ſhall his ſoule be taken from him: And ſo is he tortured like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> who when he hath the Apple at his mouth, and that he is gaping and opening his mouth to receiue it, then muſt it be pulled from him by a <hi>Prohibition,</hi> and he not ſuffered to taſte thereof. So as to conclude this point, I put a difference betweene the trew vſe of <hi>Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and the ſuperabounding abuſe thereof: for as a thing which is good, ought not therefore bee abuſed; ſo ought not the lawfull vſe of a good thing be forborne, becauſe of the abuſe thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow the ſecond generall ground whereof I am to ſpeake, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the matter of <hi>Grieuances:</hi> There are two ſpeciall cauſes of the peoples preſenting <hi>Grieuances</hi> to their King in time of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament. Firſt, for that the King cannot at other times be ſo well informed of all the <hi>Grieuances</hi> of his people, as in time of Parliament, which is the repreſentatiue body of the whole Realme. Secondly, the Parliament is the higheſt Court of Iuſtice, and therefore the fitteſt place where diuers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>Grieuances</hi> may haue their proper remedie, by the eſtabliſhment of good and wholſome Lawes. But though my Speech was before directed to the whole Body of Parliament; yet in this caſe I muſt addreſſe my Speech in ſpeciall to you of the Lower Houſe.</p>
            <p>I am now then to recommend vnto your conſiderations the matter and manner of your handling and preſenting of <hi>Grieuances.</hi> As for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, though I will not denie, but that yee, repreſenting the Body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:23110:290"/>may as it were both <hi>opportunè</hi> and <hi>inopportunè</hi> (I meane either in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament as a Body, or out of Parliament as priuate men) preſent your <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances</hi> vnto mee; yet would I haue you to vſe this caution in your beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in this point: which is, that your <hi>Grieuances</hi> be not as it were gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſought out by you, or taken vp in the ſtreetes (as one ſaid) thereby to ſhew a willingneſſe that you would haue a ſhew made, that there are many abuſes in the gouernment, and many cauſes of complaint: but that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your firſt inſtitution, ye ſhould only meddle with ſuch <hi>Grieuances,</hi> as your ſelues doe know had neede of reformation, or had informations thereof in your countreys for which you ſerue, and not ſo to multiply them, as might make it noiſed amongſt the people, that all things in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were amiſſe and out of frame: For euen at the beginning of this very Seſſion of Parliament, the generall name of <hi>Grieuances</hi> being mentioned among you, ſuch a conceipt came in the heads of many, that you had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to multiply and make a great muſter of them, as euery one exhibited what his particular ſpleene ſtirred him vnto. Indeed there fell out an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vpon this occaſion, for which I haue reaſon to thanke you of the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er houſe, I meane for your fire worke; wherein I confeſſe you did Honour to me, and right to your ſelues: For hauing one afternoone found many <hi>Grieuances</hi> cloſely preſented in papers, and ſo all thruſt vp in a ſacke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (rather like <hi>Paſquils,</hi> then any lawfull Complaints) farre againſt your owne Orders, and diuers of them proceeding from grudging and murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſpirits; you, vpon the hearing read two or three of the firſt lines of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of them, were not content with a publique conſent to condemne them, and to diſcharge any further reading of them, but you alſo made a publique bonefire of them. In this, I ſay, you ſhewed your care and ielou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of my Honour, and I ſent you thankes for it by the Chancellour of the Exchequer, a member of your owne Houſe, who by your appointment, that ſame night acquainted me with your proceedings; And by him alſo I promiſed at that time, that you ſhould heare more of my thankes for the ſame at the firſt occaſion; And now I tell you it my ſelfe, that you may know how kindely I take your duetifull behauiour in this caſe. But ſince this was a good effect of an euill cauſe, I muſt not omit alſo to admoniſh you vpon the other part, to take a courſe amongſt your ſelues, to preuent the like accident in all times hereafter: otherwiſe the Lower houſe may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a place for <hi>Paſquils,</hi> and at another time ſuch <hi>Grieuances</hi> may be caſt in amongſt you, as may conteine Treaſon or ſcandal againſt Me, or my Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Therfore in this caſe, looke ouer your ancient Orders, &amp; follow them, and ſuffer not hereafter any petitions or <hi>Grieuances</hi> to be deliuered obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or in the darke, but openly and auowedly in your Publique houſe, and there to be preſented to the Speaker. And as to the matter of your <hi>Grieuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> I wiſh you here now to vnderſtand me rightly. And becauſe I ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny writing and noting, I will craue your pardons, to holde you a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by ſpeaking the more diſtinctly, for feare of miſtaking.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="537" facs="tcp:23110:290"/>Firſt then, I am not to finde fault that you informe your ſelues of the particular iuſt <hi>Grieuances</hi> of the people; Nay, I muſt tell you, ye can neither be iuſt nor faithfull to me, or to your Countreys that truſt and imploy you, if you doe it not: For true Plaints proceede not from the perſons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, but from the Body repreſented, which is the people. And it may very well bee, that many Directions and Commiſſions iuſtly giuen forth by me, may be abuſed in the Execution thereof, vpon the people: and yet I neuer to receiue information, except it come by your meanes, at ſuch a time as this is; (as in the caſe of <hi>Stephen Procter.</hi>) But I would wiſh you to be carefull to auoide three things in the matter of <hi>Grieuances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, that you doe not meddle with the maine points of Gouernment; that is my craft: <hi>tractent fabrilia ſabri;</hi> to meddle with that, were to leſſon me: I am now an old King; for ſixe and thirtie yeeres haue I gouerned in <hi>Scotland</hi> perſonally, and now haue I accompliſhed my app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enticeſhip of ſeuen yeeres heere; and ſeuen yeeres is a great time for a Kings experience in Gouernment: Therefore there would not bee too many <hi>Phormios</hi> to teach <hi>Hannibal:</hi> I muſt not be taught my Office.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I would not haue you meddle with ſuch ancient Rights of mine, as I haue receiued from my Predeceſſors, poſſeſſing them, <hi>More Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iorum:</hi> ſuch things I would bee ſorie ſhould bee accounted for <hi>Grieuances.</hi> All nouelties are dangerous as well in a politique as in a naturall Body: And therefore I would be loth to be quarrelled in my ancient Rights and poſſeſſions: for that were to iudge mee vnworthy of that which my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors had, and left me.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, I pray you beware to exhibite for <hi>Grieuance</hi> any thing that is eſtabliſhed by a ſetled Law, and whereunto (as you haue already had a proofe) you know I will neuer giue a plauſible anſwere: For it is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifull part in Subiects to preſſe their King, wherein they know before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand he will refuſe them. Now, if any Law or Statute be not conuenient, let it be amended by Parliament, but in the meane time terme it not a <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance:</hi> for to be grieued with the Law, is to be grieued with the King, who is ſworne to bee the Patron and mainteiner thereof. But as all men are fleſh, and may erre in the execution of Lawes; So may ye iuſtly make a <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance</hi> of any abuſe of the Law, diſtinguiſhing wiſely betweene the faults of the perſon, and the thing it ſelfe. As for example, Complaints may be made vnto you of the high Commiſſioners: If ſo be, trie the abuſe, and ſpare not to complaine vpon it, but ſay not there ſhall be no Commiſſion, For that were to abridge the power that is in me: and I will plainely tell you. That ſomething I haue with my ſelfe reſolued annent that point, which I meane euer to keepe, except I ſee other great cauſe which is, That in regard the high Commiſſion is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſo high a nature, from which there is no appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to any other Court, I haue thought good to reſtraine it onely to the two Archbiſhops, where before it was common amongſt a great part of the Biſhops in England. This Law I haue ſet to my ſelfe, and therefore you
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:23110:291"/>may be aſſured, that I will neuer finde fault with any man, nor thinke him the more Puritane, that will complaine to me out of Parliament, aſwell as in Parliament, of any error in execution thereof, ſo that hee prooue it; Otherwiſe it were but a calumnie. Onely I would bee loath that any man ſhould grieue at the Commiſſion it ſelfe, as I haue already ſaid. Yee haue heard (I am ſure) of the paines I tooke both in the cauſes of the Admiralty, and of the Prohibitions: If any man therefore will bring me any iuſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints vpon any matters of ſo high a nature as this is, yee may aſſure your ſelues that I will not ſpare my labour in hearing it. In faith you neuer had a more painefull King, or that will be readier in his perſon to determine cauſes that are fit for his hearing. And when euer any of you ſhall make experience of me in this point, ye may be ſure neuer to want acceſſe, nor ye ſhall neuer come wrong to me, in, or out of Parliament.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude this purpoſe of <hi>Grieuances,</hi> I haue one generall <hi>grieuance</hi> to commend vnto you, and that in the behalfe of the Countreys from whence ye come. And this is, to pray you to beware that your <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances</hi> ſauour not of particular mens thoughts, but of the generall griefes riſing out of the mindes of the people, and not out of the humor of the propounder. And therefore I would wiſh you to take heede carefully, and conſider of the partie that propounds the <hi>grieuance:</hi> for ye may (if ye liſt) eaſily diſcerne whether it bee his owne paſſion, or the peoples griefe, that makes him to ſpeake: for many a man will in your houſe propound a <hi>Grieuance</hi> out of his owne humour, becauſe (peraduenture) he accounts highly of that matter: and yet the countrey that imployes him, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps either be of a contrary minde, or (at leaſt) little care for it. As for example, I aſſure you, I can very well ſmell betweene a Petition that mooues from a generall <hi>Grieuance,</hi> or ſuch a one as comes from the ſpleene of ſome particular perſon, either againſt Eccleſiaſticall gouernment in generall, or the perſon of any one Noble man, or Commiſſioner in particular.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd now the third point remaines to bee ſpoken of; which is the cauſe of my calling of this Parliament. And in this I haue done but as I vſe to doe in all my life, which is to leaue mine owne errand hindmoſt.</p>
            <p>It may bee you did wonder that I did not ſpeake vnto you publikely at the beginning of this Seſſion of Parliament, to tell you the cauſe of your calling, as I did (if I bee rightly remembred) in euery Seſſion before. But the trewth is, that becauſe I call you at this time for my particular Errand, I thought it fitter to bee opened vnto you by my Treaſurer, who is my publike and moſt principall Officer in matters of that nature, then that I ſhould doe it my ſelfe: for I confeſſe I am leſſe naturally eloquent, and haue greater cauſe to diſtruſt mine elocution in matters of this nature, then in any other thing. I haue made my Treaſurer already to giue you a very cleere and trew accompt both of my hauing and expenſes: A fauour I
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:23110:291"/>confeſſe, that Kings doe ſeldome beſtow vpon their Subiects, in making them ſo particularly acquainted with their ſtate. If I had not more then cauſe, you may be ſure I would be loth to trouble you: But what he hath affirmed in this, vpon the honour of a Gentleman, (whom you neuer had cauſe to diſtruſt for his honeſtie,) that doe I now confirme and auow to be trew in the word and honour of a King; And therein you are bound to beleeue me. Duetie I may iuſtly claime of you as my Subiects; and one of the branches of duetie which Subiects owe to their Soueraigne, is Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: but in what quantitie, and at what time, that muſt come of your loues. I am not now therefore to diſpute of a Kings power, but to tell you what I may iuſtly craue, and expect with your good wills. I was euer againſt all extremes; and in this caſe I will likewiſe wiſh you to auoyd them on both ſides. For if you faile in the one, I might haue great cauſe to blame you as Parliament men, being called by me for my Errands: And if you fall into the other extreme, by ſupply of my neceſſities without reſpectiue care to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd oppreſſion or partialitie in the Leuie, both I and the Countrey will haue cauſe to blame you.</p>
            <p>When I thinke vpon the compoſition of this body of Parliament, I doe well conſider that the Vpper houſe is compoſed of the Seculer Nobilitie, who are hereditary Lords of Parliament; and of Biſhops, that are liue Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Barons of the ſame: And therefore what is giuen by the Vpper houſe, is giuen onely from the trew body of that Houſe; and out of their owne purpoſes that doe giue it; whereas the Lower houſe is but the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue body of the Commons, and ſo what you giue, you giue it aſwell for others, as for your ſelues: and therefore you haue the more reaſon to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew both the extreames. On the one part, ye may the more eaſily be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, ſince it comes not all from your ſelues; and yet vpon the other part, if yee giue more then is fit for good and louing Subiects to yeeld vpon ſuch neceſſary occaſions, yee abuſe the King, and hurt the people; And ſuch a gift I will neuer accept: For in ſuch a caſe you might deceiue a King, in giuing your flattering conſent to that which you know might moue the people generally to grudge and murmure at it, and ſo ſhould the King find himſelfe deceiued in his <hi>Caloule,</hi> and the people likewiſe grieued in their hearts; the loue and poſſeſſion of which (I proteſt) I did, and euer will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt the greateſt earthly ſecuritie (next the fauour of GOD) to any wiſe or iuſt King. For though it was vainely ſaide by one of your Houſe, That yee had need to beware, that by giuing mee too much, your throats were not in danger of cutting at your comming home: yet may ye aſſure your ſelues, that I will euer bee lothe to preſſe you to doe that which may wrong the people, and make you iuſtly to beare the blame thereof. But that yee may the better bee acquainted with my inclination, I will appeale to a number of my Priuie Councell here preſent, if that before the calling of this Parliament, and when I found that the neceſſitie of my eſtate required ſo great a ſupply, they found me more deſirous to obtaine
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:23110:292"/>that which I was forced to ſeeke, then carefull that the people might yeeld me a ſupply in ſo great a meaſure as my neceſſities required, without their too great loſſe. And you all that are Parliament men, and here preſent of both Houſes can beare me witneſſe, if euer I burthened or imployed any of you for any particular Subſidies, or ſummes by name, further then my laying open the particular neceſſities of my ſtate, or yet if euer I ſpake to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Priuie Councellour, or any of my learned Councell, to labour voyces for me to this end; I euer deteſted the hunting for <hi>Emendicata Suffragia.</hi> A King that will rule and gouerne iuſtly, muſt haue regard to Conſcience, Honour and Iudgement, in all his great Actions, (as your ſelfe M. Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker remembred the other day.) And therefore ye may aſſure your ſelues, That I euer limitall my great Actions within that compaſſe. But as vpon the one ſide, I doe not deſire you ſhould yeeld to that extreame, in giuing me more then (as I ſaid formerly) vpon ſuch neceſſary occaſions are fit for good and louing Subiects to yeeld; For that were to giue me a purſe with a knife: So on the other ſide, I hope you will not make vaine pretences of wants, out of cauſeleſſe apprehenſions, or idle excuſes, neither cloake your owne humours (when your ſelues are vnwilling) by alledging the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie of the people. For although I will be no leſſe iuſt, as a King, to ſuch perſons, then any other: (For my Iuſtice with Gods grace, ſhalbe alike o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to all) yet ye muſt thinke I haue no reaſon to thanke them, or gratifie them with any ſuits or matters of grace, when their errand ſhall come in my way; And yet no man can ſay, that euer I quarrelled any man for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing mee a Subſidie, if hee did it in a moderate faſhion, and with good reaſons. For him that denies a good Law, I will not ſpare to quarrell: But for graunting or denying money, it is but an effect of loue: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the point of my neceſſities, I onely deſire that I be not refuſed in that which of duety I ought to haue: For I know if it were propounded in the generall amongſt you, whether the Kings wants ought to be relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or not, there is not one of you, that would make queſtion of it. And though in a ſort this may ſeeme to be my particular; yet it can not bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided from the generall good of the Common wealth; For the King that is <hi>Parens Patriae,</hi> telles you of his wants. Nay, <hi>Patria ipſa</hi> by him ſpeakes vnto you. For if the King want, the State wants, and therefore the ſtrengthening of the King is the preſeruation and the ſtanding of the State; And woe be to him that diuides the weale of the King from the weale of the Kingdome. And as that King is miſerable (how rich ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he bee) that raines ouer a poore people, (for the hearts and riches of the people, are the Kings greateſt treaſure;) So is that Kingdome not able to ſubſiſt, how rich and potent ſoeuer the people be, if their King wants meanes to mainaine his State: for the meanes of your King are the ſinewes of the kingdome both in warre and peace: for in peace I muſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter iuſtice vnto you, and in warre I muſt defend you by Armes: but neither of theſe can I do without ſufficient means, which muſt come from
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:23110:292"/>your Aide and Supply. I confeſſe it is farre againſt my nature to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome to my people: for it cannot but grieue me to craue of others, that was borne to be begged of. It is trew, I craue more then euer King of England did; but I haue farre greater and iuſter cauſe and reaſon to craue, then euer King of England had. And though my Treaſurer hath at length declared the reaſons vnto you of my neceſſities, and of a large ſupply that he craued for the ſame, wherein he omitted no arguments that can be vſed for that purpoſe; yet will I my ſelfe now ſhortly remember you ſome of the weightieſt reaſons that come in my head, to proue the equitie of my demaund.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ye all know, that by the acceſſion of more Crownes, which in my Perſon I haue brought vnto you, my charge muſt be the greater in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: For the greater your King be, both in his dominion and number of Subiects, he cannot but be forced thereby to be at the more charge, and it is the more your honour, ſo to haue it.</p>
            <p>Next, that poſteritie and iſſue which it hath pleaſed God to ſend me for your vſe, cannot but bring neceſſarily with it a greater proportion of charge. You all know that the late Queene of famous memory (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding her orbitie) had much giuen vnto her, and more then euer any of her predeceſſors had before her.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the time of creation of my Sonne doeth now draw neere, which I chuſe for the greater honour to bee done in this time of Parliament. As for him I ſay no more; the ſight of himſelfe here ſpeakes for him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it is trew I haue ſpent much; but yet if I had ſpared any of thoſe things, which cauſed a great part of my expenſe, I ſhould haue diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored the kingdome, my ſelfe, and the late Queene. Should I haue ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the funerall of the late Queene? or the ſolemnitie of mine and my wiues entrie into this Kingdome, in ſome honourable ſort? or ſhould I haue ſpared our entrie into <hi>London,</hi> or our Coronation? And when moſt of the Monarches, and great Princes in Chriſtendome ſent their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to congratulate my comming hither, and ſome of them came in perſon, was I not bound, both for my owne honour, and the honour of the Kingdome, to giue them good entertainement? But in caſe it might be obiected by ſome, that it is onely vpon occaſions of warre, that Kings obtaine great Supplies from their Subiects: notwithſtanding my interne Peace, I am yet in a kinde of warre, which if it bee without, the more is your ſafetie: For (as the Treaſurer tolde you at large) I am now forced both in reſpects of State, and my promiſe, and for the generall cauſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to ſend a Supply of forces to <hi>Cleues,</hi> and how long that occaſion may laſt, or what greater ſupply the neceſſitie of that Errand may draw mee vnto, no man can yet tell. Beſides that, although I haue put downe that forme of warlike keeping of <hi>Barwicke;</hi> yet are all thoſe commaunders my penſioners that were the late Queenes ſouldiers. And I hope I ſuſtaine a prettie Seminarie of Souldiers in my Forts within this Kingdome, beſides
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:23110:293"/>the two cautionary Townes in the Low-countreys, <hi>Fluſhing</hi> and <hi>Brill.</hi> And as for <hi>Ireland,</hi> yee all know how vncertaine my charges are euer there, that people being ſo eaſily ſtirred, partly through their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and want of ciuilitie, and partly through their corruption in Religion to breake foorth in rebellions. Yee know, how vnlooked for a Rebellion brake foorth there the laſt yeere, which could not but put mee to extraordinary charges. Beſides I doe maintaine there continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally an Armie, which is a goodly Seminarie of expert and old Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And I dare neuer ſuffer the ſame to be diminiſhed, till this Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion take effect, which (no doubt) is the greateſt moate that euer came in the Rebels eyes: and it is to be looked for, that if euer they will bee able to make any ſtirre, they will preſſe at it by all meanes, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting and diſcouraging this Plantation. Now it is trew, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all theſe honourable and neceſſary occaſions of my charge, I haue ſpent much in liberalitie: but yet I hope you will conſider, that what I haue giuen, hath bene giuen amongſt you; and ſo what comes in from you, goes out againe amongſt you. But it may be thought that I haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen much amongſt Scottiſhmen. Indeed if I had not beene liberall in rewarding ſome of my old ſeruants of that Nation, ye could neuer haue had reaſon to expect my thankefulneſſe towards any of you that are more lately become my Subiects, if I had beene ingrate to the old: And yet yee will find, that I haue dealt twice as much amongſt Engliſh men as I haue done to Scottiſhmen. And therefore he that in your Houſe was not aſhamed to affirme, that the ſiluer and gold did ſo abound in <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> was very farre miſtaken; but I wiſh him no worſe puniſhment, then that hee ſhould onely liue vpon ſuch profit of the money there. But I hope you will neuer miſlike me for my liberalitie, ſince I can looke very few of you this day in the face, that haue not made ſuits to mee, at leaſt for ſome thing, either of honour or profit. It is trew, a Kings liberalitie muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be dried vp altogether: for then he can neuer maintaine nor oblige his ſeruants and well deſeruing Subiects: But that vaſtneſſe of my expence is paſt, which I vſed the firſt two or three yeeres after my comming hither: And, as I oft vſed to ſay, that Chriſtmas and open tide is ended: For at my firſt comming here, partly ignorance of this State (which no man can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire but by time and experience) and partly the forme of my comming being ſo honourable and miraculous, enforced me to extend my liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſo much the more at the beginning. Ye ſaw I made Knights then by hundreths, and Barons in great numbers: but I hope you find I doe not ſo now, nor minde not to doe ſo hereafter. For to conclude this point a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent expences, I hold that a Kings expence muſt alwayes bee honourable, though not waſtefull, and the charges of your King in maintaining thoſe ancient honourable formes of liuing that the former Kings of <hi>England</hi> my Predeceſſours haue done, and his liuing to bee ruled according to the proportion of his greatneſſe, is aſwell for the honour of your Kingdome,
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:23110:293"/>as of your King. Now this cannot be ſupplied out of the ayre or liquid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, but muſt come from the people. And for remouing of that diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which men may haue, that I minde not to liue in any waſtefull ſort hereafter, will you but looke vpon my ſelfe and my poſteritie; and if there were no more but that, it will teach you that if I were but a naturall man, I muſt needs bee carefull of my expences: For as for my owne perſon, I hope none that knowes me well, can thinke me but as little inclined to any prodigall humours of vnneceſſary things, as any other reaſonable man of a farre meaner eſtate. Therefore ſince (as I haue ſaid) I cannot be helped but from the people; I aſſure my ſelfe that you will well allow mee ſuch meaſure of Supplie, as the people may beare, and ſupport him with more Honourable meanes then others haue had, that (as I may ſay without vaunting) hath brought you more Honour then euer you had: For I hope there are no good Subiects either within, or out of the Parliament Houſe, that would not be content for ſetting ſtreight once and ſetling the Honourable State of their King, to ſpare ſo much euery one of them out of their purſes, which peraduenture they would in one night throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at Dice or Cards, or beſtow vpon a horſe for their fancies, that might breake his necke or his legge the next morning: Nay I am ſure euery good Subiect would rather chuſe to liue more ſparingly vpon his owne, then that his Kings State ſhould be in want.</p>
            <p>For concluſion then of this purpoſe, I wiſh you now to put a ſpeedie end to your buſineſſe. Freeneſſe in giuing graceth the gift, <hi>Bis dat, qui citò dat;</hi> The longer I want helpe, the greater will my debt ſtill riſe: and ſo muſt I looke for the greater helpes. And now I would pray you to turne your eyes with mee from home, and looke vpon forreine States. Conſider that the eyes of all forreine States are vpon this affaire, and in expectation what the ſucceſſe thereof will be; And what can they thinke, if ye depart without relieuing mee in that proportion that may make me able to maintaine my State, but that either ye are vnwilling to helpe mee, thinking me vnworthy thereof, or at leaſt that my State is ſo deſperate, as it cannot be repaired, and ſo that the Parliament parts in diſgrace with the King, and the King in diſtaſte with the Parliament, which cannot but weaken my reputation both at home and abroad? For of this you may be aſſured, that forreine Princes care the more one for an other, if they may haue reaſon to expect that they may bee able to doe them good or harme in Retribution. And ye know, that if a King fall to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with his neighbours, that cannot but bring an oppreſſion and warre by them vpon him, and then will it be too late to ſupport the King, when the cure is almoſt deſperate. Things foreſeene and preuented, are euer ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlieſt remedied: And therefore I would aduiſe you now ſo to ſettle your buſineſſe, as ye may not take in hand ſo many things at once, as may both croſſe my errand, and euery one of them croſſe another. Yee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the French Prouerbe, <hi>Qui trop embraſſe, rien eſtreint;</hi> We are not in this
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:23110:294"/>Parliament to make our Teſtament, as if wee ſhould neuer meete againe, and that all things that were to be done in any Parliament, were to be done at this time: and yet for filling vp of your vacant houres, I will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to your conſideration ſuch nature of things, as are to bee ſpecially thought vpon in theſe times. Firſt I will beginne at GOD: for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with him makes all other actions to bee bleſſed: And this I meane by the cauſe of Religion. Next I will ſpeake of ſome things that concerne the Common-wealth. And thirdly, matters of Pleaſure and ornament to the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>As for Religion, we haue all great cauſe to take heed vnto it; Papiſts are waxed as proud at this time as euer they were, which makes many to think they haue ſome new plotin hand. And although the pooreſt ſort of them bee (God be thanked) much decreaſed, yet doeth the greater ſort of them dayly increaſe, eſpecially among the foeminine Sexe; nay they are waxed ſo proud, that ſome ſay, no man dare preſent them, nor Iudges meddle with them, they are ſo backed and vpholden by diuers great Courtiers. It is a ſurer and better way to remooue the materials of fire before they bee kindled, then to quench the fire when once it is kindled.</p>
            <q>Nam leuius laedit quicquid praeuidimus antè.</q>
            <p>I doe not meane by this to mooue you to make ſtronger Lawes then are already made, but ſee thoſe Lawes may bee well executed that are in force; otherwiſe they cannot but fall into contempt and become ruſtie. I neuer found, that blood and too much ſeueritie did good in matters of Religion: for, beſides that it is a ſure rule in Diuinitie, that God neuer loues to plant his Church by violence and bloodſhed, naturall reaſon may euen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs, and dayly experience prooues it trew, That when men are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely perſecuted for Religion, the gallantneſſe of many mens ſpirits, and the wilfulnes of their humors, rather then the iuſtneſſe of the cauſe, makes them to take a pride boldy to endure any torments, or death it ſelfe, to gaine thereby the reputatiom of Martyrdome, though but in a falſe ſhadow.</p>
            <p>Some doubts haue beene conceiued anent the vſing of the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, and that part of the Acte which ordaines the taking thereof, is thought ſo obſcure, that no man can tell who ought to bee preſſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. For I my ſelfe, when vpon a time I called the Iudges before mee at their going to their Circuits, I mooued this queſtion vnto them; wherein, as I thought they could not reſolutely anſwere me: And therefore if there bee any ſcruple touching the miniſtring of it, I would wiſh it now to bee cleared. And ſince I haue with my owne pen brought the Popes quarell vpon mee, and proclaimed publique defiance to <hi>Babylon</hi> in maintaining it; ſhould it now ſleepe, and ſhould I ſeeme (as it were) to ſteale from it againe?</p>
            <p>As for Recuſants, let them bee all duely preſented without exception: for in times paſt there hath beene too great a conniuence, and forbearing
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:23110:294"/>of them, eſpecially of great mens wiues, and their kinne and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. None ought to be ſpared from being brought vnder the danger of Law, and then it is my part to vſe mercie, as I thinke conuenient. To winke at faults, and not to ſuffer them to bee diſcouered, is no Honour, nor Mercy in a King, neither is he euer thanked for it; It onely argues his dulneſſe: But to forgiue faults after they are confeſſed, or tried, is Mercie. And now I muſt turne me in this caſe to you, my Lords the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and euen exhort you earneſtly, to be more carefull, then you haue bene, that your Officers may more duely preſent Recuſants, then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore they haue done, without exception of perſons; That althought it muſt be the worke of GOD that muſt make their mindes to bee altered, yet at leaſt by this courſe they may be ſtayed from increaſing, or inſulting vpon vs.</p>
            <p>And that yee all may know the trewth of my heart in this caſe, I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide all my Subiects that are Papiſts, into two rankes: either olde Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that were ſo brought vp in times of Poperie, like old Queene <hi>Mary</hi> Prieſts, and thoſe, that though they bee younger in yeeres, yet haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer drunke in other milke, but beene ſtill nuſled in that blindneſſe: Or elſe ſuch as doe become Apoſtats; hauing once beene of our Profeſſion, and haue forſaken the trewth, either vpon diſcontent, or practiſe, or elſe vpon a light vaine humour of Noueltie, making no more ſcruple to ſeeke out new formes of Religion, then if it were but a new forme of Garment, or a new cut or courtſey after the French faſhion.</p>
            <p>For the former ſort, I pitie them; but if they bee good and quiet Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, I hate not their perſons; and if I were a priuate man, I could well keepe a ciuill friendſhip and conuerſation with ſome of them: But as for thoſe Apoſtates, who, I know, muſt be greateſt haters of their owne Sect, I confeſſe I can neuer ſhew any fauourable countenance toward them, and they may all of them be ſure without exception, that they ſhall neuer finde any more fauour of mee, further then I muſt needs in Iuſtice afford them. And theſe would I haue the Law to ſtrike ſeuerelieſt vpon, and you care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt to diſcouer. Yee know there hath beene great ſtirre kept for beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Concealements theſe yeeres paſt; and I pray you, let mee begge this concealement both of the Biſhops, and Iudges, That Papiſts be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger concealed.</p>
            <p>Next, as concerning the Common wealth, I doe ſpecially recommend vnto you the framing of ſome new Statute for preſeruation of woods. In the end of the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, ye had a Bill amongſt you of that ſubiect; but becauſe you found ſome faults therein, you caſt out the whole Bil: But I could haue rather wiſhed that yee had either mended it, or made a new one; For to caſt out the whole Bill becauſe of ſome faults, was euen as if a man, that had a new garment brought him, would chuſe rather to go na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, then haue his garment made fit for him: But on my coſcience, I cannot
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:23110:295"/>imagine why you ſhould ſo lightly haue eſteemed a thing, ſo neceſſary for the Common wealth, if it were not out of a litle frowardneſſe amongſt you at that time, that what I then recommended earneſtly vnto you, it was the worſe liked of. The maintenance of woods is a thing ſo neceſſary for this Kingdome, as it cannot ſtand, nor be a Kingdome without it: For it concernes you both in your <hi>Eſſe, Bene eſſe,</hi> and in pleaſures. Your <hi>Eſſe:</hi> for without it you want the vſe of one of the moſt neceſſarie Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (which is Fire and fewell to dreſſe your meate with; for neither can the people liue in theſe colde Countries, if they want fire altogether, nor yet can you dreſſe your meate without it; and I thinke you will ill liue like the Cannibals vpon raw fleſh: for the education of this people is farre from that. As to your <hi>bene eſſe;</hi> The decay of woods will neceſſarily bring the decay of Shipping, which both is the ſecurity of this Kingdome, ſince God hath by nature made the Sea to bee the wall of this Iland; and the rather now, ſince God hath vnited it all in my Perſon and Crowne; As alſo by the decay of Shipping will you looſe both all your forraine commodities that are fit for this countrey, and the venting of our owne, which is the loſſe of Trade, that is a maine pillar of this kingdome. And as for Pleaſure, yee know my delight in Hunting and Hawking, and many of your ſelues are of the ſame minde; and all this muſt needes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, by the decay of Woods: Ye haue reaſon therefore to prouide a good Law vpon this Subiect.</p>
            <p>Now as to the laſt point concerning matters of Pleaſure, it conſiſts in the preſeruing of Game, which is now almoſt vtterly deſtroyed through all the Kingdome. And if you offer not now a better Law for this, then was made in the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, I will neuer thanke you for it: For as for your Law anent Partridge and Pheſant, you haue giuen leaue to euery man how poore a Farmour that euer hee bee, to take and deſtroy them in his owne ground how he liſt. But I pray you, how can the Game bee maintained, if Gentlemen that haue great Lordſhips ſhall breed and preſerue them there, and ſo ſoone as euer they ſhall but flie ouer the hedge and light in a poore fellowes Cloſe, they ſhall all be deſtroyed? Surely I know no remedie for preſeruing the Game that breedes in my grounds, except I caſt a roofe ouer all the ground, or elſe put veruels to the Partrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges feet with my Armes vpon them, as my Hawkes haue: otherwiſe I know not how they ſhall bee knowen to be the Kings Partridges, when they light in a Farmours Cloſe.</p>
            <p>And by your Lawe againſt ſtealing of Deere or Conies, after a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and prohibition of ſtealing them, you conclude in the end with a reſtriction, that all this puniſhment ſhall bee vnderſtood to bee vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them that ſteale the Game in the night: Which hath much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged all the looſer ſort of people, that it is no fault to ſteale Deere, ſo they doe it not like theeues in the night. As was that Law of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi>
               <pb n="547" facs="tcp:23110:295"/>againſt theft, that did not forbid theft, but onely taught them to doe it cunningly, and without diſcouerie: Whereupon a fooliſh boy ſuffered a Foxe to gnaw his heart through his breaſt. And this doctrine is like that Leſſon of the Cannon Law, <hi>Si non caſtè, tamen cautè.</hi> I knowe you thinke that I ſpeake partially in this caſe like a Hunter; But there is neuer a one of you that heares mee, that cares the leaſt for the ſport, for preſeruation of the Game, but he would be as glad to haue a paſtie of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon if you might get it, as the beſt Hunter would: And if the Game be not preſerued, you can eate no Veniſon. As for Partridge and Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, I doe not denie that Gentlemen ſhould haue their ſport, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vpon their owne ground. But firſt I doe not thinke ſuch Game and pleaſures ſhould be free to baſe people. And next I would euen wiſh that Gentlemen ſhould vſe it in a Gentlemanlike faſhion, and not with Nets, or Gunnes, or ſuch other vngentlemanlike faſhions that ſerue but for vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſtruction of all Game, nor yet to kill them at vnſeaſonable times, as to kill the Pheſant and Partridges when they are no bigger then Mice, when as for euery one their Hawkes kill, ten will be deſtroyed with their Dogs and Horſe feet; beſides the great and intolerable harme they doe to Corne in that ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>And now in the end of all this faſchious Speach, I muſt conclude like a Grey Frier, in ſpeaking for my ſelfe at laſt. At the beginning of this Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Parliament, when the Treaſourer opened my neceſſities vnto you, then my Purſe onely laboured; But now that word is ſpread both at home and abroad of the demaunds I haue made vnto you; my Reputation la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth aſwellas my Purſe: For if you part without the repairing of my State in ſome reaſonable ſort, what can the world thinke, but that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill will my Subiects beare vnto mee, hath bred a refuſe? And yee can neuer part ſo, without apprehending that I am diſtaſted with your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, and yet to be in feare of my diſpleaſure. But I aſſure and promiſe my ſelfe farre otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus haue I now performed my promiſe, in preſenting vnto you the Chriſtall of your Kings heart.</p>
            <p>Yee know that principally by three wayes yee may wrong a Mirrour.</p>
            <p>Frſt, I pray you, looke not vpon my Mirrour with a falſe light: which yee doe, if ye miſtake, or miſ-vnderſtand my Speach, and ſo alter the ſence thereof.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, I pray you beware to ſoile it with a foule breath, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane hands: I meane, that yee peruert not my words by any corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:23110:296"/>turning them to an ill meaning, like one, who when hee heares the tolling of a Bell, fancies to himſelfe, that it ſpeakes thoſe words which are moſt in his minde.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, (which is worſt of all) beware to let it fall or breake; (for glaſſe is brittle) which ye doe, if ye lightly eſteeme it, and by contemning it, conforme not your ſelues to my perſwaſions.</p>
            <p>To conclude then: As all theſe three dayes of <hi>Iubile</hi> haue fallen in the midſt of this ſeaſon of penitence, wherein you haue preſented your thanks to me, and I the like againe to you: So doe I wiſh and hope, that the end of this Parliament will bee ſuch, as wee may all haue cauſe (both I your Head, and yee the Body) to ioyne in Euchariſticke Thanks and Praiſes vnto God, for our ſo good and happie an end.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>IVE THY IVDGEMENTS TO THE KING, O GOD, AND THY RIGHTEOVSNES TO THE KINGS SONNE.</p>
            <p>Theſe be the firſt words of one of the Pſalmes of the Kingly Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> whereof the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe runnes vpon him, and his ſonne <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and the myſticall ſenſe vpon GOD and CHRIST his eternall Sonne: but they are both ſo wouen together, as ſome parts are, and can onely bee properly applied vnto GOD and CHRIST, and other parts vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> as this Verſe, <hi>Giue thy Iudgements to the King, O God, and thy Righteouſneſse to the Kings Sonne,</hi> cannot be properly ſpoken of any, but of <hi>Dauid</hi> and his ſonne; becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Giue thy Iudgements, &amp;c.</hi> Now God cannot giue to himſelfe. In another part of the ſame Pſalme, where it is ſaid, that <hi>Righteouſnes ſhall flouriſh, and abundance of Peace, as long as the Moone endureth,</hi> it ſignifieth eternitie, and cannot be properly applied but to GOD and CHRIST: But both ſenſes, aſwell literall as myſticall, ſerue to Kings for imitation, and eſpecially to Chriſtian Kings: for Kings ſit in the Throne of GOD, and they themſelues are called Gods.</p>
            <p>And therefore all good Kings in their gouernment, muſt imitate GOD
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:23110:297"/>and his Chriſt, in being iuſt and righteous; <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> in being godly and wiſe: To be wiſe, is vnderſtood, able to diſcerne, able to iudge others: To be godly is, that the fountaine be pure whence the ſtreames proceed: for what auailes it though all his workes be godly, if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not from godlineſſe: To bee righteous, is to a mans ſelfe: To bee iuſt, is towards others. But Iuſtice in a King auailes not, vnleſſe it be with a cleane heart: for except he bee Righteous aſwell as Iuſt, he is no good King; and whatſoeuer iuſtice he doeth; except he doeth it for Iuſtice ſake, and out of the pureneſſe of his owne heart, neither from priuate ends, vaine-glory, or any other by-reſpects of his owne, all ſuch Iuſtice is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, and no trew Iuſtice. From this imitation of GOD and CHRIST, in whoſe Throne wee ſit, the gouernment of all Common-wealths, and eſpecially Monarchies, hath bene from the beginning ſetled and eſtabliſhed. Kings are properly Iudges, and Iudgement properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them from GOD: for Kings ſit in the Throne of GOD, and thence all Iudgement is deriued.</p>
            <p>In all well ſetled Monarchies, where Law is eſtabliſhed formerly and orderly, there Iudgement is deferred from the King to his ſubordinate Magiſtrates; not that the King takes it from himſelfe, but giues it vnto them: So it comes not to them <hi>Priuatiuè,</hi> but <hi>cumulatiuè,</hi> as the Shoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpeake. The ground is ancient, euer ſithence that Counſell which <hi>Iethro</hi> gaue to <hi>Moſes:</hi> for after that <hi>Moſes</hi> had gouerned a long time, in his owne perſon, the burthen grew ſo great, hauing none to helpe him, as his father in law comming to viſite him, found him ſo cumbred with miniſtring of Iuſtice, that neither the people were ſatisfied, nor he well able to performe it; Therefore by his aduice, Iudges were deputed for eaſier queſtions, and the greater and more profound were left to <hi>Moſes:</hi> And according to this eſtabliſhment; all Kings that haue had a formall gouernement, eſpecially Chriſtian Kings in all aages haue gouerned their people, though after a diuers maner.</p>
            <p>This Deputation is after one manner in <hi>France,</hi> after another here, and euen my owne Kingdomes differ in this point of gouernment: for <hi>Scotland</hi> differs both from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> herein; but all agree in this, (I ſpeake of ſuch Kingdomes or States where the formalitie of Law hath place) that the King that ſits in Gods Throne, onely deputes ſubal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne Iudges, and he deputes not one but a number (for no one ſubalterne Iudges mouth makes Law) and their office is to interprete Law, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Iuſtice. But as to the number of them, the forme of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the maner of interpretation, the diſtinction of Benches, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of Courts; theſe varie according to the varietie of gouernment, and inſtitution of diuers Kings: So this ground I lay, that the ſeate of Iudgement is properly Gods, and Kings are Gods Vicegerents; and by Kings Iudges are deputed vnder them, to beare the burden of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the firſt example of <hi>Moſes</hi> by the aduice of <hi>Iethro,</hi> and
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:23110:297"/>ſithence practiſed by <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> the wiſeſt Kings that euer were; which is in this Pſalme ſo interlaced, that as the firſt verſe cannot be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied properly but to <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> in the words, <hi>Giue thy Iudgements to the King,</hi> &amp;c. So the other place in the ſame Pſalme, <hi>Righteouſneſse ſhall flouriſh, and abundance of peace ſhall remaine as long as the Moone endureth,</hi> properly ſignifieth the eternitie of CHRIST. This I ſpeake, to ſhew what a neere coniunction there is betweene God and the King vpward, and the King and his Iudges downewards: for the ſame coniunction that is betweene God and the King vpward; the ſame coniunction is betweene the King and his Iudges downewards.</p>
            <p>As Kings borrow their power from God, ſo Iudges from Kings: And as Kings are to accompt to God, ſo Iudges vnto God and Kings; and both Kings and Iudges by imitation, haue two qualities from God and his Chriſt, and two qualities from <hi>Dauid</hi> and his <hi>Salomon:</hi> Iudgement and Righteouſneſſe, from God and Chriſt: Godlineſſe and Wiſedome from <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon.</hi> And as no King can diſcharge his accompt to God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he make conſcience not to alter, but to declare and eſtabliſh the will of God: So Iudges cannot diſcharge their accompts to Kings, vnleſſe they take the like care, not to take vpon them to make Law, but ioyned together after a deliberate conſultation, to declare what the Law is; For as Kings are ſubiect vnto Gods Law, ſo they to mans Law. It is the Kings Office to protect and ſettle the trew interpretation of the Law of God within his Dominions: And it is the Iudges Office to interprete the Law of the King, whereto themſelues are alſo ſubiect.</p>
            <p>Hauing now perfourmed this ancient Prouerbe, <hi>A Ioue principium;</hi> which though it was ſpoken by a Pagan, yet it is good and holy: I am now to come to my particular Errand, for which I am heere this day; wherein I muſt handle two parts: Firſt, the reaſon why I haue not theſe fourteene yeeres, ſithence my Coronation vntill now, ſatisfied a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my louing ſubiects, who I know haue had a great expectation, and as it were a longing, like them that are with child, to heare mee ſpeake in this place, where my Predeceſſors haue often ſitten, and eſpecially King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeuenth, from whom, as diuers wayes before, I am lineally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, and that doubly to this Crowne; and as I am neereſt deſcended of him, ſo doe I deſire to follow him in his beſt actions.</p>
            <p>The next part is the reaſon, Why I am now come: The cauſe that made mee abſtaine, was this: When I came into <hi>England,</hi> although I was an old King, paſt middle aage, and practiſed in gouernment euer ſithence I was twelue yeeres olde; yet being heere a ſtranger in gouernement, though not in blood, becauſe my breeding was in another Kingdome; I reſolued therefore with <hi>Pythagoras</hi> to keepe ſilence ſeuen yeeres, and learne my ſelfe the Lawes of this Kingdome, before I would take vpon mee to teach them vnto others: When this Apprentiſhip was ended, then another impediment came, which was in the choice of that cauſe, that ſhould firſt
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:23110:298"/>bring me hither. I expected ſome great cauſe to make my firſt entry vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For I thought that hauing abſtained ſo long, it ſhould be a worthy matter that ſhould bring mee hither. Now euery cauſe muſt be great or ſmall: In ſmall cauſes I thought it diſgracefull to come, hauing beene ſo long abſent: In great cauſes, they muſt be either betwixt the King and ſome of his Subiects, or betwixt Subiect and Subiect.</p>
            <p>In a cauſe where my ſelfe was concerned, I was loath to come, becauſe men ſhould not thinke I did come for my owne priuate, either Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue or profit; or for any other by-reſpect: And in that caſe I will alwayes abide the triall of men and Angels, neuer to haue had any particular end, in that which is the Maine of all things, <hi>Iuſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a great cauſe alſo betweene partie and partie, great in reſpect either of the queſtion, or value of the thing, my comming might ſeeme, as it were obliquely, to be in fauour of one partie, and for that cauſe this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour, or that Courtier might be thought to mooue me to come hither; And a meane cauſe was not worthy of mee, eſpecially for my firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance: So lacke of choice in both reſpects kept mee off till now: And now hauing paſſed a double apprentiſhip of twice ſeuen yeeres, I am come hither to ſpeake vnto you. And next as to the reaſons of my comming at this time, they are theſe.</p>
            <p>I haue obſerued in the time of my whole Reigne here, and my double Apprentiſhip, diuers things fallen out in the Iudicatures here at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> Hall, that I thought required and vrged a reformation at my hands; whereupon I reſolued with my ſelfe, that I could not more fitly begin a reformation, then here to make an open declaration of my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. I remember Chriſts ſaying, <hi>My ſheepe heare my voyce,</hi> and ſo I aſſure my ſelfe, my people will moſt willingly heare the voyce of me, their owne Shepheard and King; whereupon I tooke this occaſion in mine owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon here in this Seate of Iudgement, not iudicially, but declaratorily and openly to giue thoſe directions, which, at other times, by piece-meale, I haue deliuered to ſome of you in diuers leſſe publike places; but now will put it vp in all your audience, where I hope it ſhall bee trewly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and cannot be miſtaken, as it might haue bene when it was ſpoken more priuately: I will for order ſake take mee to the methode of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Three, the number of perfection, and vpon that number diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute all I haue to declare to you.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, I am to giue a charge to my ſelfe: for a King, or Iudge vnder a King, that firſt giues not a good charge to himſelfe, will neuer be able to giue a good charge to his inferiours; for as I haue ſaid, Good riuers cannot flow but from good ſprings; if the fountaine be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, ſo muſt the riuers be.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to the Iudges: And thirdly, to the Auditory, and the reſt of the inferiour miniſters of Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="553" facs="tcp:23110:298"/>Firſt, I proteſt to you all, in all your audience, heere ſitting in the ſeate of Iuſtice, belonging vnto GOD, and now by right fallen vnto mee, that I haue reſolued, as Confirmation in Maioritie followeth Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in minoritie; ſo now after many yeeres, to renew my promiſe and Oath made at my Coronation concerning Iuſtice, and the promiſe therein for maintenance of the Law of the Land. And I proteſt in GODS preſence, my care hath euer beene to keepe my conſcience cleare in all the points of my Oath, taken at my Coronation, ſo farre as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailtie may permit mee, or my knowledge enforme mee, I ſpeake in point of Iuſtice and Law; For Religion, I hope I am reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably well knowen already: I meane therefore of Lawe and Iuſtice; and for Law, I meane the Common Law of the Land, according to which the King gouernes, and by which the people are gouerned. For the Common Law, you can all beare mee witneſſe, I neuer preſſed altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in Parliament; but on the contrary, when I endeauoured moſt an Vnion reall, as was already in my perſon, my deſire was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Lawes of <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and not the Law of <hi>England</hi> to the Law of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and ſo the prophecie to be trew of my wiſe Grandfather <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeuenth, who foretold that the leſſer Kingdome by marriage, would follow the greater, and not the greater the leſſer; And therefore married his eldeſt daughter <hi>Margaret</hi> to <hi>Iames</hi> the fourth, my great Grandfather.</p>
            <p>It was a fooliſh Querke of ſome Iudges, who held that the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> could not vnite <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> by the name of <hi>Great Britaine,</hi> but that it would make an alteration of the Lawes, though I am ſince come to that knowledge, that an Acte of Parliament can doe greater wonders: And that old wiſe man the Treaſourer <hi>Burghley</hi> was wont to ſay, Hee knew not what an Acte of Parliament could not doe in <hi>England;</hi> For my intention was alwayes to effect vnion by vniting <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> and not <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Scotland:</hi> For I euer meant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euer reſolued, that this Law ſhould continue in this Kingdome, and two things mooued mee thereunto; One is, that in matter of Policie and State, you ſhall neuer ſee any thing anciently and maturely eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, but by Innouation or alteration it is worſe then it was, I meane not by purging of it from corruptions, and reſtoring it to the ancient integritie; Another reaſon was, I was ſworne to maintaine the Law of the Land, and therefore I had beene periured if I had altered it; And this I ſpeake to root out the conceit and miſapprehenſion, if it be in any heart, that I would change, damnifie, vilifie or ſuppreſſe the Law of this Land: GOD is my Iudge I neuer meant it; And this confirmation I make before you all.</p>
            <p>To this I ioyne the point of Iuſtice, which I call <hi>Vnicuique ſuum tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buere.</hi> All my Councell, and Iudges dead and aliue, can, and could beare mee witneſſe, how vnpartiall I haue beene in declaring of Law.
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:23110:299"/>And where it hath concerned mee in my owne inheritance, I haue as willingly ſubmitted my intereſt to the Lawe, as any my Subiects could doe; and it becomes mee ſo to doe, to giue example to others: much leſſe then will I be partiall to others, where I am not to my ſelfe. And ſo reſolue your ſelues, Iuſtice with mee may bee moderated in point of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie: for no Iuſtice can be without mercie. But in matters of Iuſtice to giue euery man his owne, to be blinde without eyes of partialitie; This is my full reſolution.</p>
            <p>I vſed to ſay when I was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> if any man mooued mee to delay Iuſtice, that it was againſt the Office of a King ſo to doe; But when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny made ſuite to haſten Iuſtice, I told them I had rather grant fourtie of theſe ſuits, then one of the other: This was alwayes my cuſtome and ſhall be euer, with Gods leaue.</p>
            <p>Now what I haue ſpoken of Law and Iuſtice, I meane by the Lawe kept in her owne bounds: For I vnderſtand the inheritance of the King, and Subiects in this land, muſt bee determined by the Common Law,  and that is, by the Law ſet downe in our forefathers time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by learned men diuers times after in the declaratory Comments, called <hi>Responſa Prudentum;</hi> Or elſe by Statute Law ſet downe by Acte of Parliament, as occaſion ſerues: By this I doe not ſeclude all other Lawes of <hi>England;</hi> but this is the Law of inheritance in this Kingdome.</p>
            <p>There is another Law, of all Lawes free and ſupreame, which is GODS LAVV: And by this all Common and municipall Lawes muſt be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: And except they haue dependance vpon this Law, they are vniuſt and vnlawfull.</p>
            <p>When I ſpeake of that Law, I onely giue this touch, That that Law in this Kingdome hath beene too much neglected, and Churchmen too much had in contempt; I muſt ſpeake trewth, Great men, Lords, Iudges, and people of all degrees from the higheſt to the loweſt, haue too much contemned them: And God will not bleſſe vs in our owne Lawes, if wee doe not reuerence and obey GODS LAVV; which cannot bee, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the interpreters of it be reſpected and reuerenced.</p>
            <p>And it is a ſigne of the latter dayes drawing on; euen the contempt of the Church, and of the Gouernours and Teachers thereof now in the Church of ENGLAND, which I ſay in my Conſcience, of any Church that euer I read or knew of, preſent or paſt, is moſt pure, and neereſt the Primitiue and Apoſtolicall Church in Doctrine and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and is ſurelieſt founded vpon the word of God, of any Church in Chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>Next vnto this Law is the Law of Nations, which God forbid ſhould bee barred, and that for two cauſes: One, becauſe it is a Law to ſatisfie Strangers, which will not ſo well hold themſelues ſatisfied with other municipall Lawes: Another, to ſatisfie our owne Subiects in matters of Piracie, Marriage, Wills, and things of like nature: That Law I
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:23110:299"/>diuide into Ciuil and Canon; And this Law hath bene ſo much encroched vpon, ſithence my comming to the Crowne, and ſo had in contempt, that young men are diſcouraged from ſtudying, and the reſt wearie of their liues that doe profeſſe it, and would be glad to ſeeke any other craft.</p>
            <p>So, ſpeaking of the Common Law, I meane the Common Law kept within her owne limits, and not derogating from theſe other Lawes, which by longer cuſtome haue beene rooted here; firſt, the Law of GOD and his Church; and next, the Law Ciuill and Canon, which in many caſes cannot be wanting.</p>
            <p>To conclude this charge which I giue my ſelfe, I profeſſe to maintaine all the points of mine Oath, eſpecially in Lawes, and of Lawes, eſpecially the Common Law.</p>
            <p>And as to maintaine it, ſo to purge it; for elſe it cannot bee maintained: and eſpecially to purge it from two corruptions, Incertaintie and Nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Incertaintie is found in the Law it ſelfe, wherein I will bee painefull to cleare it to the people; and this is properly to bee done in Parliament by aduice of the Iudges.</p>
            <p>The other corruption is introduced by the Iudges themſelues, by Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities that are vſed, where it may be ſaid, <hi>Ab initio non fuit ſic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing in the world is more likely to be permanent to our eyes then yron or ſteele, yet the ruſt corrupts it, if it bee not kept cleane: which ſheweth, nothing is permanent here in this world, if it be not purged; So I cannot diſcharge my conſcience in maintaining the Lawes, if I keepe them not cleane from corruption.</p>
            <p>And now that I may bee like the Paſtor, that firſt takes the Sacrament himſelfe, and then giues it to the people: So I haue firſt taken my owne charge vpon me, before I giue you your Charge, leſt it might be ſaid,
<q>
                  <hi>Turpe est doctori, cùm culpa redarguit ipſum.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow my Lords the Iudges for your parts, the Charge I haue to giue you, conſiſts likewiſe in three parts.</p>
            <p>Firſt in generall, that you doe Iuſtice vprightly, as you ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to GOD and mee: For as I haue onely GOD to anſwere to, and to expect puniſhment at his hands, if I offend; So you are to anſwere both to GOD and to mee, and expect puniſhment at GODS hands and mine, if you be found in fault.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to doe Iuſtice indifferently betweene Subiect and Subiect, betweene King and Subiect, without delay, partialitie, feare or bribery, with ſtout and vpright hearts, with cleane and vncorrupt hands.</p>
            <p>When I bid you doe Iuſtice boldly, yet I bid you doe it fearefully; fearefully in this, to vtter your owne conceites, and not the trew mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Law: And remember you are no makers of Law, but Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretours of Law, according to the trew ſence thereof; for your Office is <hi>Ius dicere,</hi> and not <hi>Ius dare:</hi> And that you are ſo farre from making Law, that euen in the higher houſe of Parliament, you haue no voyce in
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:23110:300"/>making of a Law, but only to giue your aduice when you are required.</p>
            <p>And though the Laws be in many places obſcure, and not ſo wel know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the multitude as to you; and that there are many parts that come not into ordinary practiſe, which are knowen to you, becauſe you can finde out the reaſon thereof by bookes and preſidents; yet know this, that your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations muſt be alwayes ſubiect to common ſenſe and reaſon.</p>
            <p>For I will neuer truſt any Interpretation, that agreeth not with my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe and reaſon, and trew Logicke: for <hi>Ratio eſt anima Legis</hi> in all humane Lawes, without exception; it muſt not be Sophiſtrie or ſtraines of wit that muſt interprete, but either cleare Law, or ſolide reaſon.</p>
            <p>But in Countreys where the formalitie of Law hath no place, as in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> which I may trewly report, as hauing my ſelfe beene an eye-witneſſe thereof; all their State is gouerned onely by a written Law; there is no Aduocate or Proctour admitted to plead, onely the parties themſelues plead their owne cauſe, and then a man ſtands vp and reads the Law, and there is an end, for the very Law-booke it ſelfe is their onely Iudge. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py were all Kingdomes if they could be ſo: But heere, curious wits, various conceits, different actions, and varietie of examples breed queſtions in Law: And therefore when you heare the queſtions if they be plaine, there is a plaine way in it ſelfe; if they be ſuch as are not plaine (for mens inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions dayly abound) then are you to interprete according to common ſenſe, and draw a good and certaine <hi>Minor</hi> of naturall reaſon, out of the <hi>Maior</hi> of direct Lawe, and thereupon to make a right and trew <hi>Concluſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For though the Common Law be a myſtery and skill beſt knowen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſelues, yet if your interpretation be ſuch, as other men which haue Logicke and common ſenſe vnderſtand not the reaſon, I will neuer truſt ſuch an Interpretation.</p>
            <p>Remember alſo you are Iudges, and not a Iudge; and diuided into Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which ſheweth that what you doe, that you ſhould doe with aduice and deliberation, not haſtily and raſhly, before you well ſtudy the caſe, and conferre together; debating it duely, not giuing ſingle opinions, <hi>per emendicata ſuffragia;</hi> and ſo to giue your Iudgement, as you will anſwer to God and me.</p>
            <p>Now hauing ſpoken of your Office in generall, I am next to come to the limits wherein you are to bound yourſelues, which likewiſe are three. Firſt, Incroach not vpon the Prerogatiue of the Crowne: If there fall out a queſtion that concernes my Prerogatiue or myſtery of State, deale not with it, till you conſult with the King or his Councell, or both: for they are tranſcendent matters, and muſt not be ſliberely ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with ouer-raſh wilfulneſſe; for ſo may you wound the King through the ſides of a priuate perſon: and this I commend vnto your ſpeciall care, as ſome of you of late haue done very well, to blunt the ſharpe edge and vaine popular humour of ſome Lawyers at the Barre,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:23110:300"/>that thinke they are not eloquent and bold ſpirited enough, except they meddle with the Kings Prerogatiue: But doe not you ſuffer this; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely if this liberty be ſuffered, the Kings Prerogatiue, the Crowne, and I, ſhall bee as much wounded by their pleading, as if you reſolued what they diſputed: That which concernes the myſterie of the Kings power, is not lawfull to be diſputed; for that is to wade into the weakeneſſe of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to take away the myſticall reuerence, that belongs vnto them that ſit in the Throne of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That you keepe yourſelues within your owne Benches, not to inuade other Iuriſdictions, which is vnfit, and an vnlawful thing; In this I muſt inlarge my ſelfe. Beſides the Courts of Common Law, there is the Court of Requeſts; the Admiraltie Court; the Court of the Preſident and Councell of Walles, the Preſident and Councell of the North; High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Courts, euery Biſhop in his owne Court.</p>
            <p>Theſe Courts ought to keepe their owne limits and boundes of their Commiſſion and Inſtructions, according to the ancient Preſidents: And like as I declare that my pleaſure is, that euery of theſe ſhall keepe their owne limits and boundes; So the Courts of Common Lawe are not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach vpon them, no more then it is my pleaſure that they ſhould encroach vpon the Common Law. And this is a thing Regall and proper to a King, to keepe euery Court within his owne bounds.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall there are foure Courts: Two that handle cauſes Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, which are the Common-pleas, and the Exchequer: Two that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine cauſes Criminall, which are the Kings-Bench, and the Starre-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where now I ſit. The Common-Pleas is a part and branch of the Kings-Bench; for it was firſt all one Court; and then the Common-Pleas being extracted, it was called Common-Pleas; becauſe it medled with the Pleas of Priuate perſons, and that which remained, the Kings-Bench. The other of the Courts for ciuill Cauſes, is the Exchequer, which was ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the Kings Reuenew: That is the principall Inſtitution of that Court, and ought to be their chiefe ſtudie; and as other things come order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thither by occaſion of the former, they may be handled, and Iuſtice there adminiſtred.</p>
            <p>Keepe you therefore all in your owne bounds, and for my part, I deſire you to giue me no more right in my priuate Prerogatiue, then you giue to any Subiect; and therein I will be acquieſcent: As for the abſolute Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of the Crowne, that is no Subiect for the tongue of a Lawyer, nor is lawfull to be diſputed.</p>
            <p>It is Athieſme and blaſphemie to diſpute what God can doe: good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians content themſelues with his will reuealed in his word. ſo, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and high contempt in a Subiect, to diſpute what a King can doe, or ſay that a King cannot doe this, or that; but reſt in that which is the Kings reuealed will in his Law.</p>
            <p>The Kings-Bench is the principall Court for criminall cauſes, and in
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:23110:301"/>ſome reſpects it deales with Ciuill cauſes.</p>
            <p>Then is there a Chancerie Court; this is a Court of Equitie, and hath power to deale likewiſe in Ciuill cauſes: It is called the diſpenſer of the Kings Conſcience, following alwayes the intention of Law and Iuſtice; not altering the Law, not making that blacke which other Courts made white, nor <hi>è conuerſo;</hi> But in this it exceeds other Courts, mixing Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie with Iuſtice, where other Courts proceed onely according to the ſtrict rules of Law: And where the rigour of the Law in many caſes will vndoe a Subiect, there the Chancerie tempers the Law with equitie, and ſo mixeth Mercy with Iuſtice, as it preſerues men from deſtruction.</p>
            <p>And thus (as before I told you) is the Kings Throne eſtabliſhed by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>The Chancerie is vndependant of any other Court, and is onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King: There it is written <hi>Teſte meipſo;</hi> from that Court there is no Appeale. And as I am bound in my Conſcience to maintaine eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Courts Iuriſdiction, ſo eſpecially this, and not ſuffer it to ſuſtaine wrong; yet ſo to maintaine it, as to keepe it within the owne limits, and free from corruption. My Chancellour that now is, I found him Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Seale, the ſame place in ſubſtance, although I gaue him the Stile of Chancellour, and God hath kept him in it till now; and I pray God he may hold it long; and ſo I hope he will. He will beare mee witneſſe, I neuer gaue him other warrant, then to goe on in his Court according to Preſidents, warranted by Law in the time of the beſt gouerning Kings, and moſt learned Chancellours: Theſe were the limits I gaue vnto him; beyond the ſame limits he hath promiſed me he will neuer goe.</p>
            <p>And as he hath promiſed me to take no other Iuriſdiction to himſelfe, ſo is it my promiſe euer to maintaine this Iuriſdiction in that Court: Therefore I ſpeake this to vindicate that Court from miſconceipt and contempt.</p>
            <p>It is the duetie of Iudges to puniſh thoſe that ſeeke to depraue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of any the Kings Courts, and not to encourage them any way: And I muſt confeſſe I thought it an odious and inept ſpeach, and it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me very much, that it ſhould be ſaid in <hi>Westminſter</hi> Hall, that a <hi>Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire</hi> lay againſt the Court of the Chancery and Officers there: How can the King grant a <hi>Premunire</hi> againſt himſelfe?</p>
            <p>It was a fooliſh, inept, and preſumptuous attempt, and fitter for the time of ſome vnworthy King: vnderſtand mee aright; I meane not, the Chancerie ſhould exceed his limite; but on the other part; the King onely is to correct it, and none elſe: And therefore I was greatly abuſed in that attempt: For if any was wronged there, the complaint ſhould haue come to mee. None of you but will confeſſe you haue a King of reaſonable vnderſtanding, and willing to reforme; why then ſhould you ſpare to complaine to me, that being the high way, and not goe the other way, and backe-way, in contempt of our Authoritie?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="559" facs="tcp:23110:301"/>And therefore ſitting heere in a ſeat of Iudgement, I declare and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that no man hereafter preſume to ſue a <hi>Premunire</hi> againſt the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery; which I may the more eaſily doe, becauſe no <hi>Premunire</hi> can bee ſued but at my Suit: And I may iuſtly barre my ſelfe at mine owne pleaſure.</p>
            <p>As all inundations come with ouerflowing the bankes, and neuer come without great inconuenience, and are thought prodigious by Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in things to come: So is this ouerflowing the bankes of your Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in it ſelfe inconuenient, and may proue prodigious to the State.</p>
            <p>Remember therefore, that hereafter you keepe within your limits and Iuriſdictions. It is a ſpeciall point of my Office to procure and command, that amongſt Courts there bee a concordance, and muſicall accord; and it is your parts to obey, and ſee this kept: And, as you are to obſerue the ancient Lawes and cuſtomes of <hi>England;</hi> ſo are you to keepe your ſelues within the bound of direct Law, or Preſidents; and of thoſe, not euery ſnatched Preſident, carped now here, now there, as it were running by the way; but ſuch as haue neuer beene controuerted, but by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, approued by common vſage, in times of beſt Kings, and by moſt learned Iudges.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Starre-Chamber</hi> Court hath bene likewiſe ſhaken of late, and the laſt yeere it had receiued a ſore blow, if it had not bene aſſiſted and caried by a few voyces; The very name of <hi>Starre-Chamber,</hi> ſeemeth to procure a reuerence to the Court.</p>
            <p>I will not play the Criticke to deſcant on the name; It hath a name from heauen, a Starre placed in it; and a Starre is a glorious creature, and ſeated in a glorious place, next vnto the Angels. The <hi>Starre-Chamber</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo glorious in ſubſtance: for in the compoſition, it is of foure ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: The firſt two are Priuie Counſellours and Iudges, the one by wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in matters of State; the other, by learning in matters of Law, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and order all things both according to Law and State: The other two ſorts are Peeres of the Realme, and Biſhops: The Peeres are there by reaſon of their greatneſſe, to giue authority to that Court: The Biſhops becauſe of their learning in Diuinitie, and the intereſt they haue in the good gouernment of the Church: And ſo, both the learning of both Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and humane Law, and experience and practiſe in Gouernment, are conioyned together in the proceedings of this Court.</p>
            <p>There is no Kingdome but hath a Court of Equitie, either by it ſelfe, as is heere in <hi>England,</hi> or elſe mixed, and incorporate in their Office that are Iudges in the Law, as it is in <hi>Scotland:</hi> But the order of <hi>England</hi> is much more perfect, where they are diuided. And as in caſe of Equitie, where the Law determines not clearely, there the Chancerie doeth determine, hauing Equitie belonging to it, which doeth belong to no other Court: So the <hi>Starre-Chamber</hi> hath that belonging to it, which belongs to no other Court: For in this Court Attempts are puniſhable, where other Courts puniſh onely facts; And alſo where the Law puniſheth facts
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:23110:302"/>eaſily, as in caſe of Riots or Combates, there the Starre-Chamber puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a higher degree; And alſo all combinations of practiſes and conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies; And if the King be diſhonoured or contemned in his Prerogatiue, it belongeth moſt properly to the Peeres and Iudges of this Court to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it: So then this Court being inſtituted for ſo great cauſes, it is great reaſon it ſhould haue great honour.</p>
            <p>Remember now how I haue taught you brotherly loue one toward another: For you know well, that as you are Iudges, you are all brethren, and your Courts are ſiſters. I pray you therefore, labour to keepe that ſweete harmonie, which is amongſt thoſe ſiſters the <hi>Muſes.</hi> What greater miſerie can there bee to the Law, then contempt of the Law? and what readier way to contempt, then when queſtions come, what ſhall bee determined in this Court, and what in that? Whereupon two euils doe ariſe; The one, that men come not now to Courts of iuſtice, to heare matters of right pleaded, and Decrees giuen accordingly, but onely out of a curioſitie, to heare queſtions of the Iuriſdictions of Courts diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to ſee the euent, what Court is like to preuaile aboue the other; And the other is, that the Pleas are turned from Court to Court in an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe circular motion, as vpon <hi>Ixions</hi> wheele: And this was the reaſon why I found iuſt fault with that multitude of Prohibitions: For when a poore Miniſter had with long labour, and great expence of charge and time, gotten a ſentence for his Tithes, then comes a Prohibition, and turnes him round from Court to Court, and ſo makes his cauſe immortall and endleſſe: for by this vncertaintie of Iuriſdiction amongſt Courts, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ſcourged from Court to Court, and this makes the fruit of Suits like <hi>Tantalus</hi> fruite, ſtill neere the Suiters lips, but can neuer come to taſte it. And this in deed is a great delay of Iuſtice, and makes cauſes end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: Therefore the onely way to auoyd this, is for you to keepe your owne bounds, and nouriſh not the people in contempt of other Courts, but teach them reuerence to Courts in your publique ſpeaches, both in your Benches, and in your Circuits; ſo ſhall you bring them to a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, both of GOD, and of the King.</p>
            <p>Keepe therefore your owne limits towards the King, towards other Courts, and towards other Lawes, bounding your ſelues within your owne Law, and make not new Law. Remember, as I ſaid before, that you are Iudges, to declare, and not to make Law: For when you make a Decree neuer heard of before, you are Law-giuers, and not Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers.</p>
            <p>I haue laboured to gather ſome Articles, like an <hi>Index expurgatorius,</hi> of nouelties new crept into the Law, and I haue it ready to bee conſidered of: Looke to <hi>Plowdens</hi> Caſes, and your old <hi>Responſa prudentum;</hi> if you finde it not there, then <hi>(ab initio non fuit ſic)</hi> I muſt ſay with CHRIST, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the new polygamie, and maintaine the ancient Law pure and vndefiled, as it was before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="561" facs="tcp:23110:302"/>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the Auditory I haue but little to ſay, yet that little will not bee ill beſtowed to be ſaid at this time.</p>
            <p>Since I haue now renewed and confirmed my reſolution to maintaine my Oath, the Law and Iuſtice of the Land; So doe I expect, that you my Subiects doe ſubmit your ſelues as you ought, to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of that Law.</p>
            <p>And as I haue diuided the two former parts of my Charge; So will I diuide this your ſubmiſſion into three parts, for orderly diuiſions and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode, cauſe things better to be remembred.</p>
            <p>Firſt in generall, that you giue due reuerence to the Law; and this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diuides it ſelfe into three.</p>
            <p>Firſt, not to ſue, but vpon iuſt cauſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, beeing ſued, and Iudgement paſſed againſt you, Acquieſce in the Iudgement, and doe not tumultuate againſt it; and take example from mee, whom you haue heard here proteſt, that when euer any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ſhall be giuen againſt me in my priuate right, betweene me and a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, I will as humbly acquieſce as the meaneſt man in the Land. Imitate me in this, for in euery Plea there are two parties, and Iudgement can be but for one, and againſt the other; ſo one muſt alwayes be diſpleaſed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, doe not complaine and importune mee againſt Iudgements; for I hold this Paradoxe to bee a good rule in Gouernment, that it is better for a King to maintaine an vniuſt Decree, then to queſtion euery Decree and Iudgement, after the giuing of a ſentence, for then Suites ſhall neuer haue end: Therefore as you come gaping to the Law for Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſo bee ſatisfied and contented when Iudgement is paſt againſt you, and trouble not mee; but if you finde briberie or corruption, then come boldly: but when I ſay boldly, beware of comming to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, except you bee very ſure to prooue the iuſtice of your cauſe: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe looke for <hi>Lex Talionis</hi> to bee executed vpon you; for your accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of an vpright Iudge, deſerues double puniſhment, in that you ſeeke to lay infamie vpon a worthy perſon of that reuerent calling.</p>
            <p>And be not tild on with your own Lawyers tales, that ſay the cauſe is iuſt for their owne gaine; but beleeue the Iudges that haue no hire but of me.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in your Pleas, preſume not to meddle with things againſt the Kings Prerogatiue, or Honour: Some Gentlemen of late haue beene too bold this wayes; If you vſe it, the Iudges will puniſh you; and if they ſuffer it, I muſt puniſh both them and you. Plead not vpon new Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanicall ſtraines, that make all things popular; but keepe you within the ancient Limits of Pleas.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, make not many changes from Court to Court: for hee that changeth Courts, ſhewes to miſtruſt the iuſtneſſe of the cauſe. Goe to the right place, and the Court that is proper for your cauſe; change not thence, and ſubmit your ſelues to the Iudgement giuen there.</p>
            <p>Thus hauing finiſhed the Charge to my ſelfe, the Iudges and the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:23110:303"/>I am to craue your pardon if I haue forgotten any thing, or beene inforced to breake my Methode; for you muſt remember, I come not hither with a written Sermon: I haue no Bookes to reade it out of, and a long ſpeach, manifold buſineſſe, and a little leaſure may well pleade par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for any fault of memorie; and trewly I know not if I haue forgotten any thing or not.</p>
            <p>And now haue I deliuered, Firſt my excuſe, why I came not till now: Next, the reaſons why I came now: Thirdly, my charge, and that to my ſelfe, to you my Lords the Iudges, and to the Auditory.</p>
            <p>I haue alſo an ordinary charge that I vſe to deliuer to the Iudges before my Councell, when they goe their Circuits; and ſeeing I am come to this place, you ſhall haue that alſo, and ſo I will make the old ſaying trew, <hi>Combe ſeldome, combeſore,</hi> I meane by my long deteining you at this time, which will bee ſo much the more profitable in this Auditorie; becauſe a number of the Auditorie will be informed here, who may relate it to their fellow Iuſtices in the countrey.</p>
            <p>My Lords the Iudges, you know very well, that as you are Iudges with mee when you ſit here; ſo are you Iudges vnder mee, and my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes in the Circuits, where you are Iudges Itinerant to doe Iuſtice to my people.</p>
            <p>It is an ancient and laudable cuſtome in this Kingdome, that the Iudges goe thorow the Kingdome in Circuits, eaſing the people thereby of great charges, who muſt otherwiſe come from all the remote parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to <hi>Weſtminſter Hall,</hi> for the finding out and puniſhing of offences paſt, and preuenting the occaſion or offences that may ariſe.</p>
            <p>I can giue you no other charge in effect, but onely to remember you againe of the ſame in ſubſtance which I deliuered to you this time Twelue-moneth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Remember that when you goe your Circuits, you goe not onely to puniſh-and preuent offences, but you are to take care for the good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in generall of the parts where you trauell, as well as to doe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in particular betwixt party and party, in cauſes criminall and ciuill.</p>
            <p>You haue charges to giue to Iuſtices of peace, that they doe their dueties when you are abſent, aſwell as preſent: Take an accompt of them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their ſeruice to me at your returne.</p>
            <p>As none of you will hold it ſufficient to giue a charge, except in taking the accompt, you finde the fruit of it: So I ſay to you, it will not bee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for you, to heare my charge, if at your returne you bring not an accompt to the harueſt of my ſowing, which cannot be done in generall, but in making to me a particular report what you haue done.</p>
            <p>For, a King hath two Offices.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to direct things to be done:</p>
            <p>Secondly, to take an accompt how they are fulfilled; for what is it the better for me to direct as an Angel, if I take not accompt of your doings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="563" facs="tcp:23110:303"/>I know not whether miſunderſtanding, or ſlackneſſe bred this, that I had no accompt but in generall, of that I gaue you in particular in charge the laſt yeere: Therefore I now charge you againe, that at your next returne, you repaire to my Chancellour, and bring your accompts to him in writing, of thoſe things which in particular I haue giuen you in charge: And then when I haue ſeene your accompts, as occaſion ſhall ſerue, it may bee I will call for ſome of you, to be informed of the ſtate of that part of the countrey where your Circuit lay.</p>
            <p>Of theſe two parts of your ſeruice, I know the ordinary Legall part of <hi>Niſi prius</hi> is the more profitable to you: But the other part of Iuſtice is more neceſſary for my ſeruice. Therefore as CHRIST ſaid to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes, <hi>Hoc agite,</hi> as the moſt principall: yet I will ſay, <hi>Et illud non omittite:</hi> which, that you may the better doe, I haue allowed you a day more in your Circuits, then my Predeceſſours haue done.</p>
            <p>And this you ſhall finde, that euen as a King, (let him be neuer ſo godly, wiſe, righteous, and iuſt) yet if the ſubalterne Magiſtrates doe not their parts vnder him, the Kingdome muſt needes ſuffer: So let the Iudges bee neuer ſo carefull and induſtrious, if the Iuſtices of Peace vnder them, put not to their helping hands, in vaine is all your labour: For they are the Kings eyes and eares in the countrey. It was an ancient cuſtome, that all the Iudges both immediatly before their going to their Circuits, and immediatly vpon their returne, repaired to the Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> both to receiue what directions it ſhould pleaſe the King by his mouth to giue vnto them; as alſo to giue him an accompt of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, who was to acquaint the King therewith: And this good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtome hath likewiſe beene too much ſlacked of late; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt of all, I am to exhort and command you, that you be carefull to giue a good accompt to me and my Chancellour, of the dueties performed by all Iuſtices of Peace in your Circuits: Which gouernment by Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is ſo laudable and ſo highly eſteemed by mee, that I haue made <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to bee gouerned by Iuſtices and Conſtables, as <hi>England</hi> is. And let not Gentlemen be aſhamed of this Place; for it is a place of high Honour, and great reputation, to be made a Miniſter of the Kings Iuſtice, in ſeruice of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Of theſe there are two ſorts, as there is of all Companies, eſpecially where there is a great number; that is, good and bad Iuſtices: For the good, you are to enforme me of them, that I may know them, thanke them, and reward them, as occaſion ſerues: For I hold a good Iuſtice of Peace in his Countrey, to doe mee as good ſeruice, as hee that waites vpon mee in my Priuie Chamber, and as ready will I be to reward him; For I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt him as capable of any Honour, Office, or preferment about my Perſon, or for any place of Councell or State, as well as any Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teour that is neere about mee, or any that haue deſerued well of me in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine employments: Yea, I eſteeme the ſeruice done me by a good Iuſtice
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:23110:304"/>of Peace, three hundred miles, yea ſixe hundred miles out of my ſight, as well as the ſeruice done me in my preſence: For as God hath giuen me large limits, ſo muſt I be carefull that my prouidence may reach to the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt parts of them: And as Law cannot be honoured, except Honour be giuen to Iudges: ſo without due reſpect to Iuſtices of Peace, what regard will be had of the ſeruice?</p>
            <p>Therefore let none be aſhamed of this Office, or be diſcouraged in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Iuſtice of Peace, if he ſerue worthily in it.</p>
            <p>The Chancellour vnder me, makes Iuſtices, and puts them out; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I, nor he can tell what they are: Therefore wee muſt bee informed by you Iudges, who can onely tell, who doe well, and who doe ill; without which, how can the good be cheriſhed and maintained, and the reſt put out? The good Iuſtices are carefull to attend the ſeruice of the King and countrey, for thanks onely of the King, and loue to their countrey, and for no other reſpect.</p>
            <p>The bad are either idle Slowbellies, that abide alwayes at home, giuen to a life of eaſe and delight, liker Ladies then men; and thinke it is enough to contemplate Iuſtice, when as <hi>Virtus in actione conſiſtit:</hi> contemplatiue Iuſtice is no iuſtice, and contemplatiue Iuſtices are fit to be put out.</p>
            <p>Another ſort of Iuſtices are buſie-bodies, and will haue all men dance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their pipe, and follow their greatneſſe, or elſe will not be content; A ſort of men, <hi>Qui ſeprimos omnium eſſe putant, nec ſunt tamen:</hi> theſe proud ſpirits muſt know, that the countrey is ordained to obey and follow GOD and the King, and not them.</p>
            <p>Another ſort are they, that goe ſeldome to the Kings ſeruice, but when it is to helpe ſome of their kindred or alliance; So as when they come, it is to helpe their friends, or hurt their enemies, making Iuſtice to ſerue for a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to Faction, and tumultuating the countrey.</p>
            <p>Another ſort are Gentlemen of great worth in their owne conceit, and cannot be content with the preſent forme of Gouernement, but muſt haue a kind of libertie in the people, and muſt be gracious Lords, and Redeemers of their libertie; and in euery cauſe that concernes Prerogatiue, giue a ſnatch againſt a Monarchie, through their Puritanicall itching after Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laritie: Some of them haue ſhewed themſelues too bold of late in the lower houſe of Parliament: And when all is done, if there were not a King, they would be leſſe cared for then other men.</p>
            <p>And now hauing ſpoken of the qualities of the Iuſtices of Peace; I am next to ſpeake of their number. As I euer held the midway in all things to be the way of Vertue, in eſchewing both extremities: So doe I in this: for vpon the one part, a multitude of Iuſtices of Peace in the countrey more then is neceſſary, breeds but confuſion: for although it be an old Prouerbe, that <hi>Many handes make light worke;</hi> yet too many make ſlight worke; and too great a number of Iuſtices of Peace, will make the buſineſſe of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to be the more neglected, euery one truſting to another, ſo as nothing
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:23110:304"/>ſhall bee well done; beſides the breeding of great corruption: for where there is a great number, it can hardly bee, but ſome will bee corrupted. And vpon the other part, too few Iuſtices of Peace, will not be able to vndergoe the burthen of the ſeruice; And therefore I would neither haue too few, nor too many, but as many in euery countrey, as may, according to the proportion of that countrey, bee neceſſary for the performing of the ſeruice there, and no more.</p>
            <p>As to the Charge you are to giue to the Iuſtices, I can but repeat what formerly I haue told you; yet in ſo good a buſineſſe,
<q>
                  <hi>Lectio lecta placet, decies repetita placebit.</hi>
               </q> And as I began with fulfilling the Prouerbe, <hi>A Ioue principium;</hi> ſo will I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin this Charge you are to giue to the Iuſtices with Church-matters: for GOD will bleſſe euery good buſineſſe the better, that he and his Church haue the precedence. That which I am now to ſpeake, is anent Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants and Papiſts. You neuer returned from any Circuit, but by your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt made vnto me, I both conceiued great comfort and great griefe: Comfort, when I heard a number of Recuſants in ſome Circuits to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed: Griefe to my heart and ſoule, when I heard a number of Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants to be in other Circuits increaſed.</p>
            <p>I proteſt vnto you, nothing in the earth can grieue mee ſo much, as mens falling away from Religion in my dayes; And nothing ſo much ioyes mee, as when that Religion increaſeth vnder mee. GOD is my witneſſe, I ſpeake nothing for vaine-glory; but ſpeake it againe; My heart is grieued when I heare Recuſants increaſe: Therefore I wiſh you Iudges, to take it to heart, as I doe, and preuent it as you can; and make me knowen to my people, as I am.</p>
            <p>There are three ſorts of Recuſants: The firſt are they that for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues will bee no Recuſants, but their wiues and their families are; and they themſelues doe come to Church, but once or twice in a yeere, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Law, or for faſhion ſake; Theſe may be formall to the Law, but more falſe to GOD then the other ſort.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort are they that are Recuſants and haue their conſcience miſſe-led, and therefore refuſe to come to Church, but otherwiſe liue as peaceable Subiects.</p>
            <p>The third ſort are practiſing Recuſants: Theſe force all their ſeruants to bee Recuſants with them; they will ſuffer none of their Tenants, but they muſt bee Recuſants; and their neighbours if they liue by them in peace, muſt be Recuſants alſo.</p>
            <p>Theſe you may finde out as a foxe by the foule ſmell, a great way round about his hole; This is a high pride and preſumption, that they for whoſe ſoules I muſt anſwere to GOD, and who enioy their liues and liberties vnder mee, will not onely be Recuſants themſelues, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and draw others after them.</p>
            <p>As I haue ſaid in Parliament houſe, I can loue the perſon of a Papiſt,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:23110:305"/>being otherwiſe a good man and honeſtly bred, neuer hauing knowen any other Religion: but the perſon of an Apoſtate Papiſt, I hate. And ſurely for thoſe Polypragmaticke Papiſts, I would you would ſtudie out ſome ſeuere puniſhment for them: for they keepe not infection in their owne hearts onely, but alſo infect others our good Subiects. And that which I ſay for Recuſants, the ſame I ſay for Prieſts: I confeſſe I am loath to hang a Prieſt onely for Religion ſake, and ſaying Maſſe; but if he refuſe the Oath of Alleagiance (which, let the Pope and all the deuils in Hell ſay what they will) yet (as you finde by my booke and by diuers others, is meerely Ciuill) thoſe that ſo refuſe the Oath, and are Polyprag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke Recuſants; I leaue them to the Law; it is no perſecution, but good Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>And thoſe Prieſts alſo, that out of my Grace and Mercy haue beene let goe out of priſons, and baniſhed, vpon condition not to returne; aske mee no queſtions touching theſe, quit me of them, and let mee not heare of them: And to them I ioyne thoſe that breake priſon; for ſuch Prieſts as the priſon will not hold, it is a plaine ſigne nothing will hold them but a halter: Such are no Martyrs that refuſe to ſuffer for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. <hi>Paul,</hi> notwithſtanding the doores were open, would not come foorth: And <hi>Peter</hi> came not out of the priſon till led by the Angel of God: But theſe will goe forth though with the angel of the Diuell.</p>
            <p>I haue giuen order to my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and my Lord of <hi>London</hi> for the diſtinction, &amp;c. of the degrees of Prieſts; and when I haue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt from them, then will I giue you another charge concerning them.</p>
            <p>Another thing that offendeth the Realme, is abundance of Ale-houſes; and therefore to auoyd the giuing occaſion of euill, and to take away the root, and puniſh the example of vice, I would haue the infamous Ale hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes pulled downe, and a command to all Iuſtices of Peace that this be done.</p>
            <p>I may complaine of Ale-houſes, for receipt of Stealers of my Deere; but the countrey may complaine for ſtealing their horſes, oxen, and ſheepe; for murder, cutting of purſes, and ſuch like offences; for theſe are their haunts. Deuouring beaſts, as Lyons and Beares, will not bee where they haue no dennes nor couert; So there would be no theeues, if they had not their receipts, and theſe Ale-houſes as their dennes.</p>
            <p>Another ſort, are a kinde of Alehouſes, which are houſes of haunt and receipt for debauſhed rogues and vagabonds, and idle ſturdie fellowes; and theſe are not properly Ale-houſes, but baſe victuallers, ſuch as haue nothing elſe to liue by, but keeping houſes of receipt for ſuch kinde of cuſtomers. I haue diſcouered a ſtrange packe of late, That within tenne or twelue miles of <hi>London,</hi> there are ten or twelue perſons that liue in ſpight of mee, going with Piſtols, and walking vp and downe from har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to harbour killing my Deere, and ſo ſhift from hold to hold, that they cannot be apprehended.</p>
            <p>For Rogues, you haue many good Acts of Parliament: <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt,
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:23110:305"/>though hee were a child, yet for this, he in his time gaue better order then many Kings did in their aage: You muſt take order for theſe Beggars and Rogues; for they ſo ſwarme in euery place, that a man cannot goe in the ſtreetes, nor in the high wayes, norany where for them.</p>
            <p>Looke to your houſes of Correction, and remember that in the chiefe Iuſtice <hi>Pophams</hi> time, there was not a wandering begger to bee found in all <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> being his natiue countrey.</p>
            <p>Haue a care alſo to ſuppreſſe the building of Cottages vpon Commons, which are as bad as Alehouſes, and the dwellers in them doe commonly ſteale Deere, Conies, ſheepe, oxen, horſes; breake houſes, and doe all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of villanies. It is trew, ſome ill Iuſtices make gaine of theſe baſe things: take an accompt of the Iuſtices of Peace, that they may know they doe theſe things againſt the will of the King.</p>
            <p>I am likewiſe to commend vnto you a thing very neceſſarie, High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and Bridges; becauſe no Common-weale can bee without paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: I proteſt, that as my heart doeth ioy in the erection of Schooles and Hoſpitals, which haue beene more in my time, then in many aages of my predeceſſours; ſo it grieues mee, and it is wonderfull to ſee the decay of charitie in this; how ſcant men are in contributing towards the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of High-wayes and Bridges: Therefore take a care of this, for that is done to day with a penie, that will not bee done hereafter with an hundred pounds, and that will be mended now in a day, which hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will not be mended in a yeere; and that in a yeere, which will not bee done in our time, as we may ſee by <hi>Pauls</hi> Steeple.</p>
            <p>Another thing to be cared for, is, the new Buildings here about the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>London;</hi> concerning which my Proclamations haue gone foorth, and by the chiefe Iuſtice here, and his Predeceſſor <hi>Popham,</hi> it hath bene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to be a generall nuſans to the whole Kingdome: And this is that, which is like the Spleene in the body, which in meaſure as it ouergrowes, the body waſtes. For is it poſſible but the Countrey muſt diminiſh, if <hi>London</hi> doe ſo increaſe, and all ſorts of people doe come to <hi>London?</hi> and where doeth this increaſe appeare? not in the heart of the Citie, but in the ſuburbes; not giuing wealth or profit to the Citie, but bringing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie and ſurcharge both to Citie and Court; cauſing dearth and ſcarſitie through the great prouiſion of victuals and fewel, that muſt be for ſuch a multitude of people: And theſe buildings ſerue likewiſe to harbour the worſt ſort of people, as Alehouſes and Cottages doe. I remember, that before Chriſtmas was Twelue-moneth I made a Proclamation for this cauſe, That all Gentlemen of qualitie ſhould depart to their owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys and houſes, to maintaine Hoſpitalitie amongſt their neighbours; which was equiuocally taken by ſome, as that it was meant onely for that Chriſtmas: But my will and meaning was, and here I declare that my meaning was, that it ſhould alwayes continue.</p>
            <p>One of the greateſt cauſes of all Gentlemens deſire, that haue no calling
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:23110:306"/>or errand, to dwell in <hi>London,</hi> is apparently the pride of the women: For if they bee wiues, then their husbands; and if they be maydes, then their fathers muſt bring them vp to <hi>London;</hi> becauſe the new faſhion is to bee had no where but in <hi>London:</hi> and here, if they be vnmarried, they marre their marriages, and if they be married, they looſe their reputations, and rob their husbands purſes. It is the faſhion of <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>Naples,</hi> (which is one of the richeſt parts of it) that all the Gentry dwell in the principall Townes, and ſo the whole countrey is emptie: Euen ſo now in <hi>England,</hi> all the countrey is gotten into <hi>London;</hi> ſo as with time, <hi>England</hi> will onely be <hi>London,</hi> and the whole countrey be left waſte: For as wee now doe imitate the French faſhion, in faſhion of Clothes, and Lackeys to follow euery man; So haue wee got vp the Italian faſhion, in liuing miſerably in our houſes, and dwelling all in the Citie: but let vs in Gods Name leaue theſe idle forreine toyes, and keepe the old faſhion of <hi>England:</hi> For it was wont to be the honour and reputation of the Engliſh Nobilitie and Gentry, to liue in the countrey, and keepe hoſpitalitie; for which we were famous aboue all the countreys in the world; which wee may the better doe, hauing a ſoile abundantly fertile to liue in.</p>
            <p>And now out of my owne mouth I declare vnto you, (which being in this place, is equall to a Proclamation, which I intend likewiſe ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hereafter to haue publikely proclaimed,) that the Courtiers, Citizens, and Lawyers, and thoſe that belong vnto them, and others as haue Pleas in Terme time, are onely neceſſary perſons to remaine about this Citie; others muſt get them into the Countrey; For beſide the hauing of the countrey deſolate, when the Gentrie dwell thus in <hi>London,</hi> diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſchiefes ariſe vpon it: Firſt, if inſurrections ſhould fall out (as was lately ſeene by the Leuellers gathering together) what order can bee taken with it, when the countrey is vnfurniſhed of Gentlemen to take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with it? Next, the poore want reliefe for fault of the Gentlemens hoſpitalitie at home: Thirdly, my ſeruice is neglected, and the good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the countrey for lacke of the principall Gentlemens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that ſhould performe it: And laſtly, the Gentlemen loſe their owne thrift, for lacke of their owne preſence, in ſeeing to their owne buſineſſe at home. Therefore as euery fiſh liues in his owne place, ſome in the freſh, ſome in the ſalt, ſome in the mud: ſo let euery one liue in his owne place, ſome at Court, ſome in the Citie, ſome in the Countrey; ſpecially at Feſtiuall times, as Chriſtmas and Eaſter, and the reſt.</p>
            <p>And for the decreaſe of new Buildings heere, I would haue the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders reſtrained, and committed to priſon; and if the builders cannot be found, then the workemen to be impriſoned; and not this onely, but likewiſe the buildings to bee caſt downe; I meane ſuch buildings as may be ouerthrowen without inconuenience, and therefore that to be done by order and direction.</p>
            <p>There may be many other abuſes that I know not of; take you care my
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:23110:306"/>Lords the Iudges of theſe, and of all other; for it is your part to looke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. I heare ſay, robbery begins to abound more then heretofore, and that ſome of you are too mercifull; I pray you remember, that mercy is the Kings, not yours, and you are to doe Iuſtice where trew cauſe is: And take this for a rule of Policie, That what vice moſt abounds in a Common-wealth, that muſt be moſt ſeuerely puniſhed, for that is trew gouernment.</p>
            <p>And now I will conclude my Speach with GOD, as I began. Firſt, that in all your behauiours, aſwell in your Circuits as in your Benches, you giue due reuerence to GOD, I meane, let not the Church nor Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men bee diſgraced in your Charges, nor Papiſts nor Puritanes counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced: Countenance and encourage the good Church-men, and teach the people by your example to reuerence them: for, if they be good, they are worthy of double honour for their Office ſake; if they be faultie, it is not your place to admoniſh them; they haue another <hi>Forum</hi> to anſwere to for their misbehauiour.</p>
            <p>Next, procure reuerence to the King and the Law, enforme my people trewly of mee, how zealous I am for Religion, how I deſire Law may bee maintained and flouriſh; that euery Court ſhould haue his owne Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; that euery Subiect ſhould ſubmit himſelfe to Law; So may you liue a happie people vnder a iuſt KING, freely enioying the fruite of PEACE and IVSTICE, as ſuch a people ſhould doe.</p>
            <p>Now I confeſſe, it is but a <hi>Tandem aliquando,</hi> as they ſay in the Schooles, that I am come hither: Yet though this bee the firſt, it ſhall not, with the grace of GOD, bee the laſt time of my comming, now my choice is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away; for hauing once bene here, a meaner occaſion may bring mee againe: And I hope I haue euer caried my ſelfe ſo, and by GODS grace euer will, as none will euer ſuſpect, that my comming here will be to any partiall end; for I will euer bee carefull in point of Iuſtice, to keepe my ſelfe vnſpotted all the dayes of my life. And vpon this my generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, I hope the world will know, that I came hither this day to maintaine the Law, and doe Iuſtice according to my Oath.</p>
